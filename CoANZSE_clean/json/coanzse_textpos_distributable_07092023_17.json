    "text": "[Music] painting landscape it is about exploring our relationship with landscape and our our experiences with it and what we take out of it I see my paintings as work that that wash over you that it 's an emotional experience like music does and also the people who see my work always come up to me and say this reminds me of such-and-such a place when I was a kid or when I did this or when I did that and I really enjoyed that it 's brittle it 's brought back a lot of memories and and I think that 's one of the reasons why I paint landscape is because it takes me to places where I supposed to feel nostalgic about or that are a memory or experience and you know I suppose it touches on romanticism as well you know we look at landscape and experience nature and it 's in its grandeur and how expensive and how we don 't have any power over it has the power over us in its or inspiring its cinematic their the elements I want to try and I did a lot of abstraction when I was at art school and I found that landscape just evolved out of what I was doing I was gravitating towards that I would see landscape elements as I worked I always still like to throw abstraction to my work and some works even now our quite abstract introducing photography into my work through a lot of other elements into my practice that I found I could play with and give it give the work other dimensions so when I 'm outdoors photographing works and looking for images to paint I always try and find an image another federal thing that has elements of obscurity or elements of the limitations of photography I 'm looking for an image that will present itself as being a painting I think it 's one of those processes where you go into it sort of with excitement because you you don 't know what 's what the what what you 're going to come up with I 'll play around with it on the computer and change some color settings on it and conversation and then the wall and live with it for a while I 've got image will I 'll scream out at me and I don 't want to paint it I feel that taking a photograph and then painting it adds a different element to it and adds the element of the hand and the element of touched it commits an error because when you paint something it changes it become something else with a painting the painting is is of the hand and it has those lovely totalities that no other medium really has I love painting I mean I love the totality of paint that 's what really has drawn me a lot too to painting it 's the the feel of paint how it handles and what it can do and it 's texture it 's it 's the stickiness and the slipperiness of paint when you 're using it [Music] the dark wood series came about from going up to Kosciusko National Park at that stage that a lot of the trees that have burnt in the fires room I think about 2003 was still still standing I ghost witness about them with the windscreen wipers going they were gathering water so there 'd be a tree going up then was a sudden it would go into this walking in a large area of water and could be completely become something entirely different so I started playing with working on the distortions of of these don 't trees through water I thought it 'd be really nice to go back and revisit the big sort of color blending series the out-of-focus series that I did from about 2003 onwards what I tried to create with those earlier works was the sense of space there was no contradiction in the painting to create that sense of space there was no sharp decrypt to to make the image look blurry there was no need to create the far so I thought would it be nice to go back to try and do that create that contradiction that contrast in the image and it was really a play on the modernist idea of trying to create a flat surface as a painting but at the same time creating a surface beneath was the each of the water drop is a inverted landscape of what was behind buddy and focus so each water drop is distorted quite severely some more than others like this one here you can quite clearly see that it 's the image of what 's behind but upside down there quite badly so there 's brush marks and stuff like that which differentiate that part of the image from the behind which is totally smooth and rendered without any brush marks whatsoever [Music] one of my continuing themes that I keep going back to is the the the idea of the horizon in my work their horizons always had a fascination for me because I think of it as a place that it 's not real and even though that you are standing on a place that to some ways and horizon for me the horizon symbolizes something that is a place that you can never really reach and and when you look at it it 's almost like it 's the edge of the world and that 's where the edge is and there 's the abyss also like the relationship between the landscape and the sky at that point and how everything is compressed at at those points so as everythig I gets closer and closer to the land there are more and more things there 's more compressed information there as it gets and I love the tension between though that point between those horizon so as it gets to the horizon it is this almost of infinite compression of the information and I love that tension and I 've been drawn back to the horizon time and time again because of those elements Oh distance this painting does like a realistic painting but when you 're gonna close to it 's very very painterly quite raw there 's certainly a lot of areas that seem to have detail they 're up I just screwballs really a lot of all the watermarks here in the background I just read the scribbles of darker tone and I just chose to leave it like that I learned a lot by painting outdoors that I perhaps wouldn 't have learned from just working inside from time to time a trip around them and travel around the countryside driving around looking for an ideal place to paint you start to understand how light actually works in the environment you understand that as Cora once said that there 's a little bit of color from one thing in everything so this there 's always a bit of the color of the landscape in the sky and there 's always a bit of the color of the sky in the landscape I always like to try and create an illusion of space and I use a very limited palette I don 't know as many colors are probably any use at any one time five or six colors and I use those colors to float over one another so you get the warm color coming through it 's a cold color on top cold color pushes the image further back and the warm color wants to come at you and they sort of fight against each other and and you see we get that illusion of illusion of space is something floating close but further away especially with translucent objects such 're not actually painting the object in the landscape you 're actually painting the space and what happens to the light as it travels through that space when we look at a landscape we 're actually looking at the sky just the landscape happens to be on the other side of it and it 's further it goes back the most guide has to go through until it bleeds completely into the sky itself I 've played with quite a few ideas over the last 10 years and I think this exhibition highlights that over 20 years of painting now yeah I think come I 'm starting to feel a lot more confident about what I do the works that are included in the show I think bodies of work but I think I 've developed and and that have been successful you _"

    "text": "[Music] this exhibition takes us on a journey through the landscape of belly-land island off the coast of france in brittany through the eyes of two contemporary Australian artists during MacLeod and Luke 's cabarrus John Peter Russell lived for many years on the island of Bali ill and Lucan you and went visited belly ole and painted there in the same way that Russell would have a century ago John Peter Russell was one of the most formative artists of the world at that time he was great friends with Vincent van Gogh he had a huge influence on Matisse he was great friends with Monet rode his entire generation of European painters and Australian artists his life is one of the great stories of Australian art he went to Paris in 1888 or whatever it was with Tom Roberts and they made this great adventure together but Russell stayed there and he found his own genius loci on the coast of the most remote part of France Russell has always been important to me from the very first moments I started looking at painting and I had a 's work and his life story but it was a revelation you know it was a very new story to him I really didn 't know what to expect and I really didn 't get a sense from the paintings of what I was going to find it was much more dramatic and of course now I look at the paintings and I think Willy they have all that drama in them why didn 't I see it first there is a very overwhelming landscape very powerful landscape and having had someone who shows you how it can be done or a few guys that show you how it can be done it really is throwing down the gauntlet we are very different sorts of painters essentially and I think most great painter friends are and I think the the relationship that is formed between one another is of a curiosity about each other 's work I love going away with other people painting there 's something kind of quite nice about painting with other people with it it 's quite difficult on your own you feel like a victim here waiting for you to come and ask me how long I 've been painting and you know what are you doing and all those kind of stupid questions when there 's a few of you you feel like the safety in numbers I think but it is just a lovely process you don 't harass each other you 're not kind of constantly looking at each other 's works I 've noticed sometimes you don 't even know what the other person 's done until you get back but there 's a lovely sense of experiencing the place in the similar way I think one of the most standout differences between you and and I as painters is that you and is essentially spot-on with tone that is his biggest strength so he will put in the big strong shapes of the most dramatic shadows and shapes that he can see I come at a painting primarily and firstly with color and I observe what 's happening in any landscape and my response to it with color for me Luke saw the work was through that impressionist color but all and they 're quite different the way he deals with it there 's much more kind of pattern making and you know that colors really important but it 's not I don 't see them as being any more than homage to John Peter Russell s certainly not slavish imitations that 's for sure you know he 's found his own way of looking at them and I think that 's true of the larger works he 's done since he 's got back he 's also had a bit of space and time to actually think Harry 's going to interpret that landscape this is the one that engaged me consistently throughout the whole period of making this body of work I came and went from all of the other paintings but I kept coming back to this one because I realized that the scale of it sort of absorbed me bodily in the subject right when I scaled all these clips and got varying angles of these incredible rock formations and then you know down on this tiny little pebbly beach and the sea comes in and are amazing but these cliffs rise above you and and abbreviate your peripheral vision all the time so that 's what I was just sort of wanting to achieve in this work the sense of being plunged down into that kind of little tiny Bay it was a very very close claustrophobic little bay that has a fantastic view when I first walked into Luke 's studio I was really surprised delighted and blown away by the freshness of the palace the uniqueness of the vision the familiarity of the landscape yet it was so different from the paintings I had seen of Russell 's so while they were there and standing in many of the same spots as Russell they just had a completely different feel that obviously the painting technique is quite different the colors tones being freshly painted you you get that real sense of immediacy and then going into yeren studio how his people the landscape with the presence of himself as an artist with his fellow artists the claustrophobic feeling that he creates in all of his work and then to translate that into the done from the belly all works it 's based on walking down to the beach which was not the easiest thing it 's very steep walls and it was quite fun scurrying down but yeah you had to be a bit careful to get down there it 's slightly based on a photograph that Luke took actually he took a photograph of me and I loved the way there relationship between me the needles and my painting of the needles I 've stuck a staircase in there that isn 't actually there and I 've made the beach look a little bit more narrow and scary but I kind of like that idea of being a little bit precarious you sort of trapped on the beach waiting for the water to come in and in a funny kind of way a bit like the actor painting I think it provides Marriott gallery Museum and Sydney audience is in particular with an opportunity to see the work of two great Sydney New South Wales painters who 've been inspired by one of Australia 's great impressionist painters whose little known and art gallery of New South Wales I think provides a great conversation across the harbour where people can experience Russell 's original paintings and then come and experience Luke and urines work created largely on-site and then back in their respective Studios in Australia to get a deeper sense of what it 's like to work across time and place and how contemporary artists respond to place and the past [Music] you _"

    "text": "as you can tell from my extremely good command of the English language I 'm from this southern state of Australia called New Zealand so but I can say that when God created the world it said that he got it finally got a right in New Zealand but up here is pretty good too I have to admit so I 'm going to talk about some of the fill in a few gaps from Sharon and Sue and then talk about a case just to demonstrate how powerful a personalized lifestyle program can be and this one of my favorite slides is this slide about the human evolution and as you can see you know we actually in the last hundred years and specifically in the last six years have quite radically changed the way we live and I 'm not asking you to grab a club and go back to the caves that 's not necessary we 've been discussing other things but if you look at the risk factors for dementia and if you look and as a large study a good study I 'd called the a proof for gene which puts you at a higher risk for Alzheimer 's but they have very very low Alzheimer 's because they simply are not living like their chap at the end there slim they 're active they have a whole food diet they have very little of any processed food which we know in flames our brains and so you don 't have to go back there but clearly Alzheimer 's is an epidemic or and a perfect storm of our genetics and the environment that we are living in and we can do a lot about that now just to extend on the risk factors and I that they 're vastly different on the new one is air pollution or let remaining the fields sleep age is the highest risk factor this thing called leaky gut you may have heard about the gut brain access a whole range of risk factors so if we 're going to actually crack this nut about finding a solution to at least change the prognosis we 're going to have to come up with a theoretical model that would explain disease now I see clients who 've already usually have already been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer 's and occasionally moderate our Simas this is the case I 'll talk about today but we know for a fact that this disease process has started 20 sometimes 30 years and I 've even read of children with the fo4 gene be able to pick up different and cognition even in their teens so it 's a long process I 'm actually really optimistic of the future that we 'll be able to pick this up early and do something about it now I 'm just gonna flick through this because I have an one study just to go on the exercise just to show you the dose dependency and this is just one study that I found but the people in the extreme levels of fitness as they were older they could not find the case of Alzheimer 's so that just shows you if you are really really fit you 're very very unlikely to get our Simon 's now I was going to talk a little about to your fasting blood sugar so if you wake up in the morning you 've had no food and they take your blood sugar the higher there is this the larger the shrinkage of the hippocampus the memory center in here so your fasting sugar annual fasting insulin so insulin is secreted to drive the sugar into yourself so that we can have energy is a reasonably good reflection of how your metabolism how you are able to burn carbohydrates and as you get older unfortunately that gets a long with other things that gets challenged so this kind of concept of eating these what we call high glycemic foods all day and even the flower and total you know the breads that we have now will really spike your blood sugar and over time this will develop a metabolism in you that will result in a higher blood sugar and we 'll talk a bit more about there the diet that what we like to use so putting this all together an optimal brain day just to show you that it can be done because some of you we in but I can tell you that the vast majority of our clients are being diagnosed with cognitive impairment or Alzheimer 's actually do achieve this with with a lot of encouragement and support that they do to get it done so Sharon talked about the circadian rhythm there is evidence there getting some exercise first thing in the morning is a very good idea we 're going to open up our blood vessels in our brain we 're going to actually secrete neurotransmitters that will be helpful and we 're going to get going and the early morning light is what sets our circadian rhythm so we 're more likely to have better sleep at night and we talked about strength training see muscles are not just things that get us from X to Y they 're actually secrete growth factors that can go into the brain and help the brain grow those new brain brain connections now breakfast now this is a bit of an a funny breakfast because you 're all been told and my mother told me breakfast the most important meal of the day etc if you don 't have dementia but there is some emerging evidence that if you have an early meal at so early at five or six o 'clock and give yourself at least 12 hours before you eat again zero calories two things happen it triggers your brain it 's called Auto Fei G 's self eating that triggers your brain to start mopping up those toxins and debris that have been created by your thinking and by sleeping and it also starts to create ketones which is when you burn fat and so when people with cognitive impairment of the Alzheimer 's type we know that almost all of them have in their front door of their brain cell where you get the glucose and to give us energy it 's partly shut it 's struggling to get glucose in but the back door for ketones which are created when we burn fat as a secondary source of energy is still wide open even in the last stages of Alzheimer 's so by getting some ketones into those brain cells can make a big big difference and so by quality coffee there is quite a lot of evidence that coffee and tea can help prevent dementia and so that 's kind of an alternative of breakfast but before you do this you should get your doctor 's approval because things like diabetes and other issues can this may not be appropriate sharon talked about brain HQ i think it 's clear that the vast amount of evidence their brain HQ is the online training that you should do at least i think so and that 's the one we recommend what 's really good about it that after you 've been doing it for a while the software picks up what your weakest at and you press a button that 's got personalized program and you go on the I don 't like these because I find they 're hard to do but that 's exactly what you want to do you want to come up with a personalized program that 's filling in your weakness now the diet of course all the research has been done and we 've talked about the Mediterranean diet we put our clients I read this year was by a professor of Valter Longo and it 's called the longevity diet and he says he 's at university of california he spent 40 million dollars of research looking at various diets and the use of fasting but professor walls was a professor of medicine and she got very progressive multiple sclerosis since she said his story is quite extraordinary I 've got two children I am NOT gonna die and she went to the very experimental research the my studies and a whole lot of other studies and created this diet the optimal brain diet in a very simplistic form which is why I like it every day you 've got to have 3 green 3 cups of greens 3 cups of colored and 3 cups of sulfur now sulfur is really important to help us detox which we 're doing all this all the time and that 's a cabbage but it 's also the cruciferous vegetables we put all our clients on 2 cups of broccoli sprouts which is very like even up to a hundred times more sulfur than broccoli regulate and control the inflammation our brain we 've all got some information in our brain but people with our Simas have a lot more so we need to try and cool that down and and reduce the information in order to improve their prognosis now then it 's time for supplements very controversial area and what I would say to you is don 't go out and buy a whole bunch of supplements all our clients are on quite a lot of supplements but they 've been highly personalized and what you should do is spend twenty five dollars a year on a thing called ConsumerLab comm it 's an excellent reference material they are independent labs they check out the quality and cost of all the supplements and they summarize the research so if you go to consumer lab calm and go improve memory they will give you the very latest summary of the evidence about which ones might be useful and then they 'll tell you which brands and their lab they 've tested are the best value for money because you can pay spend a huge much benefit in fact fish oil some of the fish oils have been tested and they actually rancid and will probably do use a little bit of harm so you have to be very careful about that the future is looking very very promising we 're using some advanced sprays up the nose that can get in through the sphenoid sinus here and through the nerves into the brain and I think there 's some very exciting things for cognitive impairment coming well they 're here now but we clearly need to do to control trials vitamin D hasn 't been mentioned but the New South Wales University to study here not so long ago and come springtime 75% of you will either be deficient in vitamin D or savate definitely sub-optimal and so this whole crazy thing about I think we stay out of the Sun is wrong don 't get burnt yes but most of you are not getting enough Sun there 's a vitamin D receptor on most neurons or thousands of them and the vitamin D is actually act like a more like hormone rather than the cells that can help to improve cognitive function so we get all of it and I haven 't got one client who 's what I call an optimal vitamin D there is a sweet spot you can take too much so don 't go swallowing a whole lot of energy ask your doctor along with your blood pressure and cholesterol I 'd like to know what my vitamin D is we get it done in springtime after a winter and then you 'll find out whether you 're someone because there are genetic what we call snips there are genetic variances some people can have a lot of Sun and they still can 't really get that lever when they need supplementation a lot of you will need supplementation but I still think and there is emerging science there 's better get to your vitamin D from sunshine there 's other things going on in sunshine caught things called photons the energy of light are probably helpful we looked about that now we talked about language music social interaction now I want to just briefly mention dancing again and up the study I got very fascinated about this because when you partner dance the brain lights up like nothing else so in three dimensions you 're responding to your partner you 're thinking about the next moves you 've got the music playing and you there 's this new research to show that the hippocampus can actually grow in size from this increased density of sign APS 's it 's it 's early science and there 's people working on asking a question what 's the very best part of the dancing for the brain and there 's a thing called neuro jamming and I 'm emailing the scientists and hasn 't got back to me no surprise but I wanted to know what is he doing but he 's but we are starting the test what kind of things so I 've taken up the Western Swing and my partner tell us ask me sort of well what Btu hearing is I 'm not quite hearing the same beat unless it 's the offbeat sweetheart and but but it 's actually really hard I 'm a musician and challenging and I can see while it 's really really good for you so novelty and complexity in all things like sharing us who talked about but especially in dancing don 't go do the foxtrot if you 've done your whole life do something more challenging like the Western Swing I can tell you that 's quite hard the diet now this is an example of the walls diet this is one of my meals took me 10 minutes to whip up and so you know what we got here we 've got this nutrient density that 's what we 're looking for plant base but some meat and especially some fat and fish but nutrient density as we get older our stomach acid drops away our ability absorbed nutrients drops away we really to think about these three cups of greens 3 cups of coloreds and three cups of sulfur so literally 10 minutes to make all of you can do it it 's not a problem you just have to make the right choice and and start to move there and there are thousands of recipes like published random Patrol trials on her protocol showing reversal and improvements and models grossest on their protocol so there is some research but she 's also got a cookbook so you can find them online I want to talk about meditation this is the thing that probably challenges our clients which is the mean the mean for some reason and was resistant to do meditation but being in a calm focused state is extraordinarily good for your brain and actually we use a thing called neural agility which is a kind of a beating which in trains or turns your brain into the same frequencies as a deep meditative state so now it 's actually really easy we get people to lie down barely breathe breathing from their abdomen rather and just listen to the music and just go into a nice restful state and and Rudolf tansy use professor of neurology at Harvard an elite academic neurology position we just published a book about how meditation and other things can turn on healthy genes so this is a very powerful tool and certainly we get all our clients on are before you have any signs of cognitive impairment it not only can grow certain elements of the brains control stress but it can change your whole attitude to the half glass of all it really can do it I 've meditated for quite a while now and and then then you stop doing it on your phone wonder why you 're irritable again and it really is an important investment of your time and we 've talked about sleep now when I asked audience let 's ask this audience how many people within an hour of going to sleep have watched television or looked at their phone right most people so you 're not and you 're not the crazy Facebook people right but this can tip this blue light that we are receiving can turn off the melatonin and Sharron talked about by up to 20% now that can be the difference between a reasonably good night 's sleep and a bad one so we have to prepare for sleep and prioritize it so this is the optimal brain day summary as you can see just in about an hour hour and a half and get on with your day so this is the sort of thing that we get all our clients doing I 'm not going to do that I want to just talk about and push the envelope a little bit and talk about some and I call it experimental work it 's certainly not mainstream medicine and it shouldn 't be until we do the trials but just to express its share with you why I 'm optimistic about our Simas this is one of our clients mink she 's given me permission to share her story you see she 's a pro for four what that means is she has the high-risk gene from her mother and her father 2% of the population I like that and depending on which study you read they have between 50 and 80 even 90 percent chance of getting our son whereas if they live long enough she 's also got a whole bunch of other risk factors that I won 't get into but she 's at high risk of getting Alzheimer 's and sure enough was diagnosed with cognitive impairment in 2013 an official diagnosis of Alzheimer 's by a neurologist in 2014 she had a very determined partner who said I wanted to do everything for me took her to the GP read about hormones put her on hormone replacement and she had an immediate lift she saw a naturopath who started this thing called the Britton protocol and then she heard about what we were doing she contacted us and we don 't normally take advanced or mid-stage Alzheimer 's cases but we could tell that her partner was very supportive so we did take her on and she did extremely well and within six months the herself and her partner said I 'm feeling so much better and she 's able to get on with her daily tasks herself we 'll talk a bit more about that this is some research from neurology magazine just to show the blue line is the decline the inimitable decline once diagnosed with Alzheimer 's and the red line is if you have the APO for so not only do you get it more often but when you consider these results and this is just an anecdotal case but I will say that we 're publishing over 50 cases sometime later this year of diagnosed early Alzheimer 's and cognitive impairment that seemed to have stabilized so you 'll see this on her cognitive scores she 's down to the second percentile this is a woman that has a degree you 'd expect her to be somewhere in the 70th maybe the 90th percentile and she 's her same as as such to sit down to the second percentile six months on the program she 's on the sixth percentile that 's the overall but when you start to break it down into what we call these domains you see this flexibility processing speed executive function complex attention and look at this simple attention we 'll just flick through this because we were running out of time but her ability to pay attention 23rd to the 70th percentile and that 's actually when you take a detailed history that came out I can pay attention I can actually think I can plan and she gets through and her partner actually been on holiday and left her alone which is unprecedented she did have family nearby that would chicken but she was she was doing well and this is Meg and she 's a wonderful one of your million she 's got a really good quality of life and we continue to personalize and refine her program and so it doesn 't stop and you have to have it be very committed to this and have a very committed partner so that 's the the book and I want to reiterate this is not mainstream medicine it is anecdotal cases but they 're in this book by Professor Britton and I 've been over to train with him twice he 's a lovely human being a neuroscientist who studied why brain cells died for 25 years and came up with I think quite a strong theoretical model tried it and mice that worked in a couple of humans volunteered and then he was surprised himself to find that it seemed to be working so but if you if you want to understand the protocol most of it is actually quite bright we 've had 400 drug trials and there really isn 't any drug that alters the prognosis that might give you a little temporary lift but I think with the use of a highly personalised comprehensive multifaceted multifaceted program we might be able to end to interfere in this disease process early on and and change the prognosis so I think hopefully within five years we 've done the trial Sharon and mr. Martin and I are working on doing a similar trial and a multi-faceted program and hopefully within five years we 'll actually have a therapeutic program that can alter those terrible prognosis for Alzheimer 's so on that good note thank you [Applause] _"

    "text": "thank you for all coming today I am a northerner myself still live on the North oh I do travel over the Harbour Bridge to go to work so hopefully that 's acceptable they say that we 're an insular lot those of us that live on the north I 'm really excited to talk about this particular area as a neuropsychologist working with older people for many many years I always felt as though we weren 't doing enough has anyone here ever encountered a neuropsychologist oh you don 't want to we have all four people that spend hours with our clipboards testing your memory and doing lots of very detailed tests of all different parts of the brain to try and work out what 's going on when someone presents with early cognitive decline or dementia well I think the thing that we really have to do is we start needing we need to start doing more about it we have to I help people that do have cognitive impairments to live in the community for longer and B we have to try and prevent our brain why I decided I didn 't want to work in a hospital anymore I wanted to actually start a research program where we could look at different causes of dementia and what can we do about it so I do look into many different types of risk factors for dementia and Sue 's already told you about some of those but some of those that I 've been interested in particular have been depression which I 'm not talking about today but I will touch on also my team are interested in physical activity and nutrition sleep is one that I 'm talking about today it hasn 't been captured in all of the risk factors that have been documented in the literature it 's very new and so we 're really just unraveling the secrets of sleep and how they may contribute to the brain brains health and of course brain training is the other one so I 'll get started I hope you 've all got your thinking caps on because I have 15 minutes to cover three topics and I normally do one in about 25 minutes there 's anything that 's unclear um so first of all I wanted to talk about sleep so it first a show of hands anyone here have problems with this week okay so maybe about 40% of you so you 're all healthy so about 40 40 to 45 of healthy older people do complain about having difficulties with their sleep so a sleep does change as we age and it 's very important to understand that when we 're thinking or worrying about our sleep why is now sleep like it used to be it does change with age so this is what we call a sleep Hittner gram this is a hypno gram of a young healthy person and what happens when we sleep is we have 90-minute cycles we start off with these black periods here the Pointer works yes and then we go down into lighter stages of sleep and then into nice deep sleep cycle and then we cycle back up when we have a little bit of dreaming sleep for the next 90 minutes we do the same and then again we start to of the night but we start to dream more so which is why we often wake up after whipping after we 've been dreaming we remember our dreams but what happens to sleep when we get older actually from about the age of 40 our sleep starts to change considerably and it 's what we call architecture so starting here again the one on the right you 'll see that we have this period of awakening we go down into this very light stage of sleep you 'll see there are many more of these light stages of sleep throughout the night so we often feel as though we 're not asleep we are asleep but it 's not very good deep sleep it 's quite light so we have lots of those we also have less of this deep sleep so less of the purple and the orange and the blue bars and you 'll see we also have less dreaming sleep and also more of these black periods on the right-hand side so we have more awakenings during the night so that 's very typical of our sleep to occur with shorter sleep we seem to need less sleep than we used to we tend to get a bit more sleepy during the daytime and we also shift to going to bed earlier and waking up earlier has anyone experienced that but as they 've got older they tend to just wake up earlier so it 's called a circadian advance so our circadian system is very important in governing our sleep and essentially that works because when the lights go down melatonin in our brain secretes that seems like a sleep hormone and and when the lights go on it it suppresses again a melatonin is a hormone that is secreted in the brain and then regulates our sleep and it 's important to know that because we can actually influence our sleep just by how much light we have if we get up in the morning we have lots of good light exposure that 's a really good thing to do to keep that circadian rhythm working so the two things work together the other important thing about sleep to understand is we get what we called a homeostatic sleep home Esther so after long periods of awakening your pressure of four sleep builds up during the day so that 's when you get really sleepy at nighttime but if you go sleeping in the daytime for a really long period or even in the evening you 're not going to have that same pressure so what you do in the daytime is really important to influence the time of sleep and the quality of sleep that we have in the night time and I 'll tell you a bit more about that when we talk about napping and so why do we think sleep is important for a healthy brain it 's really important because a few years ago we discovered that sleep actually clears the brain of toxins of waste and of beta amyloid which is the protein that 's involved in our time as disease so there 's been some very nice experimental studies in animals but also in humans showing that if you deprive people of that nice deep slow-wave sleep if you experimental ii manipulate that you 'll produce more of of what we call cerebrospinal fluid from someone 's spinal cord basically you can get these these levels of this toxic kind of chemical so it 's really important that to understand that sleep is not just a product of other things it 's actually really important for inter and maintaining the integrity of our brain it also plays an important role in regulating our immune system and inflammatory processes that go on in their brain and it also creates important in laying down you brain cells so we do know now that there 's a part of the brain called the hippocampus which is the seat of memory and is also the part of the brain that 's involved very very early on in outside missus ease and sleeve actually facilitates the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus and that 's again another remarkable discovery that we didn 't know before it 's also important for laying down our memory so what happens when we take in new information in the daytime our memories are kind of stored somewhere temporarily and then when we sleep it actually lays hippocampus puts them somewhere else in the brain and then frees up our brain so that the next day that we can take more information in so it has some really important functions for the support of our brain in the short-term but also in the long-term unfortunately sleep problems are more common in people at risk of dementia so I said about 40% of people may report just having sleep problems if they 're healthy if they are in at risk stage of dementia where they do have cognitive impairment but they do are still very functional so sue was talking about remaining functioning is an important distinguishing feature of someone that doesn 't have dementia you can have some problems with your memory or with word finding and have what we call mild cognitive impairment but you do not necessarily have dementia but we do find even in those people that their rate of sleep problems is much higher about 65 to 70 percent of people would have problems with their sleep and in dementia it 's more common again so we have reversal of the day that that might wander at nighttime but we also have lots of daytime sleepiness lots of napping and really really poor sleep quality at night time the other big thing about sleep which is important to think about because it 's a modifiable factor is obstructive sleep apnea which is essentially snoring any snore is here it 's got to be some we know that that sleep disorder breathing even in very mild forms becomes more common as we older and what happens if if we 're snoring and actually gasping for air having an apnea or hypopnea a partial cessation of breathing while we 're sleeping we 're not only fragment our sleep so that we don 't have good solid sleep but we actually starve our brain of oxygen and that in turn creates damage in our brain so it 's really important if you snore or your bed partner snores to go and have that talk to your doctor and go and have it investigated if need be particularly if you have symptoms of daytime sleepiness that 's something that can be treated there is a gold standard Darth Vader mask but it 's very very successful it 's one of the best things you can do for your brain if you 're a snorer so some other factors affecting sleep exercise is a big one so Sue 's already mentioned that napping is another one so if you go into nap if you need a little bit of sleep in the daytime and need to take that edge off best to have than that just after lunch if you have a short nap of about 10 minutes that 's okay you 'll get benefits for a couple of hours after that so you might feel your moods a bit better not so grumpy and also you can I guess feel a bit more alert for things if you have a deeper sleep for bigger sleep so you might sleep for 30 or 45 minutes you 'll go into that deep sleep period and that means that when you wake up you will feel a bit groggy does anyone know that feeling and you go oh why did I do that why did I have have that sleep we 've actually had some of that nice restorative deep sleep and that 's okay to do that if it 's just after lunch so the siesta counter period 1 or 2 o 'clock might might be the period that 's right for you but do remember that it counts in your total sleep time at nighttime so don 't expect to have a nice big 6 or 7 hour sleep in the night time if you 're going to have a nap like that all the time it can be helpful to have a nap particularly if you need to go out at night you need to go to a family event you don 't know how you 're going to stay awake so it can take that edge off you 've actually fulfilled some of that sleep need or sleep pressure and so it gives you then a boost right through to the night time if you have a 45-minute nap about 2 o 'clock or so other things that can affect sleep or depression our expectation of sleep lots of medications that we take and of course will be available on the website and if you wanted to take any of them those down so what are the top 10 tips for healthy sleep well if the first go couple are kind of interrelated so depression or depressive symptoms one of the biggest risk factors for having poor sleep so in all of the analyses that we 've done of sleep one of the biggest predictors there 's not even clinical depression but just having depressive symptoms two people here have a reasonable understanding of depression so it can be different in other people so there may be a loss of interest or pleasure in things that you might have found enjoyable there might be sadness there might be low mood there might be irritability there might be preferring to socially isolate but you can also get lots of gastrointestinal symptoms in depression in ageing that are very different to how they may present in younger people and also anxiety so we may see more of these what we call mixed depression anxiety I 'm symptoms that occur together as sue said before depression is important in it 's really important that we treat it studies that have looked at people that do not have depression treated show they have a much smaller hippocampus that part of the brain that looks after our memory whereas some of the antidepressant medications can be helpful or even psychological strategies which you can get on Medicare you can actually get both billed on Medicare i 'm access to psychologists that maybe do cognitive behavior therapy for example keeping physically active is not only important for our bodies but it 's also important for our sleep if you were physically active in the daytime and mentally active you 'll have a much better quality deep sleep than if you 're just sitting around or if you 're not actually doing anything useful with your brain you need to keep it active and that in turn will ensure we haven 't_''_740.47 that nice deep sleep which is also where all the restoration and the clearing of the toxins and wastes occurs and it 's important again to think about your sleep expectations so okay I haven 't had a great night 's dwelling on it and because it actually contributes to having more poor sleep the next night so it 's important to think about what is it do I want from my sleep what time you know do I need to be going to bed if I 'm having a nap in the daytime doesn 't really matter if you know not having a good night 's sleep that night as long as I 'm functioning fairly well the next day so the more we catastrophize about our sleep problems the worse the sleep problems seem to get so there 's a bit of a vicious cycle as I said before melatonin is really important to think about in terms of it being suppressed during life so very important that you get up in the morning and have lots of exposure to light in the daytime open the blinds go for a walk and keep that body clock ticking on time there 's other things that are linked to the body clock tick ticking on time including behavior when we eat and do all those kinds of things all feed into they 're really having difficulties getting to sleep at night even taking melatonin from your can be prescribed from that your GP and can be a slow-release can actually help people get off to sleep and much better than taking sleeping tablets so sleeping tablets like the benzodiazepines anything with the Pam although had hypnotic still knots and things are not a good solution for sleep in the long term they will offer short-term benefits but they 're not advised for older people they contribute to cognitive problems to confusion to Falls and actually don 't work that they are addictive and they 're all as effective is actually looking at using more natural ways of correcting sleep weight problems I 've already talked about naps so it 's important just to know the timing of nap and the duration of nap will impact on your sleep talked about sleep apnea and medication some medications like beta blockers for example can affect your sleep caffeine of course dyes as you get older your sensitivity to caffeine changes so you may find that you can 't have any caffeine after say on your sleep alcohol cause alcohol is a great sedative isn 't it gets us all off to sleep well it it can be okay if you have just a small amount like sue said but the problem is if you have too much of it it then disrupts the architecture of your sleep so don 't know about you but I 've had a few nights where I 've had too many and I 've woken up at 00 a.m. absolutely wide awake and kind of get back to sleep again and that 's what it does if you have too much of it so it 's important you do to stay within those 1 to 2 drinks kind of guidelines after you 've tried everything if you wake up in the middle of the night you really can 't get back to sleep you need to understand that when you do wake up you 'll wake up from REM sleep most commonly and it 's usually around two o 'clock in the morning 3 o 'clock in the morning and when you wake up from REM sleep that 's like when you 're wired awake so if you wake up from REM sleep it 's important to allow yourself a good 20 minutes you can even expect to get back to sleep again because that 's what your brain has to do it 's not the same as waking up from a deep sleep or you just kind of doze back off again so it 's important to remember that if you don 't go back to sleep after 20 minutes do get up don 't lie in bed because then you 'll start thinking about everything you could have done should have done and all the rest of it I 'm so you 're better off to get up go into another room keep the lights dim don 't do anything too stimulating for the mind and after a while you 'll start to feel bored and you go back to bed and you 'll you 'll get back to sleep again pretty quickly usually if you 've tried all of the kind of these kind of methods I guess for improving your sleep and nothing helps your doctor and even consider you know talking to a sleep position or a sleep psychologist who can look in more detail and do some more analysis of the pattern of sleep keep a sleep diary and also have other investigations you can have four more overnight sleep studies to look at the efficiency of their sleep and if there are other sleep disorders occurring so I 'll just quickly go through exercise so as sue said exercise is a big component of dementia prevention that we 're all pretty much focused on even if you have dementia and you exercise your rate of functional decline will be much lower than someone that 's taking one of the the dementia medications so it 's the best thing you can do for a person with dementia to stop them from losing their functional abilities and that 's what we want to do right we want to keep people functioning as well as they can for as long as they can so exercise is really important interestingly all of these risk factors for dementia my rates are slightly different to Sue 's the whole conglomerated thing but the point is the third of the risks for dementia are due to these things that we can modify and all of these things diabetes hypertension a physical inactivity obesity and depression all benefit from exercise so certainly not going to do you any harm by tackling this and the rates of inactivity for older Australians are astounding so in the fifty to sixty four-year-old bracket age bracket 58 percent of people are not exercising at the levels they should and that it this increases to 61 percent and then 75 percent for those that are over seventy-five in the over 75 bracket a third of people are completely sedentary and we know that even in people that have disabilities exercise is really important so unless you 're lying in a hospital being completely unable to move there are certainly things that can be done in terms of exercise in the home environment and the benefits go beyond the brain so right throughout the body exercise has been basically hailed as the wonder drug in terms of its capacity to treat many different medical conditions to improving brain functioning including increasing the flow of blood to the brain also important for these protective chemicals in the brain that facilitate the new growth of cells in that part of the brain the hippocampus so they 're important for these things called neurotrophins and also they 're associated with reduced inflammation in the brain and less oxidative stress in the brain so these are all the bad things that we shouldn 't be doing and Dave will probably talk about diet but diet is another one that impacts on these levels of oxidative stress and inflammation so does exercise help our cognition if we start exercising now will it help well the answer is overwhelmingly yes everyone should start today exercising so it 's hard to do sometimes but we do have to try and do as much of it as we can and I 'll go through that but if we look at the data that actually links exercise to better cognition it is in general very very positive so one large analysis of data pulled all different studies from 24 randomized control trials which is as well as 21 studies where they follow people up longer to delije and they found that if people exercise at the rate they shall we can prevent have a 40 percent lowered rate of dementia so that 's quite astounding really if we look at what functions improve exercise seems to be associated with less shrinkage of the brain over time but also better memory and better functioning cognitive function generally so quicker thinking better attention better word finding all of those kinds of things an aerobic and resistance training or muscle strengthening seems to be the best type of exercise that you can do and I will go to that one study for example in the u.s. followed older people over 65 for six years and found that people that exercised at the rate they should had a 32% lower rate of dementia so this was a very well controlled trial that also followed people longer to Denis so what should you do does anyone know how much exercise give me a number how many minutes should we be doing a week how many thirty a day yeah put on so we should be doing in terms of aerobic activity probably at least thirty minutes of what we call moderate intensity activity so we want to get the heart rate going it doesn 't have to be at the point where you can 't speak you should still be able to speak so that 's moderate intensity for at least five days a week and you can actually add it up so if you have 12 minutes of excess of that kind of exercise and then you want to add on another 12 minutes later then it that is cumulative it does actually help to add it up or if you 're one of those people that does do marathons or like to do vigorous exercise or swimming then you can have 20 minutes a day for three days a week but it 's important to do the muscle strengthening exercise too I 'm sorry before I say that I should say there is a lot of interest at the moment in what we were calling this high-intensity interval training so it is actually going you know helpful yourself as hard as you can and then you can actually stop and kind of recompose yourself and get ready for your next interval and it 's been shown that that has particular benefits and the further brain there 's some nice work actually being done at the University of Sydney looking at that as well muscle strengthening is also important not actually just for our muscles but also for our brain so there 's been direct evidence linking doing resistance training to benefits of a cognition and for brain functioning and also for sleep and flexibility is important certainly important for maintaining functioning does reduce Falls and also improves people 's what we call activities of daily living so being able to carry out your usual tasks and things there 's not as much evidence or good trials linking flexibility training tai chi yoga and that kind of thing to cognition that 's not to say it doesn 't help but we just don 't have enough evidence yet to really say that it 's helpful i 'm conclusively so last up brain training anyone do any brain training a fairly new area and it 's a little bit of a murky area because there 's lots of I guess commercial money companies making lots of money out of people claiming all kinds of things so it is a bit of an area that we need to be careful about in terms of marketing versus evidence what is brain training look I guess it 's like a gym for the brain it 's working the brain out using different tasks we tend to use or get people to do repeated exercises using specific skills such as those targeting memory and we can either try to directly restore a function such as memory or we can try and use other ways to get around memory so problems so that we can support memory for example so we can either restore functioning or we can compensate for loss in and in an area functioning we can use computer-based tasks so there are some specific companies that have developed computer based programs specifically for brain training but the other thing is we can also use strategies to help you in your daily face better I remember I 'm something that you just heard or remember what you have to go and learn it at the shop so they both have a role to play Diaries and and using phone reminders and things are also very helpful just in everyday life and using white boards and stuff so there are strategy based kinds of methods and so what does cognitive training do what we actually know that if you look at people that have a higher level of education or more occupational complexity they can withstand more out Simas pathology in the brain without showing any symptoms then someone that hasn 't had that same level so it basically it gives us what we call cognitive reserve it gives us the ability to be a guess a bit resilient against this outsider 's pathology in our brain and still maintain our functioning so cognitive reserve is a concept that 's been very well studied and it 's been I 'm suggested that if we do keep her brains active at the levels that we should a mental activity throughout life is associated with evidence around cognitive reserve what we 're now trying to do is say well we know this now about cognitive reserve how do we actually use this to build the connections between the brain so in to strengthen the connections that we have there and you 'll see here in this picture this is a picture of the of the brain it 's very small but that 's the hippocampus that part mare and this is it very very small it 's a small component of it and what we 're wanting to do with cognitive training is take this neuron I guess that 's very depleted doesn 't it 's like a tree that don 't have any branches and we want to grow these branches or dendritic arborization we call its ability to connect with all of the neurons better so we want to strengthen these connections and so there 's evidence that cognitive training does work it does work in healthy older adults it 's actually been shown are probably that the most to have the most benefits in healthy older adults with some really big international have mild cognitive impairment in terms of improving memory it also works in Parkinson 's disease and also in people with depression and we 're now starting to try and work out well what 's cognitive training if it 's done well and in research studies what 's it actually doing in the brain and getting some evidence that it is actually changing the network structure and importantly it doesn 't hurt so you may as well give it a try right it doesn 't work for people with dementia so it 's very important to be clear about that if you have a colleague or loved one or friends that has dementia it doesn 't work there 's no good evidence that it works so other things that can be done for people with dementia in terms of using goals or improving their memory or using strategy training approaches but these cognitive computer methods don 't seem to show any efficacy in people with established dementia and so what do you need to do if you 're going to do brain training this is the golden question right what studies so far show that the most evidence is around those things that are being done in a research environment or in a group based setting so having a council what we need is a room full of computers and then we need to be able to provide a therapist to come in and who understands brain training and if we deliver it three times a week it 's probably got the most benefits of an hour at a time you need to challenge the brain if you 've always done crosswords don 't do more words you need to give the brain something really difficult to do so some of the computer-based approaches are really good for that because you can actually start with something that you are a bit good at get you involved in it and then you can actually build up from that it is a bit like physical exercise you do need to keep doing it so needs to be at least 30 minutes at a time perfectly an hour or two to three times a week and we believe and we 've done our combine the computer-based training with teaching older people strategies about how to improve their memory but also targeting other things exercise depression sleep and this is a little bit like the finger trial that 's who told you about that there is evidence if you use this multifaceted approach to dementia prevention that you probably do have the greatest capacity to delay or at least slow dementia we don 't know definitively yet if we can actually cure dementia using these prevention approaches and this is just some examples of some of the different commercial brain training programs that do have an evidence base around them so Lumosity which is nice to do and is quite fun Brain Age cube for example some of them do charge you but if anyone 's interested in brain training feel free to drop me an email and we can give you some more information about what might be effective as I said you can also use other things that take the strain off the brain you can use memory reminders diaries are really good like a week to a page you can write remember them because you 've written them so you 've heard it you 've seen it you probably don 't even need to go back to your diary but it 's there if you need to you can put to-do lists in there and you can use post-it notes and things and there 's lots of different other internal strategies and when we give the long version of this talk we usually go through a lot of those exercise that 's of how to actually can you chunk things or rehearse things to help you remember them better or help our new faces but I can 't go into those now sorry so in summary sleep is really important for the brain it is emerging as the new risk factor it does have an important role to play in the brain it seems to be linked to dementia it 's associated with faster decline if you 've already got dementia it 's best to think about managing your sleep using non-drug methods and certainly talk to your doctor if you find that using some of these techniques actually help exercise me what is your top tip for preventing dementia then I usually say it is exercise but there are a few questions around exercise in the literature at the moment and I think it was as we said everything right we need more research brain training definitely has beneficial effects for healthy people people with mild cognitive impairment but not dementia need to do it at least three times a week keep the brain challenged and as sue said it 's really important that you do engage in other things learning your musical instrument stay engaged in your community be socially active those things are very I guess under studied at the moment but we do think that they have a really important role to play in maintaining independence and preventing dementia we do have a clinic at the University of Sydney which is called a healthy brain aging clinic for anybody aged over 50 we see people that have concerns about their memory we need a referral a GP referral if you 'd like an assessment for your memory we have nasty people like me neuropsychologist but we also we 're actually really looking for people that don 't have any concerns about their memory either because we usually say to people come along to the clinic and they say I have any concerns about my memory but then it turns out that they do so we 're really looking for people that feel as though that their their brains are going pretty well because we find that they 're the hardest people to actually get into these kinds of settings our clinic is free we if people report would do brain scans to sleep studies and all kinds of things so if you 're interested our details are there and of course this will be available on the website thank you [Applause] _"

    "text": "thanks for coming and congratulations Northern Beaches for doing this I used this to get the Honorable Philip Radek to a meeting about dementia friendly communities when he was a bit reluctant I said Northern Beaches are already doing it oh ok so we have a meeting now so well done and it 's good we 're getting there we 're getting there so yeah I 've only got 15 minutes and I 'll try and cover a little bit on successful aging and then talk a little bit about dementia but I 'm looking around I 'm thinking there 's already people here who are successfully aging so that 's really good hopefully you can learn a little bit do you all realize in Australia that every year we add an extra month to our life expectancy so every year we live we live a month longer and this is the graph light blue for the females dark blue for the males and it 's still going up now in America it 's flattened off and is going down and interestingly enough Mexico is going up and we 'll 're going to have to import people before too long from Mexico which is kind of ironic and you can see men in Australia on average live to 81 women to 85 so I just want you to remember that age but before I move to the next slide I would love to see at what age people in this room would be happy to drop off their perch 75 80 85 we 've had a couple of die okay 90 95 a hundred we have some brave souls okay so there was no one before 85 now at 85 one in three of us have dementia at 90 it 's one in two so if you don 't have it you 're living with someone that does and that 's really important to remember when you think about our future so um I love this picture the Fountain of Youth wouldn 't we love to find it I have colleagues in the US and Europe who actually think in Australia we have found it because of that up that life expectancy line that 's still going up but what all women sorry guys but we don 't have the Fountain of Youth that 's the way it is but we do have people who 've age successfully I just want you to look at a few of these these photos none of them are faked they 're all real people and then I want to ask you what if they all got in common now you probably won 't be able to pick that easily we 've got everything from obviously a very elderly lady who you will meet in a minute an elderly cyclist the gentleman who holds the I think it 's the 95 year plus pole-vault title tai chi a couple chasing their sheep and the gentleman that the bottom right hand corner is running the London Marathon I forgotten his name but he 's done it a few times and I think he 's 98 something like that so we 're never too old so as I asked before what are these people have in common they 're all over 85 they 've all exceeded their life expectancy they 're all outside and being active activities 485 plus year-olds and I think that 's really important why do we sit down when we get old there 's no reason to do it they don 't do it in other countries necessarily they have not let age get in the way of doing what they want to do and I think that 's incredibly important so how do we stay fit and well into our 80 's and 90 's you know how do we live well until we die ideally we drop dead on the golf course the bowling green as one gentleman said he wants to drop dead in coals because he wants to get his revenge on having to stand in queues for long periods of time I thought that was good and how do we avoid the unpleasant conditions of older age such as dementia so I will talk a bit about that in a minute but I want to introduce you to my pin-up girl madam Jenna Coleman is the oldest living human she 's actually died now she died in 1997 she was 122 and a half and just just up fencing as in the fencing sort not the paddock sawed at 85 she rode a bicycle till she was a hundred and then she had to stop because the Jean done took her bike away because she had macular degeneration and kept running into people she lived alone till she was 110 she had a glass a large glass of port wine every day now the two cigarette today is interesting she had to walk up and down three flights of stairs to smoke them so she probably got more exercise she probably did more good than bad and a kilogram of dark chocolate each week she did give up smokey at 120 and a couple of my smoking patients said well there you are at Kilda she poured olive oil on her food Mediterranean diet and rubbed it on her skin and she outlived husband child grandchildren but not great-grandchildren and she died at 122 without dementia so I think that 's quite important because often we think it 's inevitable that you will she was active and involved and I think that 's really important so what from for centenarians studies so forth studies looking at people who 've lived well past a hundred and are still going strong and that 's in Okinawa in Sardinia in Australia and in New England in the US so I 've just distilled what the clearly worthy factors that allowed people to successfully aged now the first one is having the right genes so that 's something you can 't do anything about but clearly longevity is hereditary and if your parents live to old age so that 's important the second one is really interesting it 's have the right personality so be the glass half-full sort of person be positive not negative and I think those people that really get uptight about just little things are the ones who are going to die early which is probably a good thing but you know seriously if you can you know they say don 't sweat the small stuff you know worry about big things but be positive about life that is really important so reducing stress be physically active and that is terribly important really is be mentally and socially active and hopefully you 're being mentally active eat and drink well we talked about the Mediterranean diet has been quite positive there are others with good results as well and drinking well we I mean I 'm a gin and tonic girl myself thank you Kate Frederick 's you introduced me to it that 's why we 're going so well yeah but you are allowed to have some alcohol we say two drinks a day but at least one preferably two alcohol-free days a week just to prove you 're not an alcoholic and also you save a bit of money on those days maintaining independence so not accepting help is really important we we often think for older people all you should get a cleaner and should get someone to help you with your shopping or your cooking or whatever that is disabling people and so the thing is stay as independent as you can keep going out keep driving keep doing what you can and don 't accept help except for short periods of time while you actually need it and finally avoid disease and but there 's a whole lot of things you can do around diabetes things like making sure you have your flu vaccine the flu getting your blood pressure checked having your bone mineral density checked a whole lot of things you can do at all ages to avoid disease so I think that 's that sort of that 's my the positive net message I was then asked to talk about dementia generally and before I do I 'll give you the definition because there 's often a bit of confusion um dementia comes from demons meaning without mind and I guess that 's in a way what happens at the end but it 's dementia is the generic name for the progressive irreversible syndrome of impaired memory intellectual function changes in personality and behavior and they all or together they cause a significant impairment in function so if you occasionally can 't_''_565.64 remember which role you park the car in or occasionally forget where you put your car keys or like one of my lovely patients got sacked by her bridge partner but you 're still functioning well that need to have changes in day to day function you need to not be able to look use a mobile phone not be able to work out how to put the keys in the car when you eventually do find it or the police find it for you it is quite important to understand that so that 's dementia generally in Australia the commonest cause of dementia is Alzheimer 's disease and they 're often used interchangeably because about 70 percent of dementia in australia is due to Alzheimer 's disease Alzheimer was a German pathologist from southern Germany he described his disease in 1906 we are now a hundred and twelve years later and we still don 't know what causes it and we still don 't have a cure how many other common disease have can we say that about so it is a real real issue so Alzheimer 's disease is the most common vascular dementia used to be called stroke related dementia or multi-infarct dementia which is often can happen after small strokes in the brain or after a big stroke that 's the second most the age of 80 mixed dementia where you get bit of Alzheimer 's and a bit of ask a few vascular changes that is what we often see in people 's brains when they leave your past 80 into 92 men surely the Lewy bodies is interesting Louie was a german pathologist who happened to be a student of professor Alzheimer he described little pink bodies in the cells of brain in brain cells if you have them in the back of your brain you get Parkinson 's disease if you have them in the front of your brain you get dementia with Lewy bodies some people just call it Lewy body disease but they are a little different in that in dementia with Lewy bodies you get some memory but not so much memory it 's more visual hallucinations vivid visual hallucinations people will tell me how the crocodile is blinking their eyes or the way there 's fluff on the end of the rabbits ears you know it 's quite they 're very vivid and although the crocodile may have been scary often they 're not scary but 's where they 're a bit stiff and a bit stooped and they can 't move so quickly and memory is often relatively well preserved and they fall asleep really easily I saw a man on Monday and halfway through the consultation suddenly just dropped his head on and went to sleep and snored in the middle of our clinic and his wife said yes this is what he does all the time that is pretty typical you see that in dementia with lewy but it 's frontotemporal dementia you see it in younger people it 's not common fortunately are you said in older people as well because it 's quite hard that 's when people make really odd decisions if they have the frontal variant if they have it in their temporal lobes they get speech problems and it 's almost like they 've had a stroke it 's not that common Parkinson 's disease with dementia you can get dementia on top of Parkinson 's disease and there 's lots of others recently a former head of Woolworths it was in the paper I think two weeks it 's rare it 's rare and it 's rapid and it 's very unpleasant but it 's not that common whereas a RBD alcohol-related brain damage is and the good thing about alcohol-related brain damage is that if you stop drinking the alcohol the brain damage often stabilizes so you know there 's there 's people who have to decide is that the brain or the bottle and they 're different people think different things so then they 're just look there 's a hundred and twenty plus types of dementia but they 're the common ones they 're what we see I work at Hornsby hospital and I work down in southern New South Wales in batemans bay moorea and in Armidale in Northwest New South Wales and I see all these but by far the most I see a Alzheimer 's disease and mixed dementia that 's by far the most common you 've heard some of the stats from councillor Philpott already a lot of people with dementia yep 1800 new cases a week they say and as I said before it 's it 's common one in four at 81 in two at ninety and most people in this room wanted to live to 90 so I think that 's really important it is actually the leading course of cause of death now for women and the second leading cause of death for men so this is the commonest cause of death in Australia and we still don 't know a huge amount about it so that 's why it 's really good you 're here today and that 's why we 're here today what causes a lot of disability in the over 65s and there 's around 25,000 people under 65 with dementia my youngest patient was 31 and six months pregnant when she came to me she had pure Alzheimer 's disease she was just really unlucky she had a mutation a genetic mutation neither of her parents had it they were still alive and working and her daughter when did not have it that the daughter she was pregnant with really really sad case but this is you know you can see it at a very early age more common in it 's often misdiagnosed now risk factors what can we do to prevent too this is our timers disease but it sort of goes for vascular dementia and mixed dementia as well about a third of cases of outs homers disease are related to seven modifiable risk factors and Sharons going to show this slide as well and often say to people this is probably one of the most important slides it 's probably the most boring but it is really important have a look at that what is on that list diabetes okay we can treat diabetes midlife obesity you just look around you when you go into the shopping center we have major problems with midlife obesity low cognitive activity that 's sitting staring at a television all day not being involved like you guys are now and actually being involved midlife hypertension high blood pressure that 's not treated depression quite interesting that 11% of dementia can be related to depression and then the last two smoking 11% it was 14% when this this some analysis was done first which was about 9 10 years ago but decreased and Australia is really good for smoking and then the last one is the really important one 21 percent of dementia is due to low physical activity and that 's what 's really important that 's what we can do a lot about it 's interesting because The Lancet which is one of the premier medical journals in the world last year in July published they had a Lancet Commission on dementia and they published an incredibly comprehensive and I would have to say quite boring report on prevention intervention and care you can download it if you are so inclined but it is the best summary of what we know currently on knowledge in dementia and I think the the this this pictogram below it is really says it all that one in three cases of dementia could be addressed and you can it can be prevented and you can do it by increasing education physical activity and social contact well you 're doing the educational social activity now so that 's really good and if you walked here and I don 't know how far away some 's really good and you can do it by decreasing hearing loss so hearing loss in midlife is now turned out it wasn 't_''_1077.71 on the first slide on the previous study but it is hearing losses is felt to be strongly a strongly a risk factor hypertension you heard that before obesity smoking depression and diabetes so the same exactly the same factors and it 's really really important that we address those does it work does prevention work there is one study called finger and it 's short for the finished geriatric study and it goes on but what they did was they took twelve hundred and sixty older people who had risk factors for developing dementia and they randomly allocated half to a program in which they really modified their diet they did lots of exercise they did cognitive training and they monitored their vascular risk factors like the cholesterol and their blood sugar and their blood pressure versus people who who just will give an advice about good health and after two years there was a clear difference in cognitive thinking memory and thinking in the exercise now that that study continues but I think it gives us if you like proof of concept that in a randomized trial that 's the gold standard you can improve your risk and in fact you know there was a significant difference between the two groups after two years so basically that 's my message in terms of prevention the lady in the top left hand corner is Ruth frif Ruth Ruth is and it was an Australian she 's died as well I think she died at 104 she was still writing her exercise bike just before she took up exercise at 75 because she thought she was being a couch potato so it 's never too late and she held World Records for javelin shot put discus and hammer throw and she held including into her hundredth year and then the others are rare are particularly around just staying active you know they say playing a musical instrument learning a language eating worlds in the centre because I think that is important but staying involved is really really important thank you [Applause] _"

declarations of interest are there any declarations of interest this evening councillors no declarations of interest thank you page six there are no presentations this evening item seven questions from the public i 'll pass over to the general manager thank you madam mayor um tonight there 's four questions from the public um the first is from uh keith sullivan keith has put in a submission in regard to the potential for a relocation of our sporting precinct and has asked that he hasn 't received a response to um apart from an acknowledgement from the mayor [Music] and um has raised a number of questions for councillors because they are is there a business case including a cost-benefit analysis for all options relating to the the sports ground relocation if so could they be made made available to the community the second point is if not will council take action to ensure that the interests of the community are protected by having a detailed business case prepared by an outside qualified professional to enable council to make an informed decision and the third bit will the council in conjunction with this action have a similar cost benefit analysis and business case developed for the proposed new library hub which is understood that currently provides for the demolition of the existing bob hooper center um included would be the expansion of alternative sites that is the first submission are you taking that on notice or answering that general manager thank you the second question of the second uh letter is from um sig soviet um in in the correspondence it says my name is sig soviet i 'm asking on my own behalf and following four related questions directed to the mayor what date was the town improvement levy as were the specific and formal processes for which the ti fund was established three since inception has the council formally or informally changed the purpose of the ti fund and four was the duration of the levy as established open-ended or if not what is was the expiry date what is the expiry date for the ti special rate thank you general manager that as that email a question was directed to me i will take that on notice pending consultation with relevant staff members thank you the third letter is from philip and it 's directed to the mayor uh in regard to your reply to my liver my letter about the manipulated slash fake src poll and my questions to dr sharti one did you make a commitment to look into the and there are a number of people who were in attendance at that meeting who were willing to testify as to what was said just because it was edited from the minutes doesn 't change anything i trust that when you say you would do something and why would you not want to look into the the rule another numbers of residents against fluoridation three as to my unanswered questions to dr shanti i 'll repeat what i said before she made a commitment to get back to council with the answer to my question as a neighbor on resident and rate payer i expect you to follow this up and get a reply four and may i remind you and all councils that you were elected to serve the residents of oberon in their best interests and not the other way around i asked these same questions at the april meeting and i and you refused to answer them claiming you had dealt with them or their where is the proof simply saying the words i 've dealt with the issue is not good enough it means nothing to the residents of oberon you have not yet yet answered my questions about the sr src poll and dr shanti if you again refuse to answer these questions could you please explain to the 75 percent of residents in obon who do not want their water supply poisoned as to why you will not answer the you stood for council to serve the residents and not the other way around councils should always respect the wishes of the residents first over their own personal views especially when the overwhelming majority do not want their water poisoned thank you general manager and my response is also unchanged i have replied a response on two separate occasions and i 've got nothing further to add to this matter thank you on the final the final letter is from mr hardy dry him the first point is can g and wallace please share with the community what brought about the change in title from the director of finance and community services now reclassified as corporate services director does council have a current director of finance is the if this is correct all structural changes must be ratified by councillors prior to them occurring i 'm happy to answer that question now madame air and um those though the answers to those questions were previously provided to council and council endorsed that structure so i think that answers that question the second point is can gm walls please elaborate on final cost of the project is the o 'connell ball in it is rumored council staff allegedly having advised residents that the ball was not operational due to some legal issues indicating that the ball slash tank could be on the wrong location why was the community not informed on these developments relating to the o 'connell ball i can also answer that question madam mayor and the boar reason is is active it is on the right land um queries around old title versus a new title when council undertook a subdivision on that parcel land um have been answered and the cost of the ball was in has been previously provided to councillors within the um reallocated budget the third question relates to residents were informed 2019 the purchase of the house and dart street was a sound investment proposition justifying a further 40 000 for the renovations recent developments as pointed out by council mccarthy last meeting put the sound investment decision in doubt oberon 's timber industry had dozens of staff houses which were sold off in the 1980s and 90s as employee sentiment changed and own home and our own location just as it 's happening with oberon council trying to attract staff now preferring to live in bathurst rather than oberon leading to a vacant home in dart street paid for by residents are now subsidised by residents when will the council look after residents assets and investments filling this vacancy collecting rent um the answer that question is uh the current uh dwelling is in the hands of an agent um under covet those are restricted in how they can operate however it 's envisaged that that rental accommodation will go out in accordance with those public health requirements um the final point is that uh in closing questions from april meeting are still outstanding when will the mayor and gm respond to those an answer that is the questions matter man thank you and in response to the last comment of mr dreiheim 's questions um i i have answered mr dreheim 's inquiry by email thank you general manager confirmation of minutes councillors page six the recommendation is at the

possibly occurring with the other two facilities within the precinct he asked if we could have a meeting if i could facilitate it to discuss some of his suggestions and i am at the moment facilitating that meeting so they are potentially positive developments uh he has some concerns but mostly he 's very positive about the work that 's been done the um letter of the 23rd of april from sig uh salvik

further to report um that was what happened at the meeting and uh if if anybody wants um anything more we can fill them in thank you councillor councilman kevin uh thank you madam mayor um i think is excellent um i think currently there are um they 've been issued ten fines if i 'm not wrong with several others coming along we 're doing i think the upper macquarie is doing a great um a great job in encouraging people to actually uh fix up the problems with weeds prior to them and getting to that uh getting to that situation which is obviously what we don 't have to do um and um there was a interesting article on the central west daily which is the orange paper um i think it was two to three weeks ago about the upper macquarie county council so um and we also understand the mayor of orange has been very [Music] interested in the activities of the upper macquarie county council and we are there is some um potential that we may be asked to assist other people in putting appropriate regimes in place uh uh to enforce the biosecurity act because we 're seeing it currently at the forefront of this well done thank you any questions on this one councillors i 'm going to put the item 1201 over on youth council the recommendation is that council receives report item 1201 is information can i have someone to move that please council capable in a second to please councillor callum councillor cable yeah thank you thank you madam mayor um yes it was a a fairly quick meeting um it was good to get uh all of the youth councillors together um there was a couple of surprises for me there one thing that i was heartened by was that uh they are no better at zoom meetings than we are and the other thing was i was taken with the number of them who are still at school who um whose main aim was to get back to school they were missing they were missing the um the school the regularity and and all of that sort of thing so it was it was a good good opportunity to get together with the young people thank you councillor councillor callum nothing further madame thank you any other questions and queries on this one councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor carried item 1202 community services committee recommendation is that report would be received as information can i have somebody to move that please councilman mckibben and the second of police counsellors council kellum thank you council mckibben um thank you madame an excellent report and i think it 's good to um what 's being discussed about what we have to do when we come out of it and also looking at the more vulnerable members of the community and how can we can assist them in this covert 19 uh situation um so and also looking at obviously the tourism sector and how we can uh recover from the covert 19 obviously that all these things are largely dependent on um how quickly we can get back to normality or subnormality um and people start uh traveling again and people can move out of isolation obviously as um i think was indicated before in by actually um council during the prayer there are a number of people in all areas that have lost their jobs or working at reduced hours or that are suffering so i think this group is those things thank you councilman any other comments or questions on this one oh counselor caleb sorry thank you madam mayor um i support uh councilman kevin 's words um the last issue on the report of course is where um the hong kong michael mccormack talked about connectivity in the regions um and i hope that uh he gets rather enthused by this and we may get uh a better service out out in the regional areas thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you [Applause] page 19 item 1203 black springs community hall committee there is a recommendation there in two parts councillors that the report item is received for information and that the black

move that recommendation please council mckechnie do i have a second of councillors councillor mckibben thank you councillor mckickney yes madam mayor um fairly straightforward [Music] the process has followed all the guidelines and the selected or recommended contractors or suppliers who 've met the criteria and they made all the whs insurance requirements so i think it should be accepted thank you councillor councilman thinking about a mayor um i agree with councilman um the only comment that i would have um i assume that these people on the panel we have a some sort of standing order agreement with them for when the sort of thing you do have a standing order which basically has terms and conditions and says if you 're engaged these are terms and conditions that apply and it 's usually somewhat different from a purchase order oh yeah through the chair there is a wet higher and a dry higher in terms of conditions in terms of when we do engage a a contractor or a supplier and that clearly stipulates the terms that we expect thank you thank you technical services director said it council mckibben any other questions here councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 26 councillors item 1302 policy review policy 2103 leave policy and 2 126 domestic and family violence policy there 's a recommendation in two parts there councillors that the revised policy 2103 leave be adopted as presented revised policy 2126 domestic and family violence be adopted as presented can i have someone to move that way please counselors council mckibben and councillor callum councillor mckibben um councilman kevin you 're telling me mike sorry madame you turned away from your mic screen that i 'm looking at the items sorry um just because i find it hard to flash back and forward um so i think both these policies are obviously uh required and needed and the domestic confirm the violence one um obviously has to be adopted um i think uh from memory it allows it 's 10 days for permanent employees and up to 10 days for casual employees um i 'm just wondering the up to 10 days for casual employees how is it assessed exactly what entitlement a casual employee is entitled to if it says up to 10 days per annum um i notice there 's no carry over from year to year and i do think the general manager um um i do think um that it was not the leave policy was marked up and also um have we just have we have we done any financial implications as to what the domestic and family violence um adoption could cost us we have to adopt it i absolutely support that but i just want to know if there are any financial implications because it days gives so it gives an employee a permanent employee can take up to ten days a year and then it 's a bit uncertain because the casual employee can take up to 10 days a year what that may mean to the general manager yeah through the mayor yeah council of the cubans right there is some discretion um in regards to whether a casual employee and what and what part they 're of would be they would be entitled to generally that would probably relate from our perspective to the timing around how much casual work they do for council so there yes there is some discretion in regards to the cost i hope it costs us nil however they are something that we need to be responsible we need to respond to and at the end of the day a majority of our staff subject to a number of criteria that we would otherwise go through are able to take an additional 10 days of leave and that would be an additional 10 days times the number of employees that we have however in saying that i i suppose my question is should we make a provision in the accounts for this obviously it would be um not appropriate to make a full provision because you know not every employee is going to take it but should we for prudence at least make a provision or some allowance that i don 't know and i leave it to management but it could be one or two employees take it a year think it comes on through the chair from my person that 's too many um however we do we do cater for that now as but so as part of this employer leave entitlement we will cater for the for that through our accounts not for everyone but we will cater for it in some degree so there will be a line item in the accounts that says provision for domestic and and family violence a bit like sick leave or something through the chair yes there will be thank you thank you council calum um i 'm happy with both um leave policies i know in the family domestic violence leave policy on paragraph seven council communications methods to harass or threaten people to be uh liable to sanctions and i think that 's a that 's a wise uh paragraph to have in there that 's all matter man thank you any other questions or comments on this one councillor doni thank you madam man um just you know reviewing in particular the uh the situation of the casual employee i note from the general manager 's report that our casual load is fairly light it 's about nine employees at nine eight or nine employees out of 80 81 full-time equivalents but i know councillors comment about the domestic domestic and family violence policy that the casuals are entitled to a similar allowance in 10 days if if i just go to page 35 of your report and under sick and carers leave this is that you know the scribbly one um i just note you know a casual employee is entitled to be unavailable to attend work great privilege i 've always thought um or to leave work for up to 48 hours two days per occasion if the employee does not family this leave will be unpaid i 'm just thinking of the position of a long-term casual employee but in terms of sick and carers leave they have um no no protection there whatsoever and i just have some comment on that one first is that correct um through the chair that 's correct so a a somebody who 's been a casual for two or three years would still be entitled to no sick or carers leave um through the chair under the award provisions a casual who 's been in a role that 's that is constant and ongoing he 's entitled to become an employee of council after a period of time so we wouldn 't have a casual who was at two and three year ongoing casual um we would be looking at transitioning if that was the case so once you transition you would then be entitled to the provisions of the award i 'm i think i 'm aware of that i 'm just wondering what 's that times goal is that one year or two years and if they nominate it 's 12 and well-being two questions um how much time would the general manager consider you know availing to an employee under any of these opportunities on a yearly basis and secondly it is completely discretionary is it also discretionary to all classes of employee full-time part-time casual through you mad at me i 'm through the chair it 's it 's two days that 's available for employees to take up health and well-being it 's a provision in the award it 's not a it 's not a a an additional provision that the council offers it 's entirely within the award um and it 's the discretion is at the employee not the employer ah and is it entitled to all classes of employees through the chair or all except casuals thank you madam me thank you any other comments on this one counsellors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 49 councillors item 1303 policy review 1205 contract management and audit update the recommendation is in two parts that report item 13.03 is received as information and part two revised policy 1205 somebody to move that please counselor kellum and the second are second to counsellors thank you councillor callum thank you madam mayor um this is a report which speaks to the standium audit from last year and provides the first tangible uh documentation and actions to respond to that report and the shortcomings that were highlighted in in that particular document we 're really only looking at um the report itself which is for information and the revised policy one two zero five i think the policy is a good start i have provided some um small amendments to uh sharon to um perhaps share with share with the rest of the counselors it 's about making good on some of the um spelling er sorry proofreading errors but also a couple of uh issues about um making a more clear document can you bring that up please all right on the first page there 's one paragraph which i felt was quite um unclear and that was the issue about the legal matters uh i 've also think that we need to put in there a clear statement that 's procurement and disposal policy because they do interact quite regularly although they are on different uh subjects there is a lot of common ground and on page two it 's mostly just a couple of issues of um clarity um the relevant documents are of course the contract management procedures uh and the contract management policy is self-referencing and therefore is redundant they 're the only changes i would like to make to the uh the document thank you counselor so so are you proposing to amend we don 't really have to amend the recommendation no can i ask for your secondary if he would agree with those um suggested changes to get some compliance here counselor gibbons yes agree with those changes your group thank you okay counselor callum have you finished with your i have madame okay council gibbons do you wish to speak to the recommendation yeah just a spot recommendation it 's detailed and step in the right direction that 's it thank you thank you other comments counselors please and i can 't see the full screen i 'm sorry lynette thank you um i gave a list of changes um for this through to the general manager and i also booked it in tandem with policy 1206. and the appendix to this policy which is the contract management procedure i 'm had quite a few more comments as people will see i was going to wait till the mark copy word copy came but i decided that once i 'd started that i would do the comments and i 'd go right through i acknowledge as councillor kellum has said that this is a first step in relation to fixing issues from the centium report my concern is that there is a large a considerable amount of inconsistency and accuracies between this document policy 1206 and the appendix 21205 i believe that all three documents should be looked at together because they 're so intertwined and interrelated the comments i have i can go through madame mayor if you would like there were quite a number on 1205 which were a bit more they dealt with some of the areas that council kellum has already just spoken on but they dealt with all three policies the two policies and the procedure should all be looked at together it is a suite of documents they are crucial to getting it right now this this is not an operational matter we are looking strategically as a council as councillors at having appropriate policies and procedures in place we can 't have policies and procedures in place that contradict each other or that are inconsistent with each other or that are actually incorrect my suggestion is that the recommendation is changed to defer approval of this policy 1205 and that all three documents be looked at in tandem and be looked at together so that we actually have a proper suite of documents to deal with contract management and and we also have a purchasing and disposal and if you look at the breadth of the comments that i have provided i have sent them to all councillors i sent them to the executive management you will see that there are a number of issues that go right across the whole concept one of them is in fact legally what contract are we offering up purchasing more than fifty thousand dollars worth they 're interested can we get the amendment up before you start to speak to it uh to see if we can get a second done so your amendment is counsellor that approval of revised policy 1205 be deferred and until the june meeting and the policy 1205 policy 1206 and the appendix to policy 1205 which is the contract management procedure be reviewed to ensure that they 're all consistent and correct so that they can be put up as a suite of documents for approval by council thank you could i see the amendment on the screen please you happy with that how that is worded counselor kevin uh except there 's missing words at the end matter man so that they can be approved together do i have a seconder for this amendment counsellors council on the council mckinney okay we 've got an amendment before us council mckinnon if you 'd like to speak to the amendment adam mayor i 've spoken to it basically um i don 't know if sharon would like to put up the document don 't think that that 's necessary all or available at the moment council i 'm sorry councillors have seen it all councillors have seen a copy of it though well i think the reasoning is set out in that document due to the number of inconsistencies if i can just we start off saying that this the contract management policy starts on the award of the contract when it actually starts before um and there are a whole lot of other areas i 'll just pull it up if i may so that the this policy shouldn 't commence at the commence it should commence before with um at prior to the award of a contract it 's part and parcel of the procurement process and in particular for contracts greater than 50 000. the contract management procedure which is a document which is referred deals with how tenders are evaluated and the requirements of tenerife so that 's obviously prior to the award of a contract um there are a whole hole of areas missing such as key milestones kpis quality expectations not dealt with in the contract management plan being developed um it talks about um key objectives being established after the contract they actually should be established and in place prior to a contract being entered into i think that um for extensions beyond 30 days bearing in mind that 's a month that should be with the general manager 's approval especially for large large contracts not with the relevant director at the moment the relevant director can approve extensions of up to 60 days which is six two months i think that 's too too long to be left with the director the con it talks about the contract specification setting up the management reporting regime the council should have a management reporting regime that requires on all contracts and that should be a pro forma as to how you report there is no reference in this as to how actually practical completion or is achieved or the completion of the contract by the say for instance the delivery of equipment normally it should set out that there should be an inspection taken by a a officer of the council to ensure that practical arrival there 's nothing in it that that is a crucial element in any contracting there 's an error in bullet 14 i believe it should be 50 000 not 250 000 uh the links to the other policies there 's typos police should be policies um and again as councillor callum said there was an incorrect reference there which has been marked up in his version thank you councilwoman that 's my reasoning madam man thank you if if sorry if council does not see its way open to agree to this amendment then i would at least ask that consideration be given to the number of issues i have raised in respect to 125 contract management policy and that contract that procurement and disposal policy 1286 and the contract management procedure be looked at in the next prior to the next meeting in order to have some consistency and the documents can be accurate there is nothing worse within council when we have policies and procedures that contradict each other thank you councillor council mccackney yes valerie um i support um councilman mckinnon 's comments and and his highlighted as one of our um one of our problem areas by the setting report and this is an opportunity we have to make vast improvements in that area and i think because of the interrelation between the two policies and the procedures um councillor mckibben makes some strong points for reviewing them as a set of documents and i think we should take the opportunity to do that and and give ourselves the best chance of making the correct decision here and putting a policy in that is not only workable but strong um for later later on so i support the available thank you councillor callum council callum sorry madame mayor i foreshadow a further amendment to that uh member proposed by um councilman kevin so a foreshadowed amendment will only come into play if the amendment is lost pathetic counselor callum uh yes yes is there any other comments on this one councilman 's counselor johnny thank you madame with reference to um councilman kevin 's um amendment first off is it appropriate that we know the nature of council mccallum 's um foreshadowing well the foreshadowed because it 's foreshadowed right counselor callum do you have any issue with having your amendment your foreshadowed amendment um stated uh no problem with that madam mayor can i just ask the general manager is that correct procedure that 's correct okay thank you my amendment would seek to add a project management policy to that that 's the missing piece the three things you need are a contract management a procurement and disposal management policy and a project management policy they are the three corners of that particular triangle and they all interact they all build on one another and they need to work together to get a a full and complete picture of how you manage the business if you note the first uh report item on the recommended actions refers to a project management framework and that 's the piece we 're missing and if we do them all together um we will achieve the the um the aim we 're after now i note that uh 1206 is due for review anyway by council in august um i think that 's quite possible to have make sure that the inconsistencies uh are ironed out council dhoni still on my point yeah um you know i defer to the greater experience in some of these areas of my august quality but i also look at the volume of detail and amount of work here if we 're looking at um reviewing these comments and adding councillor helen 's additional policy aspect is the june um meeting a fair target for staff and councillors to meet could i ask that through you to the general manager you 're a manager absolutely not madam mayor we won 't make the june meeting with that the idea of this policy is to create a new and robust contract management policy removed from the procurement process um lined with trying to get some clarity around how we do with contractor management as was the intention of the senior report to start with come on note i note some of the um the commentary made by councillor mckibben in regard to comments around the procedure and i 'm more than happy to work with those offline my intention was to create get on with with providing that project a contractor management process in a consistent way um take the point about project management but there won 't be a project management policy put in place by june i can 't see that occur so madame my final comment on my point thank you is that uh i i support using the expertise we have but um council mcgivern may be having something to say um but uh i 'd like to see uh thank you kevin i can see your hand i would like to see a little bit more resource allowed for this that 's all thank you councillor obvious i 'm speaking against the amendment councillors um ultimately uh policy 1205 uh is a strategic direction that we are given giving to our general manager and that is our role as councillors to give strategic direction ultimately it becomes an operational issue then about how the general manager carries out that direction which is the policy 1206 and the appendix i think i understand completely counsellor mckibben 's um concerns the general manager has indicated that he will work he will work um with councillors to do that and they will be back before council in august so i think we need to be very careful here of what is operational and what is strategic and what is the role of a councillor councillor mckibben thank you madame um i also i 'm concerned that we will not achieve this by june so i 'm happy for an amendment to august but i 'll talk to that in a minute i 'm also happy with councillor kellum 's suggested amendment to add project management policy um i would comment madam mayor on the strategic and operational issues as i said initially strategically we are obliged as a council to ensure we have the appropriate policies and procedures in place the implementation of those policies is up to the general manager that is operational um i know that one of the great bugbegs bug bears of local government and the local government solicitor is that a lot of times they have policies and procedures within councils that conflict i was aware of your issue today i did speak to the says was it out of line to have them all looked at together for us to provide input obviously the general manager does the work and and does it and i am very very happy to work with the general manager informally and with anyone else to make sure we have the right policies and procedures in place in this area it 's in everyone 's in everyone 's interest that we do this properly one of the greatest areas that councils can go wrong is in this contracting and project management area as we are all aware we have some very big projects coming up for this council we obviously want to make sure we have it right there are people out in the community and within this council have certain expertise and i think it should be used where possible i am absolutely open to working with the general manager to make sure we get this right it is in all our interests as are all our other councillors i 'm sure i just think it 's more appropriate to do them together so that they gel together is to have a contract management policy in place and then have some sort of issue that may involve local content for instance where there is an issue because one says you we can put up the ten points for local contact one of the other policies or procedures says no that 's not to be considered we need we need consistency and i think what we should be looking is for an excellent suite of documents that serve oberon very well in lieu of and have that conversation with council about how they would like to see those procedures rolled out i said there 's a number of things that i i that the council of kibben has raised that i i could probably comment on and the first being that this contract management policy details contractor management up to a threshold of 150 000 only right we 've put provisions in place as part of the procedures to try and give certainty to councils around what we as an organization are willing to accept and that is the tender threshold currently sits in local government at 250 000 say anything over 150 000 requires a tender in accordance with as4000 so there is some real distinct changes that this policy provides for and i 'm more than happy to work offline in formalizing those procedures but the the only thing that i would comment on in terms of additions to the contract management policy as it sits is that councilman mckibben makes a connection between [Music] local and not local now in the procedure it says it 's not preferred however if you are it needs to be expressly provided for in the document so those things in accordance with the policy provide for that to be to be catered for i 'm not trying to provide a policy that goes against the grain of any other policy that we have the reason why the separation was purely to get that contract management policy in place and that allows them an opportunity to create a procedure underneath that to give our staff direction in how we consistently develop these projects but they are only up to 150 000 so those bigger projects have a a more robust process manager councillor k paul i 'll try to unmute you i 'm not i 'm sitting at lynette 's desk here not working how do i am i in all right what 's your space bar don 't_''_3975.319 used to do is thank you thank you madam mayor um given that the general manager has has um uh undertaken to work offline with councillors to uh to progress this issue i will vote against the motion so that we in the hope that we might then move to councillor kellum 's foreshadowed amendment which includes project management thank you councillors i haven 't got the amendment in front of me because i 've had to move desks i 'm afraid um but there 's no other comment um none right of reply counselor mckibben um thank you madam i 'm not quite sure what you heard and didn 't hear before you were cut off i don 't know what i didn 't hear either sorry um i don 't know what i did maybe if you could tell me what you heard um what i did say madam mary and operational issue and i had consulted local government solicitor and said that i just there is a policy i agree with the general manager in that the policies need to be separate because procurement disposal deals with a lot of different things but there is not an overlap but they have to for some areas they have to be read in tandem they are separate policies but procedure for 1205 is it has to be consistent with the policy and there can 't_''_4098.0 be anything the contract management policy that is at odds with what is in the procurement policy um for instance i can 't and i can 't recall without going through it with all my notes again at one stage it said for instance um there were there were certain uh barriers as to what has to happen and one it said up to 49 999 and another it said from 50 greater than 50 000. so there was some inconsistency in the figures um i i think the policies and the project management policy um do need to be reviewed in some depth um strategically place and are appropriate and i also think that we 're not talking about the implementation of the procedure we 're talking about the actual procedure being correct anyway leaving the idiosyncrasies of what 's strategic and what 's operational um on the side at the moment i think that we have all indicated that we are willing to we want to not willing we want to work with the general manager to make sure that we have a three robust policies contract management project management procurement and disposal and we also have a robust um contract management procedure which is an edema to the policy thank you i 've suggested a way to do that i think june is too short i agree with everyone it probably needs to be august um i agree with councillor kellum 's amendment for shout out to member for shout out amendment apologies thank you councillor councillor lyon council lion brenda okay got you now can you hear me yes i can can you hear me yeah i can hear you my reception this evening is uh i can 't see me either most of what 's been said in the last 10 minutes right um people 's voices are cutting in and out and i 've lost most of the pictures and my computer 's telling me that it 's it 's poor thank you thank you counselor sharon could i ask that you bring the amendment back up on the screen me while i 'll go back to my own desk thank you two where 's the mute right you 're ready to go okay councillors i 'm now going to put the amendment that the approval of revised policy 1205 be deferred until the june meeting and that policy 1205 policy 1206 and appendix to 1.205 contract management procedure be reviewed to ensure they are all consistent and correct so that they can be approved together all in favor i need to see the screen i 'm sorry councilwoman kepney councillor lion council mckibben against one two three four five the amendment 's lost we now go back to the original motion so we 'll go to the push our animation that foreshadowed motion metadata yeah yep yep i 'm up the motion please just in response while sharon 's doing that council line i believe everybody know bronze had some quite dire nbn issues today council kellum would you like to put your amendment please okay um all right what i want what i what wanted to be what i want madam mayor is uh that we refer policy 1205 contract management and 1206 procurement and disposal to the august ordinary council meeting and that the contract management procedures be returned to the general manager and the interested counsellors to work with him to ensure consistency and that a project management policy also be provided at the august meeting is that it are you happy with that counselor counselor callum yeah uh the projects yeah just uh in the first line after disposal deferred to the august meeting happy with that yes happy with that do i have a second order to the amendment councillors councillor gibbons do you wish to speak further to the amendment um councillor kellum um only to say that i think that this has been a a very fruitful discussion um to arrive at very well for all concerned thank you councillor gibbons yes through the chair same here a great discussion amongst the councillors and management and it 's a works in progress so if we don 't rush it we 'll get it right and [Music] it was a great discussion thank you councillor mckibben um thank you madame i would i support the uh council kellum 's amendment the only thing i 'm not quite sure on is the word uh about the procedure being and returned to the general manager um i would have thought it should say something like and um councils will work with the general manager in for on an info full basis uh on the procedure or something like that i just don 't think the words and return are correct counselor callum i 'm happy for um that to be amended to um what was it you said uh council mckinnon well i i i just think and and and councils will work informally with the general manager on 1205 appendix being the contract management procedure are you happy with that counselor callum i 'm into in one moment counselor dona you wish to speak uh only on the motion madam now i 'm uncomfortable i 'm sorry could you repeat that counselor danny uh the point where it says that counselors will work with him i think him is inappropriate it should be uh the position title general manager yep yes happy with that counselor thank you councillor dhoni anyone else speaking on these counsellors i 'll ask the executive assistant to bring up the amendment on the screen so we can vote i 'm going to put the amendment councillors that policy 1205 contract management and 1206 procurement and disposal disposal be deferred to the august meeting and that councillors work informally with the general manager in relation to the contract management procedure further that a project management policy also be provided at the august meeting all in favor councillors against emotions against council line would you like your name recorded yes oh you 're on youtube yes sorry you 're delayed okay that 's courage unanimously counsellors thank you work andrew the amendment now becomes a motion all in favor of the thank you motion is now carried thank you now move on councillors page 91 councillors item 1401 monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have somebody to move that way please counselor callum in a second to please council mckibben thank you councillor kellum uh thank you madam mayor uh i just have one question that 's on the um uh the road audit and the timing for the steering committee to review the draft document and for councils in general to see the document we 're on page 94 councillors second item down is that correct councillor uh that 's correct yep i threw it through the chair it 's proposed for a steering committee meeting next tuesday we 'll leave the document after a review from the steering committee for the terms of reference thank you general andrew thank you councillor callum yes it is man councilman mckibben councilman kevin um thank you madam mayor um sorry am i yes am i on yep sorry um think about it i asked several questions of the general manager the record to the extent that um they 're of a general nature and don 't have any confidential implications so i don 't know if they should be asked by me or whether um they should just um um be added i can ask them if you like madam ma 'am um i would ask you to be aware of confidentiality counseling so i will put it in this frame and page 9293 item 32 21 0519 the ground of 4.25 million was unsuccessful so as i understand it oberon currently has 2 million state government which i think the general manager has indicated to me that is correct um borg 's obviously in kind work um uh you 're bordering intervention sorry you 're bordering into confidential counsellor i understand that and we are looking fork 's contribution is at this point in time commercial confidence i wasn 't aware that madam mayor i thought it been mentioned previously and we are looking at other other grants elsewhere at this time to make up the short form that 's correct correct and the da at this stage has chair it was there will be a limited opportunity for consultation is that is that the situation any idea when it will be lodged so so through the chair the the issues that we see is that under the current covert provisions it doesn 't um allow for robust consultation which we 've indicated that we would do so we 've looked at trying to delay that until such times as we 're in a position to be able to go down a consultation path that 's a little bit more robust than than just putting on exhibition thank you i i know um the next item is page 94 which has already been asked by councillor kellum and it 's the schedule wrote audit um working parties to meet next week uh that 's all i had respect to the general manager madam man thank you council mckibben any other comments on this one councillors councillor downey thank taking into account the extraordinary circumstances at the moment there 's um one position has just been recently filled of the director of planning but we 've got about it um on ten percent to uh to nine percent vacancies uh you know there 's seven positions there unfilled um only that it just makes me stop and think and look about it it means that somebody 's picking up a lot of work to cover those and it also makes me wonder um how we 're going with filling that position those positions notwithstanding that the um the business recovery says they 'll begin processes in may that 's just it 's just down a lot of numbers so i suppose i 'm just asking for a general comment through you from the general manager madam there is there any significance that we 've got you know seven or eight positions um available in the workforce of 81. the general manager through the chair thank you councillor the recruitment phase has purely been delayed because of our current situation under the covered 19 restrictions now i 'm going to be pretty really obvious to go down the recruitment path and they 're not going to engage anyone until prescriptions either ease or we can get back to some type of the current restrictions we have deployed some people into different areas around the place so they take up um work that was otherwise earmarked for some of these positions the other there is a there is one person there that has um we 've had issues with recruitment and we 're looking at those options around that um the road audit for the survey and design engineer is exactly the reason why we don 't go down that path of recruiting for recruiting sake we 're going down the path of appropriate recruiting in the appropriate areas so yeah like the number of positions are uh there to give council an indication on why and where where we are down on numbers but a number of positions have been redeployed to cater for that shortfall during the covet pandemic thank you madame thank you counselor johnny is there any other queries or questions on this council mccarthy yes um with a report on the road management i i was interviewed by timothy mccarthy and i was very alarmed to see that he hadn 't been out and seen the meadows road works um i i thought that would have been a priority if he 's to go and have a look at those sort of projects any comment general manager i 'm happy to let the technical service director give an indication on what sites that the consultant went to uh yeah thanks mr general manager um through the chair uh yes certainly uh morrison low did go out to meadows road they also went to hazel grove road and been across a number of projects through the shire in their assessment so yeah they they did certainly attend meadows road um council mccarthy mccarthy when i spoke to the timothy mccarthy and had the interview on the phone he had not attended that road uh through the chair the the concern was raised in the standard of uh road that was constructed and that 's uh certainly a point of discussion we had with morrison lowe in respect to to meadows right so i can confirm that definitely was the case thank you thank you mccarthy through the chair um as part of the road audit um steering committee question to um tim mccarthy he 's the guy who did the who did those works and i 'm always of the understanding that he absolutely did go to the meadows road so um whether there 's some miscommunication there but i 'm more than happy and and i think uh council mccarthy sits on that road audit committee to have that conversation with him thank you councillor gibbons and then councillor kevin i just read the check clarification that it will be a meeting up at the council next week um through the chair if social distancing allows for it then we will certainly look at that otherwise i 'm mindful of people on the committee and distance as they are away we might have to zoom a couple of people in there to do that i just think it 's it 's time we can try and get some of these meetings with smaller gatherings up at the council zoom 's not suiting too many of us or some of us but anyhow we 'll see what happens next week more than happy to take that on board the social distancing rules we are no different to anybody else unfortunately that 'd be right but i think there 'd be less than 10 people at the meeting okay we 'll leave that with the general manager council mckibben um thinking about it i think the general manager dealt with the majority of it so why not raises the working party meeting next week council mccarthy 's issue about the meadows road um and i too i probably agree with the council given gibbons and that um i think for this coming working party meeting it would be an advantage if we could have it in person it is it will be under 10 people um and i think it would be it would be good if we could have that meeting uh in the council chambers with appropriate social distancing it may have to obviously be in the main chambers which allows more distance thank you councilman kevin we 'll leave that one with the general manager is there any other comments here on this report i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor carry thank the recommendation is there that the report item be received as information can i have somebody to move that way please counsel mckibben and a second applies a second account council mccarthy thank you council mckibben um thank you madame the report speaks for itself um i commend the recommendation thank you councillor council mccarthy pretty straightforward madam mayor um i think it 's about time we 've done something with the first item the dog off police area but um anyway we 'll see what happens with our new director thank you now the comments on this one counselors put the recommendation all in favor thank you carried page 113 counselors item 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have a mover please council gibbons and a second of place council mckibben council gibbons yes through the chair had some very good reports on the al-shutters hill road and the the limbing that 's taken place out there it took a while to happen but it 's happened and other roads are getting the same treatment and this that there 's been some very good reports thank you counselor that 's it for the moment thank you for you thank you councilman cuban um thank you man madame um yes i 'll just read the questions i asked the technical services director which have been replied to i think by the technical services director or the general manager the stp steering committee meeting is being set up for tuesday the 29th of may as i understand and a time to be determined um the the sewer logging data has as i understand it being completed um further testing has highlighted hydraulic loading however part of organic loading further testing was required for additional organics which is to be completed in june so i 'm assuming the testing hasn 't been completed will be completed in june is that right technical services director so we won 't have the final results by the meeting on the 29th of may uh through the chair most likely not there is some additional testing that is being discussed with um our consultants on h2o and that 's also as part of discussions be in a position to finalize our submission to [Music] um with the steering committee on the 29th of may it will have to be subsequent to that when we 'll have all the coherent information to go into that report to deep dpie is that correct uh look at this stage it 's really dependent on those test results being available but uh we we are anticipating to do our best to have those results if if not then it 'll be the latter as you suggest so there 's a possibility we can have them by the 29th of may we 're working toward that um counselor yes sorry sorry it was just i wasn 't quite sure all right um that 's all from me madam mayor and i commend the report as a second thank you is there any other comment on this one councillors council mccarthy yes through you madame could we get an update on what happened on wednesday the 8th on the casaray highway works that was contract works that we 've undertaken through the chair the the matter is being worked through the general manager as soon as i since i have that determined okay thank you now the comments on this one counsellors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 121 item 1404 monthly activity report corporate services the recommendation is there that the report is received as information can i have someone to move this please councillor kellerman a second of please council mckibben councillor kellum uh thank you madam here good report um i just want to confirm that uh the um covered 19 update which is one of your action items uh corporate services um we the resolution was to defer the 7.5 percent interest rate being charged on overdue rates for the duration of the pandemic because there seems to be a bit of misinformation in the community on this issue within the community councillor yes right um we have put that out there i recall the resolution but it 's been reported otherwise in the community and i 'm a bit concerned about that right to the director uh through madam chair uh yes that is correct um the resolution was for a period of six months and the um i have spoken to one business who is applying for that at this current time have you heard of misinformation being into the community um no i had a discussion with my rates office over the last couple of days and we have not had anything said to us about it thank you maybe we 'll address that with a further release counsellor yes that 's all madam matt thank you is there any other councilman kevin did you have something um i have madame i just made a mirror i 've just lost my document somehow but anyway um first i think the the first one was in relation to i 'm sorry i 've as i said i 've lost my questions um in relation to the audit um the auditors requested further information in relation to the decision on on investments um i have the audit the audit as i understand don 't want any further information from that that i provided in that paper to you um director of corporate services [Music] sorry i 'll just close they have the information that they require and um we will bring that back to council um um and i 'm just trying to find the other one as i said i 've logged in data maybe is it logging data yes the one was yes you were going to update us on the issue with civica and uh the problems with uh microsoft 365 etc yep um through the may i do have the questions in front of me um councilman kevin if that helps you um yes the um the comment on the delay with civica has been resolved if there was a slight delay but um that matter has been resolved you also asked me a question regarding um issue involving the delaying of the rates notices for a month as part of late a recommendation later in the business paper yes and i can confirm that there is um there is no impact on that and and i will discuss it when we get to that report uh the other question for me was about borrow box yes i think you answered that that we 've have thank you councilman is there any other questions or queries on this report councillors council mccarthy um this is just some information i require for later um when the pcyc took over management of the swimming pool uh they took over uh payment of the electricity accounts things like that didn 't they through the general manager um yet my understanding is that 's the case we 'll um get back to the reply to that question appropriately so we don 't know thank you thank you council mccarthy is any other questions counselor capal thank you thank you madam mayor um yeah just um for interest about in the information technology section the internet of things i 'm fascinated by parking sensors bin sensors it all sounds like a great idea are they installed is it working and the people counter camera outside the toilets uh will that involve facial technology facial recognition technology through the general manager i 'm happy for happy for the direct corporate services director um so um through the metamed council i can let you know that uh yes those sensors have been trial and i need to advise that the camera is not actually a camera is just a counter of people going in and out it 's not taking any visual photos thank you thank you council capable is there any other comments on this one councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 129 councillors item 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is there that council received this reporter 's information can i have someone to move that way please counselors council mccarthy council mckinney thank you council mccarthy pretty straightforward in this environment thank you council mckinney no nothing to add it 's um pretty straightforward report thank you thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 132 item 1406 grants monthly update the recommendation is there that report is received as information a mover please councilman kibben in a second to place council callum councilman mckibben uh thank you madame a extensive report um in detail um page 132 library grant from the new south indicated previously um for the council to update our library and obviously um the initial grant and application was 4.115 million um we 've obtained 3 million from the new south wales government and we allocated 385 for the minor upgrade uh previously from our own council resources and we 've received 100k from the federal government my question is and i know the general manager touched it on it i think on page 94 is i think that leaves us a shortfall of 630 000 so what are we what avenues are we looking at to fund that shortfall sorry page 92 of the general manager 's report but uh are there any grant opportunities out there or any thoughts from the council staff through the general manager through the a lot of grant opportunities at this point in time we 'll still look to do that i 'm interested in trying to look at what options were available to us through some type of revised scope to see whether we can still meet the requirements of the of the um of the project within that budget so as those um and report back to council and we 've got a better scoping of the of those requirements thank you thank you um customer kevin you finished um the other thing i just wanted to check was page 134 which is deals with the spartan defend i think we um we were seeking two grands for spartan 50 000 for the from the stronger community country communities round three and thirty thousand from the drought fund um i understand we weren 't successful with fifty thousand um but it looks as though we 've obtained 30 000 from the bushfire community resilience and economic fund um so i assume therefore there 's about a 20 and i think that in general manager 's interest there 's about a 20 000 uh short for which will have to be budgeted for in 2020 21 in our accounts is that correct uh through your madame air to either the general manager or the director of um of corporate services i 'm happy to take this one madam mayor through the chair that 's that 's basically what we 'll be looking yeah i support the recommendation thank you councilman kevin is there any other questions on this one councillors we 're putting the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you [Applause] page 137 councillors item 1407 water usage drought assistance the recommendation is that the report is received and noted can i have somebody to move that please counselor capall and councillor callum thank you councillor cable thank you thank you thank you thank you madam mayor it 's good to see the um um the drought assistance water dropping to the level that it has um although interesting also to uh to see that uh some still quite large amounts of water going out the three of them two of them are quite substantial um just a comprehensive report that 's all i needed to say thank you thank you councilwork council kellum nothing to add madam mayor thank you any other comments on this one councillors with the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 138 item 1408 water and sewer plant report the recommendation is there that the report be received as information and move the police it 's through the chair just a straightforward report that 's it thank you thank you councillor councillor callum happy with the report madam mayor thank you any other comments counsellors putting the recommendation all in favor carrick thank you [Applause] page 140 item 1409 operational plan deferral there 's a recommendation there that the report is received and noted can i have some somebody to move that please counselor dhoni is that you yes that 's fine yes madame and councillor kellum thank you councillor dhoni uh i think this is a reasonable decision madam man i think it speaks for itself thank you councillor councillor callum uh this simply brings uh to our attention the the changes in legislation and the deferral of certain milestones in our planning and reporting requirements thank you councillor any other comments on this one 's counsellors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carried thank you we have one late report counselors item 14 10 2019 23rd quarter budget review statement there 's a recommendation that the report is received as information can i have a counsellor to move back please kellum and a second applause council mckibben thank you councillor kellum uh thank you madam mayor um for the update reflects some of the extra expansion we 've had and hence a slight deterioration in our overall anticipated budget outcome but there are a number of issues we 'll probably mitigate that in the last quarter of the financial year for example the uh extra road works that we 've been come our way and also some other issues improving that particular revenue stream tell the story and i 'm quite happy that we 're still in a reasonable position it 's a really relatively small deficit uh and it 's manageable thank you councillor councilmember kibben um thank you madame yes um absolutely reasonable that we have an update at this time as a result of the covert 19 situation and we know where we are or what we 're facing um it is not ideal that we 're facing a deficit um in the current situations but um that 's where we are at the moment um i did suggest to the director of corporate services a slight i think required some correcting um quarter three um i think it should say quarter three has seen council make headway into road cap into road capital works projects which currently sits at a 90 percent of the budget there 's just a few errors in the typos there thank you councillor just be good to when when it 's on that when they that report is on the record that it 's just slightly amended it 's just one sentence the rest of it is fine i 'm sure that will be gone thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors councillor dhoni thank um i think we you know need to monitor this closely but i um do not feel yet that uh that size deficit is a serious problem for the council i just had a couple of questions you know though um for example um on page two uh fourth paragraph under summary it says there are increased expenses in the general fund relating to um and i sort of feel there 's some influence that these things are affecting the deficit purchase of my understanding that though i been able to get clarity on it for some time is that there was at least 90 000 and should have been more sitting in the land bank allocated to the potential by the column so assuming that money 's drawn down can i just have it clarified that that would have contributed to the deficit in no way whatsoever it would have simply been expending money from the land bank can i just have that clarified please um through the chair uh council johnny yes that is correct um what we 've tried to do is uh give an overview of some of the increased expenses it didn 't necessarily mean that any of those individual ones were the cause of the negative effect it was just an overall summary and again madame in the bottom of page three where we 're talking about expense 388 000 from the town improvement fund this too should have made no difference whatsoever to the deficit but it would have been the expenditure of reserves and funds that we have sitting in town improvement i just seek anybody 's uh misunderstanding of those money being spent from town improvement or towards the o 'connell recreation ground contributing to deficits at all can i just have that clarified on that last one as well the town improvement fund through the chair madam chair yes that is correct uh councillor danny uh the bottom of page three is simply stating that council has expended money that was allocated in town improvements levy that 's it for the moment thanks madam mayor thank you if i could madame make just one statement on page three um there was a miscommunication between myself and the technical services director and i have um underwater fund capital works put there that it would um is on track for completion during the current financial year this year should actually say current um current calendar year my apologies for that thank you any other comments here counselors on this report i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 141 item 15 there is no urgent business this evening page 141 item 16 closed session confidential reports [Music] development director will wave his hand um he replaces uh bruce mcdonald who 's been acting in that in that role now for um the last or since january this year i just want to take the opportunity to thank bruce and welcome paul before we enter into um closed session and the bracket general regulation 2005. in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kind as referred to in section 10a bracket 2 of the act and should be dealt with in part of the meeting close to the media and the public i 'd like to thank the members of the public for joining us this evening in our zoo meeting and a second of please council all in favor carrick

both past and present i 'm just checking the audio now microphone pastor joe would you care for him well father god we thank you so much first and foremost this beautiful part of the country that we get to call home and father i thank you for each and every one of our councillors and our men uh thank you for their willingness to lead our community father to the best of their ability and so father we ask tonight for your wisdom and your guidance may you guide our conversations and give us wisdom in the deliberations and the decisions that are made we thank you thank you that you will god and direct us in jesus name we pray amen amen amen [Music] there is uh there are no leave absence and um both councilman kevin and director of technical services are joining this meeting by zoom are there

allocated all questions and comments must be directed through the mayor and in and in the instance of a question if it cannot be given within a reasonable period of time this is the only opportunity for a community member to address council during an ordinary meeting is there anyone who has a question robin robin some of you aware somehow i 've been fun but i 've always i 've taken up interest in the recreation ground um since we 've lived across the road and i want to thank council for the grant stand and also putting up the basketball hoops for the kids and for young adults because um i 've noticed there 's at least two different groups of men young men who actually play basketball over there and from the beginning i did point out once before when i had asked about the basketball courts uh what are they called stands anyway uh i did mention that the ground there were holes still in the concrete and my concern is is that they place very robustly and um my concern is that if one of them fall there council will be hit with a probably a sew of some kind because it 's not a level flying area um as it is the rain it needs a wall on the other side of the footpath to stop the runoff of the mud that continually comes down if we don 't put up because i don 't really think a a sheet at the back you know a wall across the back is going to be of any great use as far as the mud that flow follows through and you can 't sit there after there 's been rain of any consequence i 'd also ask because the cricket pictures are being used if it 's possible if when they 've been filling roads if they 've got a bit left over to fix the picture because when people play with the balls there sometimes they 'll shoot off that 's what i would just like to mention but i 'd like to see that the pictures sort of tied in okay thank you thank you very much [Music] anyone else 's questions my name is uh cervic and i 'm speaking for myself i just wanted to make accomplish the hub the best outcome in my view would addition to all else it would free up council to consider more relevant issues if the council must go down the road to try to salvage some part of the project by having a one-month discussion with the tenderer with the least worst tender i suggest that it needs to look at ways to cutting back on hub size and complexity the joining together of the roofer and the new construction and the library is complex and in part due to the ground level of the uber being higher than the library and the new build it has negative cost throw-on effects across the whole project solution is to leave the hoop freestanding as it is and do a more modest extension of the existing library the 200 250 seat auditorium should be eliminated altogether it is not needed andrew will compete with the rsl and the uh the gimbal of the malachi gilmour councillors should ensure that proper costings are produced for their consideration including explicitly stated costing assumptions and clearly expected contingencies finally when the costing in the sign is the hand and the four council takes a the community understands all design and cost issues and the associated financial risks and can give its feedback to canvas anymore questions thank you for those questions and uh we 'll move on to the body of the meeting the first item is item eight and that is confirmation of minutes thank you pastor joe move it a second andrew uh councilman councillor tucker councilman kevin [Music] thank you mr mayor i 'm very happy to move the recommendation to the 11th of february 2022 be accepted by this council is a true record of that meeting thank you councilman council tucker um i agree i think councilman said eleventh that uh sorry it was the wrong date yes apologies and report can i have a second please counselor i won 't speak with maya in a minute some really good things that we 've seen happening for grant the um the stronger communities round three grant building youth all the noble and second guard 's existence i think that 's a that 's a great project all in all um a busy business time all right any other uh thank you mr mayor yes i i agree with uh council trembles a very busy month if i could ask a couple of questions and they relate to page eight the meeting with the manager of the oberon correctional service center i think it was justin quinn and there was some i think appointment of a new security officer read the memorandum of understanding can you update us as to whether there is any progress on the memorandum of understanding and where we stand with the memorandum of understanding the memorandum of understanding uh lapsed this essentially the previous two years yes for all sorts of reasons but mostly to do with the correction centre and their ability to uh have anyone interact with with the inmates and the staff the correction centre is very keen to move it forward as we are and they are coming back with um any additions or alterations to the the draft mau that may be necessary noting the two years of hiatus and we will be signing it as soon as we get that and have our own look at the document and few weeks and if i could follow that with a question on the page nine at the top the meeting with the or no sorry the correspondence i think it was from chris taylor regional general manager um tpg has is a competitor of telstra so i i i assume that tpg is using telstra 's infrastructure in regional new south wales to expand their amber is that what does that mean correct um it suits tpg um and i 'm sure it suits telstra because they 're probably getting a fair amount of um cash out of that particular deal and noting the last uh issue on that same page the um letter from orange community broadcasters um do we see that as a further opportunity to promote oberon further afield in orange in particular through that opportunity we haven 't responded to them uh just yet but that is certainly in my mind i 'm not sure how how effective it will be depends on how much air time we get but we will be exploring options to to cooperate with it thank you mr man any further because you 'll see presents for as information passed this is a notice of motion from councillor tucker and the motion is that the group that a report be provided to the next works committee meeting about the proposed upgrading of the fish river crossing at noon hill road including the design of the crossing including proposed culvert size and any measure to prevent blockage or damage to the crossing from debris an analysis of the frequency at which the river can be expected to over top the upgrades upgraded crossing and the estimated cost of the project traditionally the person who puts the notification up moves it sorry cancel and counsel still learning i hope that 's reasonably straightforward what i 'm getting at that that i think it is worth going through the process before construction commences just to have a look at what outcome will be achieved in terms of particularly in the second point how often we could expect that also to be at the top um and and through the chair to the general manager um can i confirm that this was a resolution of yeah the noon until culvert um repair was approved by a council meeting before [Music] um through the chair it 's always a council 's discretion to discuss any of these matters however um any any resolution of council from this nature will need to either be superseded or or the previous report rescinded on the basis of how it was approved in september last year so if we go down this road that means that previous decisions could be brought to the table again unless we just move onto this as this decision was made so through the chair there 's always an opportunity for cancer to bring back reports through a number of processes that that relate to the code and what that allows you to do um in this instance a project was approved by council to restore an existing colon and that 's what council staff have been have been preparing the work for if further work is reported as part of this it would be council decision to do so but it 's something that we would need to stop and have a look so 's just that a decision was made was made by the previous council based on a recommendation from the technical director and his teams and their expertise is what we rely on even now ourselves and so with previous council so i think that we should just move on from this and concentrate on the bigger issues councilman kevin um sorry mr mr mayor i 'd just like to make a couple of points first of all um the second of emotion usually supports it doesn 't speak against it number one and number two is i 'm i i know from the actions report the current status of that resolution is not um it was basically the replacement of the causeway it wasn 't um to replace the existing causeway it was a replacement and funded for 80 000 um because it 's now going to be a concrete juncture utilizing two priests concrete box cells with a concrete overlay surface and it 's currently subject to seek having approval from the new south wales fisheries to the design so bearing those issues in mind i 'm not sure it is basically not saying don 't proceed with that notice of motion it is just saying we want a report if there 's any clarification needed maybe we should ask add a point to the notice of motion to say the project as endorsed on 21st september 2021 not proceed until the investigations requested this notification have been provided and the report received from new south wales fisheries is obtained um i noticed technically we probably haven 't got a second or if the second was spoken against it um and i 'm probably proposing alluding to an amendment so i probably shouldn 't be um seconding seconding it but i 'll leave that to those much more skilled in the meeting process than me well it 's already been seconded the fact that the sickness is unusual but not unheard of right okay well can i uh if you 're anyone else who wants to speak because councillor mckinnon 's already had a attack i 'll come back to you councilman kevin um yeah mr mayor i just would like some technical assistance here to understand the the project correct but we have more accurate information is that incorrect i 'm through the chair that that 's that 's correct so the the way that the noonan 's hill replacement occurred was a replacement of an existing bridge sorry the replacement of existing culvert and that and that culvert has been designed in accordance with the recommendation that 's been provided to council i 've been provided by council my understanding about this no summation would be that the hot the idea of finding out or doing hydrological assessment on the bridge would give an indication of well if you if you make it bigger you 'll be able to [Music] support more increased flows or increase flows of water and that will no doubt delay the program because it will require a council resolution again on top of the one that you 've already provided to staff make sense anyone else [Music] one is i think the motion is relevant because it also gives us some information that we really need to know and even though it 's been costly before it was costed um on the um take pipes they wanted boxed carpets on the council for eight thousand dollars which council approved now we we 've already had audits to say that our project management needs improving so i think if we do these steps that are outlined in the you know summation we 're improving those methods that we do these projects every how small we are i know it 's only 80 000. it 's 80 000. that we could spend somewhere else because we didn 't have to spend i 'm not saying this will be 80 cows but we need to be sure we need to get those processes in place even if they are for smaller projects and i think council have a need to know and i think the rate players need to know so i support council attack information the other thing is the resolution in the 25th of september um is not clear on whether it 's replacing the political light it was clear that what was there wasn 't up to the standard that 's required so you wouldn 't_:_1574.4 and any of their concepts could 't think there 's an issue there with council saying they 'll repair striving for better standards so i think um council attack as well within his rights to ask for that information and i think councilman too yeah um i 'm not against uh councilman tucker 's request and and i don 't think it stops the process of the thing or all it is is um he 's asking that say if the two pipes that are there for a certain size they might that 600 meters of flow through but these culverts they might let 1200 through and and that 's all i think he 's asking which you can 't determine the amount of water going down there because it all depends on that dam whether it 's full or not and and i i think he 's just asking for that volume that it improves and if you have a look at the um crossing down there it 's cracked in the middle so you would you 're gonna have to repair the whole lot it was prepared probably about 35 40 years ago when i just think the request is to um just tell us what i put the culverts in cameras has improved the flavor that 's all that 's the way i see it and the estimated cost of the project well it 's still good is it 80 000 or 88 000 anyways still got the money there that could go ahead i don 't think this is going to stop it does it i 'm through the chair i think that exactly stops it because the whole intention of the hydrological report is that well we already know that we 're putting pipes in that are greater in capacity than what the ones that were there before we understand that so to answer your question it is going to have a better hydrological analysis i don 't need it but this this motion asks council to undertake an assessment to get an understanding about heights and making sure that we 've got enough clear fall between the the river and the the running board and council tucker will correct me if i 'm wrong in my analysis of what he might reduce that again what i 'm saying is that council staff have been acting on a resolution made by council that replaces the existing culvert we 've put improvements into the culverts where where we can where we know that we need better flows the council wants to do an analysis on that from a professional engineer then that 's what we 'll do if that 's what you require but it 's going to have an impact on whether this project can proceed as quick as the approval for a fischer 's permaculture i just i can 't see here where the report requires the culverts to be changed all he 's doing is asking for that what chains it 'll do to flow in the river as far as i can see and that 's like there 's two parts there here yeah the 450s i don 't know the size of coal but so they weren 't in the report but does that give us twice the flow and that 's all i 'm happy with that i don 't want to see the um estimated also knows that chris wants to input in them and andrew does but yeah let me ask for what it 's going to achieve that 's all it 's just a matter of numbers the way i see it councilman um thank you mr man can i ask through you uh several questions through you probably the general manager to the technical services director um what is the increased size of the proposed box section culverts to be installed uh how much bigger are they than the body exists um although a hydrological survey has not been done the technical services should must have some indication as to how much more water these are likely to take through them you must have a preliminary design and that design must be based on meeting certain flood levels over that causeway so could i ask the technical services director who is online provide us with some update information yeah through the chair thanks councilman mckibben just give a bit of an oversight and quite quickly stated the original report wasn 't the basis of the defects uh to the existing low-level causeway wide culverts uh joined there 's six cells in total which gives us a quite a broader area which obviously fisheries look favorably at when you uh are putting new structures in in in in tributaries and alike so on that basis it would be elevated not a great deal on the existing structure but understanding the hydrological behavior there whilst i don 't have a definite hydrological study undertaken we know that certain points where it commonly elevates two on the banks and yes undoubtedly would still over top at certain times of high level flows however it would be certainly an improvement on what currently exists with the the pipes under the the low level low level causeway at the minute so the six box culverts in total uh the total structure would be seven to seven point two meters wide uh uh uh should wide for a dual car uh use and when you look cross-sectionally added it would be two point two point four meters wide to allow more water to underpass the actual bridge structure in itself so we actually have gone down the process at the minute uh just pending on that fisheries approval to proceed with that and again pending the uh watercourse in receding waters uh given the recent reigns sorry thank you uh mr mayor um just a couple of issues uh i understand it 's 7.2 meters wide but you referenced 2.4 metres somewhere there and i wasn 't quite clear as to what that related to because if you say it 's two cars wide that means it 's at least got to be six meters to seven meters wide across that way and i didn 't understand how many pipes are currently there now and what their size is and what their area and how much we 're increasing by you must know what 's there existing uh what the diameter of those pipes are as compared to what we 're putting in and i think you indicated that we 're going to make it wider than what exists how much wider and how much higher yeah through the chair yeah certainly the pipes there i i don 't recollect just off the top of my head the being 2.4 metres wide and one point too high is substantially and cross-sectionally uh a lot more water flow that would underpass the new structure as opposed to the existing so um i don 't i don 't have that other information in front of me at the minute on those pipes uh pipe pipe cells under that existing crossing sorry mr mayor i 'm a bit surprised about this this notice of motion has been on the books for at least a week i would have thought this information should be at the technical services director 's fingertips through the chair just in response to that query is this notification seeks for a report to be provided for future works given yes not to have it on here now all right i am i 'm just i i think this motion is substantially unnecessary the design of the crossing is available at the moment i understand we understand what the design of the new crossing is going to be chris has just indeed it will have substantially more uh ability to deal with flood water it is basically a similar but more modern capability i have no information here as to what an analysis of hydrological analysis of that particular river and that particular crossing would cost or how long it would take or what it may reveal we have a lot of experience in this council with the flood floods that occur on that road and we understand pretty clearly what it takes for it to be made impossible it would appear that the culverts that we are getting will have a combined width of 7.2 meter of space within which that water could flow and it will be at the higher level as well so i think all the issues except the hydrological issue are available within council at the moment and frankly i think the risk which would be reduced by any hydrological survey would be very much in the margins and that 's why i think this is an unnecessary motion now you have a rotary plate thank you mr mayor and i apologize i didn 't speak very well to explain what was behind this motion when i spoke previously um let 's assume a year i don 't know how often but they are after a small pipe so uh there would be quite a few occasions when it goes underwater and people coming along wanting to cross would have to go back and around the wrong way what i would like to find out is after this upgrade happens by how much will that frequency be reduced so for example if we were to find that with the proposed size of culvert um it 's the crossing still goes underwater a couple of times a year i can see residents and ratepayers who go along that road saying well we just spent all that money upgrading it why didn 't we go to the trouble of of working out what size was needed to get that frequency down to an acceptable level now a study may not show that it may show that the proposed size will uh will handle nearly all flows and it might only go underwater once every large number of years that 's fine but at the moment we don 't know uh and and just to explain the sizes i think the 7.2 meters is the road width in other words the length of the conf i think the the actual internal culvert size is 2.4 meters 2 by 1.2 if i understood correctly so um but uh yeah anyway that 's why i feel just worth going through the process of doing an analysis which is not a big job before the construction commences so what does that analysis what cost does that incur not not very much it 's not a very big task i would have thought it could be done in house but if not it is a relatively small project for a consultant to to look at the catchment come up with typical frequencies of certain flows and uh how often that flow would exceed the post profit size through through the chair we wouldn 't have data on how many times that the new and civil crossing goes across that i was guessing that i think it would be a number of times a year oh absolutely but water going across a culvert and people are being able to access across first thing that i 'll andre so there are a number of things there that we would need to be we need to consider as part of doing this assessment that 's that 's why we 've yeah he 's had writer reply yeah that means the motion gets put well okay so i am now putting the motion that uh the report be provided as outlined on titan 1001. all in favor against was it all hand up i was in fact you 're in favor so what 's that i couldn 't see against this sort of six three six three questions can you put your hands up again for those in favor one two three four against one two three four and you 're five and andrew kevin you 're against yes the motion is lost so moving on to item 1101 central new south wales joint organisation board meeting recommendation is councilmate the report from the recent central new south wales during organisation board meeting and providing response to the central west and arana transport plan including the planned ward 2 news population planning assumptions that a longer-term delivery of a safe swift link between sydney and the central west of new south wales do i have a move in a second council haydn sorry can you put your hand up please andrew 's moving it okay councilman gibbon um thank you mr mayor um i 'm very pleased to be able to move this recommendation um and in moving it i would congratulate the mayor in being appointed the deputy chair of the central west joint organization i think that puts over on very good stead to have a very good person to promote our position on that joint organization and i also know the mayor of cabon and kevin beatty so i 'm also very pleased to see that he is he 's acting as the chair so we have a strong team to lead that giant organization um and i read with interest the delegates report and i noted in making some comments to mayor kellum about item 2b in particular the safe swift link and how it seems to have dropped off the new south wales government 's radar at this stage bath to the base of mount victoria would solve the problem i think the recent issues were the closure of the bells line of road due to floods um the problems uh to the east of mount victoria with the road um being reduced to one lane and there being traffic jams of up to nine hours from oberon and other and bathurst and orange back to sydney and from sydney which is still continuing which i personally um have experienced so i suppose i have to say that i have a declaration of interest there mr mayor and the problems currently with the train line and the various landslides if anything illustrates why there should be a tunnel under the mountains i think the current situation illustrates aptly why there should be a tunnel right through the mountains and i would ask that obviously the joint organization continues on this path of a safe swing swift and could i say reliable link because a reliable link is what we really require as well i have known people who left oberon at 2 pm in the afternoon taking until 11 has been rather diabolical um so i so on the basis of all that i am very happy to move the recommendations um that the council note report from the central central new south wales geo board jo board and they provide response to central western orion a transport plan as referenced in two a and b of the recommendation yes it 's a very comprehensive report and congratulations to yourself mr mayor on your appointment i 'd just like to make a couple of comments on 2a and 2b_._2715.92 we have lived in the central west and anywhere in rural new south wales the population assumptions that are used by the new south wales government do not reflect the lived experience or the quantified experience from census they assume that most small towns are declining in population and even a lot of regional towns except for the headline ones like machu or orange are also in the statement or declining and that is patently wrong and they are being taken the new south wales government has been taken to task by local government new south wales on that very between sydney and the central west is is important unfortunately the new south wales state government has abandoned the strategic planning space by not allow or sorry by disposing of land uh in the city of karajam which would have provided the link between an enhanced bells liner road and the m7 we are now left with a i 'll say a good tunnel between probably between somewhere around mid low bar through the bottom of mount victoria but what it doesn 't do is provide anything for the rest of the great western highway down to the m4 and being slightly oc on my last trip down i counted the number of traffic lights there are between katoomba and the m4 and there 's 28. there are also four school zones and they 're also also numerous changes of speed limits and i suspect that in 20 years time that particular stretch of road will be a striking resemblance to parramatta road and it is not a safe a swift or a secure link now the options are limited and i i have to agree with uh councillor mckibben it 's going to we have to first the ja first has to make sure that the state government recognises that it is leaving a legacy of absolutely atrocious transport links from the central west and far west uh through to sydney uh any other points yes um i also run into someone that had trouble getting back the other day but this should push our case to have a better bridge over the abercrombie and the other let 's see up across and further up car across and maybe that this person was talking to me he thought of coming around through canberra to come home to over and he didn 't come all the way uh i spoke to someone who did that last weekend but you 've always got the problem with the other comedy there is fire trial 13 that only requires 22 culverts and you sit on top of the range so we need the government to get off their bun stop talking like mr farroway does about these tunnels he 's on the road uh air the other day the tunnels won 't be build bridges in 12 months and we need someone to go down to spy trial 13 which sits on top of the range as an alternative to get over the west it might be a boost road and like the abercrombie roblox but yeah we need to get those people on the ground and have a look at stock thought thank you that council mccarthy and if you could show me on a map at some stage in the next you know i just take you on the journey i would love to see little fire trout okay any other comments [Music] all right seeing no more comments i uh put the motion recommendation all in favor county council meeting 11 february 2022 uh recommendations that the report item 1102 is received as information do i have a mover and a second up happy second thanks andrew yeah i 'm happy to to move this report and it 's quite comprehensive i 've noticed some of the comments in regards to the weeds and there 's been quite quite a few weeds popping up everywhere that haven 't_''_3008.48 been seen i 'm happy to move that that 's a lot and i 'm happy to second it thank you i found it a very constructive meeting and uh i 'm well aware of the problems as somebody who drives around the countryside and has planned himself but i 'm encouraged by the approach of the macquarie county council so happy to be part of it thank you and congratulations to councilman mckinnon who is now the chair of the upper upper macquarie county council which means we 'll get excellent weed service in over on for this year i might have to plead a declaration of interest uh mr manager well done andrew thank you thank you uh mr comment no i 've put the motion of this item report 1102 has received his information all in favor motion is passed all right committee reports item 1201 uh it 's the overall youth council and recommendations that council received this report item 1201 of information we 'll have a mover and a second please move is uh councillor graham and secondary council trimbast council great uh it 's a good it mentions in here that they were going to have a planning day which they have done and they were very keen to plan for the next couple of years really and their theme that focus just like to comment that they 're a great group of young people they 're very engaged they 've got some really exciting ideas which is really nice to see to be their um youth um they 're very keen on the community hub and actually in the background have been having chats with various people about how that could be used by them which is really interesting i think sometimes you just don 't know what they 're doing but in the background in their own little chats they they 've really jumped on that idea of having something available for them for space and yeah just in general i think there 's a lot of good things that are going to come from this group of youth in the coming years any other comments from anyone i 'd just like to back up both the comments about the quality of the youth that group i put the recommendation that the council receive item 1201 is information all in favor uh item 1202 on page 27 the local emergency management committee meeting and the recommendation is that council receive report 1202 as information do i have a mover and a secondary movement head counselor what and second council mccarthy councillor what um yes i 'd like to address the report it looks like a comprehensive report of a fairly wide range of activities and as you can see a very uh very important committee so you know i understand it 's a what they call it detailed report the only thing i can 't understand from the police point of view though is when the police attend a road accident and someone 's gone through a fence or something like that they believe that there are no obligation to go and notify the landowner that the fence is torn and the stock come out i just can 't understand this and it needs to bring it up at this it could save someone 's life that there 's been two occasions one on attended both of them the fence was torn and they feel their own no obligation to notify the landowner so i think that needs brought up at the next one that it should be a part of their procedure well we 'll at least find out why it isn 't manager 's taking that right now to bring it up at the next lmc any other comments or questions all right i 'll need information uh sorry i 'll put the motion that council received report 1202 of information all in favor ask unanimously the traffic advisory local committee meeting item 1203 the recommendation is that council receive report 1203 it 's information remover and a second replace council mccarthy and councillor uh hayden any other comments council tucker thank you mr mayor i i have a question and that depending on the answer um that may lead to uh moving an amendment um i i sent an email to the general manager sorry what are you gonna to move amendment on um the recommendation is the council receive report 1203 's information that 's the record that 's the movement would be to add a part two um and so that the question is a procedural one and uh you would have seen the email that i i 've sent concerning the requirement that uh council actually pass a resolution for any decision um that the traffic advisory committee is only an advisory committee and cannot approve regulatory devices and i i think that would extend to approving events of the nature of the north shore sporting car club rally and i referred to the the relevant clause in the guidelines that made it clear that uh it is not not sufficient for uh just to note the decision of the tell that it does require a council resolution could i seek some advice on that from the general manager so i have responded to your email um oh okay i haven 't seen it yeah it was like so i apologize so so ultimately the way that council has traditionally worked through these resolutions is the talc will make a a let 's call it a decision in principle those decisions in principle are always supported by the throw an amendment by council in this instance if there is any significant decision that you want to bring forward as a recommendation on its own then you have the power to do that under that under this provision so the way that the minutes are provided the how they 've been read is that there are a number of actions that we put out and we do all the with actions but what i 've indicated to you in my response was if there are recommendations that talc want to make to guide the decisions of council we will change the way that the reporting mechanisms undertaken where talc will then be given a recommendation power to council it 's not a it 's not a statutory obligation it 's just a recommendation and then council will determine those recommendations as they see fit at the next available meeting so traditionally what they 've done is the minutes have a overarching support by the top community which in turn gets filtered through the council through a through a set of minutes and council endorsed the minutes on the basis let that look at your late email but that 's not my understanding of the way the process is supposed to work it 's certainly not the way it worked uh back when i was involved we must we must go back to past history no no no i understand that but i 'm saying that uh from my reading of the of the guidelines for local traffic committees it does state that all proposals recommended by the local traffic committee must still be formally approved by the elected council and and in my view simply receiving or noting the minutes i don 't think does that sufficiently and through endorsement of the minutes the way that over the period of time that i 've been working in this space that is an adequate way of counseling endorsing the recommendations of those minutes that were tabled at the talc meeting if council or of a mind that they want to pull out individual recommendations or equally should a revision of what you believe that you want to be able to table two council wants to change i 'm more than action slash recommendation to council type scenario where they 're not minutes it 's a report back to council that outlines what they want council to resolve this way it gives the way that it 's been presented is supposed to give council and undertaking an understanding of what was talked about a resolution if council themselves had a problem with it they could raise it at that at the meeting but i 'm certainly not all right but i 'm going to stop the discussion here because this is something that needs to be taken elsewhere because it 's not going to be decided right now right and i 'm going to the put the motion all right all right if you 're about to i 'm about to put the motion yeah i had my hand up before you did that okay that 's what i 'm saying i 'm giving you the opportunity thank you i 'd just like to thank councillor mccarthy for raising the issue of vehicles not slowing down the stop signs but i 'd comment that 's it 's a complex issue it land service unfortunately is not able to enforce those requirements but it is something where landholders need to be better educated because they can 't just put up stop signs and in dangerous situations and expect traffic to be careful of that but also traffic needs to be aware of the risk of traveling stock so it 's an it 's an area of pursue because a number of farmers have raised this with me so thank you thank you good afternoon uh i 'll put the motion that council receive report 1203 is information all in favor [Music] all right what 's your decision item 1301 development application for the community hub at 72 dart street and 13 fleming street overall recommendation this is on page 40 that council approved development application 10.2020.91 for community hub at lots three and four in dp five four six seven five three being known as 72 dart street and 13 flemington street oberon in accordance with section 416 of the environmental planning assessment act of 1979 and conditions contained within this report for the following reasons the development is permissible within the the overall local environment plan of 2013 the development is considered to be appropriate and will not impact the locality unreasonably a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act in 1993. do i have a mover and a second drill councilman kevin seconder council of the trim of us councilman kevin you 're on youtube i think it needs to be realized by everyone that this is a development application it 's not talking about funding we 're not talking about any other issues that have to be considered by council um and in fact uh there is another decision to be made by council that may reflect on that um which is subsequent to uh to this uh this motion this is purely stating that we have a plan and we 've put a development application through and i note and uh i would ask the technical sorry the planning director to correct me if i 'm wrong but it is always possible that as a result of the second stage of this process which is um partly considered in a following resolution change and will therefore be maybe subject to an amendment to the this approved d a however this at least provides us with an ambit situation that we know is approvable on the basis that if we proceed with the hub that this gives us the footprint and the basic design and the parameters to which will apply to the proposed revised hub i know there are a number of concerns in the community and i also have concerns in relation to cost but as i say they 're not the subject of this motion um they are more to do with the following resolution and actions by council i 'd assume at future meetings uh not this one and um so they shouldn 't be taken into consideration in applying this d.a and as i said there is a possibility i assume and i 'll ask the planning director to correct me if i 'm wrong that if there have to be amendments on the basis of cost or other other issues that are subsequently raised those amendments could be considered quite expeditiously on the basis that that they that basis i am very happy to promote to propose the recommendations as listed there in relation to the development approval for the hub project thank you councilman council trimbath uh thank you i agree that we accept the ga application but also as andrew has stated mcgivern has stated that due consideration has been given in the second stage to with regards to cost and potential size um and it 's the two will come together later and as a new council not all of us have been across everything regarding the hub and we are listening to what is being said but we have to take on board the information that we have prior with all the consultations that happened but um i do think you should approve the deal council tucker thank you mr mayor i just have a question for the probably for the director of development as best as i can work out in relation to the parking for the development it talks about extending the angle parking in dart street and and it appears to me from what i could tell from the attached street going closer to the fleming street intersection and i i just want to point out that this was an issue that came up years ago when that angle parking was first installed and it was constructed as close as it could be to that corner without breaching the australian road rules and uh i would just like to ask that uh let that be checked it 's possible the rules may have changed it 's possible my memory may be mistaken but i suspect that those two days cannot be constructed without reaching that rule um and the other part of the question is is whether the extension of the angle parking is included in the tender price to be carried out by the contractor if if we do go ahead with the project or would it be done by council as a separate item from the contract thank you that 's welcome through the chair um because i impact assessment done by one of the consultants through our project managers who assess the uh the mental parking and the consideration of looking at additional numbers my understanding is can take that on notice and come back to you with some further advice um as part of the budget um some working kind that council will undertake and we 're in negotiations with councillors to have that if you need the actual discussion um regarding those extraterrestrials postpartum so that is a discussion um yeah i 've got a couple of concerns in regards to the roof the pitch is one of the concerns but also the connecting section between the hooper building and the hub on on the sixth page in one of the diagrams you can actually see how the who percenter comes across and then it actually drops down another roofing section up slightly drops across and up that 's leaving a huge gaping gap for a whole big snow load to fill that up and add a lot of weight and pressure to the entire building and underneath and i don 't think that that is basically suitable for our climate in that regard also why are there so many exterior cladding designs on the one building you have blocks then you 'll have bricks and then you have iron and tin and the timber so i 'm a little taken aback with the um the amount of external cladding for one building and then again there 's the size of the block and the size of this building and taking into consideration this what is already there it 's adding only another smaller space and my questions which i 'm asking the question is why are we looking at the final the the final draft of what is going into this da and is this roof going to be the same that 's just yeah sorry i 'm lost now but i can 't i can 't visualize that being acceptable so through the chair i 'm happy to defer to the project manager in this instance but first in regards to snow we had no option but to comply with the relevant snow loading requirements for the climate in which we live in that is that 's a non-negotiable so when you talk about errors that is what the the detailed design comes back and says that 's what it 's going to snow and wind loading so the gap here let 's say you have this big high here you have a height here and then it all drops down into here so that 's unfortunately when you can 't use box gutters there 's some design elements that you need to put into consideration but more than happy to defer to chris to give you an overview on what on the things you 've asked thank you so through the chat thank you for your questions um you 've discussed the roof pitch um the hooper connection and the snow load so all of the the um the roof designs have considered snow lines all the way through engineering design so i 've considered how the snow is going to get away um the appropriate design of the structure and direct console will be aware that we are looking at the roof design and save some some money in that space if they 've done that done so already that will all be considered in the the design of the roof on an ongoing basis and the snow load is suddenly the engines have certainly taken um the the movement of snow across the roof is is an issue that we will need to build and have dealt with um so council could be confident that the design is appropriate um the extent of the cladding finishes you mentioned um architectural design will often introduce numbers and finishes to articulate a building we are limited by two things one is the existing hooper building and the bricks that are on that and the existing the existing library building and the bricks that are on there there are different finishes in between and they articulate entrances and various other portions of the building and an architectural feature has been introduced with those and that 's where that really sits you 're suggesting that we 're adding just a smaller space um what we 're adding is functional space uh there is certainly part of the building the robert the hoofa building and the main body of the library is staying we are demolishing other areas particularly the old 1950s building which isn 't terribly functional and doesn 't give us a response are being demolished and the space that 's been added is very much driven from a functional requirement rather than just looking at the actual um the actual addition or otherwise it 's square means the final draft da i 'll come back to council of the cubans comments that the da will be submitted if it 's approved tonight then we go forward with confidence that we have a project that we can actually work forward on um that there is an approval in place that we can then further develop thank you can i just have an understanding we 're improving the va for the hope at the moment only what 's before us as a plan may not be the final result is that correct and that 's that 's why this there is like there is a possibility that there will be a uh amendment to this da yes and that 's what i 'm getting at thank you um i just think we might be putting the carpet for the horse in approving the d.a when we haven 't settled on design and we haven but i have concerns that this is being rushed a little bit but maybe i 'm wrong um through the chair i can only say that this this proposal has been developed on um over the last two years in substantial consultation with all parties that got to a point in time where a number of resolutions have led to the development of this project and this is where we 're at at this point in time it 's been rushed um i just want to validate counselor mckibben 's comments because i think he he asked for some clarification if he was wrong by the by the planning director and he wasn 't so no one said anything but this is a a da the construction civilian has yet to be even lodged with council that construction certificate should this da be approved would need to meet the general requirements of that da and if it doesn 't then we need to look at modification to that va and that is a standardized process across the board especially in this instance where you 're looking to meet the requirements in place doesn 't mean that the construction 's concerned has to come back to council through the chair a final design will come back to council for their sign off so yes it will thank you councilman kevin um thank you mr mayor i just like like one comment and people have probably noticed noticed it above the recommendation and just before the photograph on page 38 the first paragraph i think the reference to 10 am should be to 10 pm and that 's consistent with what is stated later in the report i don 't think we 'll be closing at 10 a.m in the morning and we 've actually said we 're having functions until 10 p.m yes now am i writing thinking if we support this da that that then gives approval for the hub to contin to be erected and do we have any future say in whether this project goes ahead or does not go ahead through the chair that is absolutely within your control right there i know and ongoing the da simply is a use application that says that if if you need to at least have some plans in place that allow that final design to occur so we should have basically in front of us what the project is going to be and how it 's going to be designed and what it 's going to look like and so far we keep getting this this these changes we have these discussions and we have these changes continuously and then there 's the budget restraints and everything separately on top of that so you basically clarified a few a few things through through the chair the budget is the thing that 's going to finalize the design yes even if we all approve this this is just a basis this is the use application and allows the project manager to advance the project councilman kevin i 'm going to see if there 's any other questions or comments and then give you the writer reply thank you anyone else comments suggestions no all right councilman can you hear the writer reply you look i 'd just like to reiterate that this is the as i said the development application treat these obviously separately but there is a motion that follows this motion um in which um central west project management is recommending a course of action which may result as i said in changes and amendments this da i just want to make it clear that this yes this is a step but council gets the final say on the hub and the amount we spend on the hub but that is a further progression of the next notice of motion that we are going to consider that follows this one i believe in the next item to be considered in business this is just saying all right we have a we 're approving a design that 's approved dependent on what happens in that next process and what happens at the end of the process envisaged by the next notice of motion as i said before i reiterate we may have to amend this but that but if we do go down that track and we do go ahead with the pub and there has to be amendments and we approve that then those amendments as i understand to be accepted and and those amendments could be considered in their own right without having to consider the total design concept completely which has already been done under this uh disapproval of the d.a so i just want to make it clear that there are a number of more of more processes that i think should allay councillor hayden 's um concerns and they will reflect the further processes that will go down the track following the motion we next consider um and i would imagine that um and i think it 's envisaged that in the next in april and may we will be in a possession better position to um look at the other issues such as cost constraints etc so this is purely the planning approval for a project and i i would envisage that there will be amendments to this uh resulting from the work that central west project management is doing as they 've envisaged in the next notice of motion thank you i 'm putting the motion as detailed on page 40. all in favor against councillors hayden mccarthy and mckenna are against procurement the recommendation is that council and enter a one month exclusive engagement period with barca proprietary limited to further explore cost savings and design requirements refinements for the community hub project do i have a mover in the secondary council mckibben second one council trenboth councilman um thank you mr mayor um obviously this has been alluded to in the previous recommendation um i think where we are we all know where we are in relation to the cost of projects and everything else is highlighted in this report um we all know that building costs are increasing rapidly so in the nature of where we are currently i think what is envisaged is obviously a very sensible proposal and that we will at the end of this one month period know where we are with at least one of our tenderers and whether we can come to an agreement um and what what the baseline cost of this project is going to be which we then as a council will have to consider what we do with and whether we go ahead bearing in mind and i would million dollars that is allocated to this project we really can 't_''_5136.639 not it we cannot allocate it to other projects and we cannot and if we don 't spend it we lose it so i think we have to go through this process that is envisaged in this paper and find out exactly where we are and if there 's a delta what that delta is and how we handle that or what we do but that proce and but we 're not at that point yet and that is what is envisaged we have to know where we are and this is going to provide us with the information so that we can then get to that position so on that basis i fully support this recommendation and i look forward to the updated report at the april meeting thank you mr man i 'm pleased to move this recommendation council tremble um yes i support um this recommendation um i know that um there 's a there 's a period of time where we have to wait to get to the next stage but as uh council project has been the general manager stated as well that this has been going for two years and a lot of consideration has been given to the the budget and what 's going to be allocated and how it 's going to be used and how we 're going to get to the right place and ensure that what we provide to the community meets with their expectations and reasonably within budget considering sort of what 's happening in the marketplace with costs and the longer we take to make our decisions regarding this the more it 's going to change so we do need to move forward and be ready in a month 's time to see what can be done a design is a design and architects will always design the biggest and the best because that 's well you know they would like to always give you sort of a great end result but um considering some of the restrictions around budget that we 've got i 'm sure that we can come to a place where we do get a great community hub center in oberon tucker thank you mr mayor i will be supporting uh the motion but i i do want to stress that doesn 't mean that i will necessarily be supporting any decision to go ahead with the project because that is going to depend on funding which is like others have said is is the biggest remaining hurdle that we all need to be clear about is exactly what it 's going to cost and exactly where that money is coming from but if we were to to decide today not to even give that one month extension i think we are opening ourselves up to criticism that uh that uh well you don 't know that it would be another budget because you didn 't allow that extra time for those negotiations and design changes and so i 'm i 'm willing to allow that that time and for those processes to happen and see what can be achieved and then consider how the funding works out when it comes back to council at a later date um yeah i 'm happy with the extra month um and we also of them is the semi kitchen and all the rest of it and i don 't think when we get a price back we should be leaving the doors off those division areas those division areas to be operational need those doors on so what was presented before isn 't the hub as far as i 'm concerned we were shown that those three areas could be used utilized separate and the costing of that has to be in the building i 'm sorry bill you can 't leave the doors off to get it under budgets as far as i 'm concerned thank you mr b i support um recommendation to go the extra month um but i think what we should be looking at in in this time is some major cost cutting measures and i think some of the ones that stand out fairly clearly uh moved the ctc back to the vic where there 's an ample room and it was quite functional there through but anyway i think that 's that 's one area that we can reduce the size of the building and the to go because it 's not needed we have the uniting church hall we have the malachi hall we have the showground hall black springs hall you know we 've got function centers in and around town we 've got plenty of places that can cater for up to anywhere from 50 to 350 to 500 people so i think those two areas are major concern cost wise um it 'll be interesting to see what the final cost comes back but my experience was in project management is that it 's easy to take one big cost out and it is to find 100 small ones and cut corners that way and i think there 's two major concerns there that we could we could reduce plus the kitchen a few other pieces cut the cost back down if we have to refund money we have to refund it but we can 't go over i won 't support going over yes um looking at this brief it 's asking for an extension for another month and whilst we 've been elected to council we 've discussed discussed the money that has gone over in its costings only to have to have another meeting and for a savings of a million so looking looking at it wholly i agree with what council councilman mckechnie has suggested as well that there should not be a cent over what was originally agreed with the funding and um yeah that 's my standard i think what we 're looking at this recommendation is giving a month to negotiate with the one thing nothing to do with anything else so i 'll support that recommendation are there any more questions anyone wants to speak for or against all right i 'll put the motion that uh the council enter a one month exclusive arrangement period with prior to limited to further explore cost savings and design refinements for community club creators oh yeah i don 't know what andrew wants to speak i know i 'm supporting the motion why do i all right page 57 item 1303 section 356 funding request recommendations the council approved the request from the oberlin arts council to repurpose a 20 20 21 22 section 356 donation tree project so i have a mover and a second councillor graham and council mckinney councillor thanks mr mayor um the comments here outlined the issue i think very fine line the difference of what the arts council want to do with that money originally it was for signage for artwork from the common and now they 're wanting to use signage for the blue tree which i guess can be extended to an artwork as well so there 's really not a lot of um difference why they haven 't used the money is because they couldn 't run the workshops and things that they needed to before through covert so it 's pretty straightforward really yeah thank you thanks for hanging out as you can see that 's pretty straightforward and no problem supporting it anyone else have an opinion all right uh i moved the motion that the council approved a request for the overall arts council to repurpose the 2122 section 356 donation of fifteen hundred dollars for artistic support to the blue tree project all in favor against council mccarthy against past uh age one the recommendation is that council adopted the o 'connell recreation ground master plan from outscape dated the second of march 2022 story number one of one revision b by the mover in the second one movers councilor mccarthy secondary council of trent bathward uh councillors there is a copy of that particular drawing on the but we need to know you know the list of which stages are going to happen with the funding now if you have a look on page 60 you 've got completed activity which is the fence and the other parts commenced um now the picket fence i understand the community wanted to knock down and on the then you 've got the car parking landscaping seating accessible tours change room doesn 't the community really want the change room and the thing in this one big uh fear and cheddar or for sake of a better word the meetings i went to that 's what they want so we we need to know what the stages are we want to know i was lucky enough to talk to engineer and they 're talking about turfing it or are we going to sew it down like if we can 't support it the the turf or and the irrigation we 're going to irrigate it without going on the center of the field and build the perimeter these are things that i think council need to know and and what cosmic is and yeah i 'm happy to move it but i need to know a list of priorities so what 's been prioritized there comes up to 838 000 which gives you 220 000 left but like the toilets well they don 't want that and then in this plan if you go across there it shows that [Music] they want two large 120 000 liter or 26 000 gallon tanks buried in the ground is that where does that fit in is that a part of the irrigation and you know we need to know a list so i 'm happy to support that plan we need to know a list of priority where actions are going to happen so through the chair um in order to develop the funding we had to the evolution of the of the ocon master plan that there 's been a number of recommendations and changes made by the by the architect and the community in relation to this in relation to this matter and we are also lodging applications with the with the funding authorities to change the the um the scope of that funding and getting support for the scope of that funding on the basis of we we 're assuming that this gets support this current plan is supported by council in relation to the turfing requirements we note that as part of the one of the funding there there was an allocation for a picket fence which our commit which was undertaken 18 months ago we know our community doesn 't want that so that 's one of the things that we 're looking to amend and one of those things that we 're looking to amend up with is well instead of seeding the cricket pitch or the wrecked round why would we look at turfing it if there if it 's a light for like value in relation to getting it would have otherwise been if we just see that naturally naturally so so there are a number of things but what the master plan does is give you an overarching plan which we work with in order to meet the expectations of the community very similar to the common master plan so yes we 'll be working on a list of priorities but there 's some that we 've already executed being the development of the of the cricket fields themselves so we 've also implemented some car parking um landfall so there are some there are some non-negotiables in how we develop the program but yeah we 're more than happy to bring back a list of priorities because the priorities will be based on the funding allowances that are being given through council resolution for this money to be give to to for this buddy to be provided with this project mr mayor what i 'm asking for is in simple terms and not big words what takes place next we 've got the cricket and the football first i 'm asking that we should be given a funding i i think casa mccarthy that priority list is actually pretty much covered by table one now the master plan goes a lot further than that but that doesn 't mean it 's funded so if you go to the second block it says cricket uh picket fence that 's that 's been knocked out by the community correct so the master plan doesn 't have a peaceful feeling so if you 're reading that as a layman it 's still in so as i 've indicated counsellor that 's why we 're being on the front for trying to get rid of that but still securing the funds to develop the the o 'connell master plan you 're missing the point yeah yeah wait on what i 'm getting at is if you 're going to go down the thing you 're putting irrigation and things in do you need those other two things to support the irrigation we need to know that that 's where the money 's going to be spent so through the chair we 're already looking at the irrigation design for the for in that space uh councilman kevin we haven 't got to the secondary yet right fine hands down for a little bit i 'll get i 'll get to you councilman i can see you um i 'm seconding the maths plan and i know i mean worked very closely on this that this final master plan clearly reflects exactly what the community wants the changes that they 've requested um there 's only one thing that they have been focused on and that is the community hall and how to incorporate some of the build be it the amenities block and the change rooms that that when the design is done that it is taken into consideration that the final will have a community hall and how to to bring that all together and not have an amenities blocking you know staff feature in the ground for many years so that was just um at the meeting last night they were very pleased to know that this was coming um it 's giving them everything that we need down there and um yeah i think it 's great and table um you know how it does still have that cricket the fence in there but most of the community know that that 's no longer in there so and the stages i mean i 've already put out um notices to alert people that the next stage after all the earthquakes are done which i must say we 've done at an amazing pace um that the irrigation and drainage was the next big issue that was being considered so that 's been pushed out to the community to make them aware that that 's happening but and then the next stage was going to be amenities and the basics um and the final stage would not feed the community again um communicated that to them that we need another round of funding to get to that stage because that 's another over and above the funding that we 've provided but i definitely second the master plan i think it 's great katrina 's done a really good job and i think we 'll get great feedback thank you councillor councillor mckibben thank you mr mayor um look of the master plan um however i would make a couple of observations and i i do understand as i think um council trimbath also said uh council mccarthy 's concerns and obviously some of these applications for funding were put in before the full plan was endorsed with great some unit community support across all sections of the o 'connell community and i think it was apart from anything else this has been a hugely unifying exercise in that community what i think what i believe we need well there are several observations first is i think with the current environmental conditions i 'm not sure why would we be looking at turf having sewn grass seed in the last year and a half i 've never seen such a good strike of grass seed and i would imagine the same would probably occur on the connell recreation ground if we were able to sow that grass seed this year that we 'd have an amazing amazing playing surface without the necessity to spend money on turf um that 's just an observation i 'd make from the last for pasture but i do think that we should that we should and i would propose an amendment or a part two to this recommendation and the amendment would be uh that council at the april meeting provide us with a staging in detail of the program of the intended um for the intended use of all the grant funds specified in table one so that we actually understand in greater specificity what is to be done for each of for for the total amount um and how it 's going to be staged and i do think that in respect to the accessible toilet change room and lockable storage we should also get some detail in relation to how that 's to be constructed so that it can be incorporated in the overarching um shearing set design but yeah councilman kevin can you just uh articulate your proposed amendment again so that the amendment amendment two is that count council provide oh sorry the council is provided at the april 2022 meeting a detailed staging of the of the project detailing how current grand funds are too expended on the i think it 's the toilet block and amenities and how they had to be constructed so they can be incorporated into the um yet to be funded um what do we call it what is it the total building or the um the hall or the yes the whole grandstand um through the chair rather than a report being brought back why don 't council staff through their architect just provide a detailed site plan showing the stages of the common master plan that we haven 't approved i don 't think you need a report to council we 're on we 're happy to go back to the to the architect and try and get her to um outline where the stages are rather than a report back does that i thought it i thought it 's probably past um now that the architect 's done their work i thought that as we 're project management we would be establishing how how the money is spent for each of the stages it 's it 's i think it 's we we have the design so i would say all right we 've got the design this is the broad range of things we 've asked in the grants so from those we 're doing the irrigation we 're doing sorry the drainage the earthworks has been done the drainage and irrigation are going to be done we estimate it 's going to cost that amount that means it 's going to leave this amount that amount 's going to be spent on this on the car park the landscaping the seating this will leave this amount the accessible toilets change room unlockable storage um bearing in mind that 's going to be part of an overarching grandstand hall this is how it is going to be constructed so that that can be incorporated this will leave this much money left and this is what it 's intended to do with that remaining money if there 's any i underst i understand what what you 're asking for i 'm just thinking of an easier way of providing it that 's all i don 't mind how it 's provided as but i don 't know that the really we 've got the architect plans now uh we had a board brush at the staging which was basically to get our grandson but i think now we need specificity and again i i you know i 've made the comment we talked about this um you know i i don 't i don 't think we i mean and this is an operational manner or maybe it 's council matter that i don 't know why we 're turfing with the current environmental conditions if we don 't get a decent strike of grass seed across that ground now we 'll never have kevin the your proposed amendment is up there on the screen now have you got it i 'll have a look at it so [Music] it was just including details the toilet and amenities block and how they had to be incorporated in the community hall i don 't i think yeah i mean we can have a different sentence after projects this include this should include details of the toilet and amenities block and how these will begin how these will be constructed so through the chair my only comment is is that do you want to report back to council or do you just want to be provided with that [Music] look i 'm happy either way but i know from uh previous experience we you know that these things these need to be noted as recommendations or they don 't get into the actions items that form part of the minutes through the chair once again i 'm not saying don 't have the resolution i 'm saying do you want a report provided back to council or do you just want that report be provided oh the report can be provided i don 't i 'm happy with that yes so it doesn 't change your intention of your so what it should read now is the council provide at the april 20 20. taking out the april 22 movie well i would like it i 'd like to come back to the meeting so that we have a date to be done this detailed staging report will be provided council provide a detailed strategy report you probably need to have april meeting april 2022 council meeting would it be possible to have the recommendation as number one point and what the proposed losers number two point if uh councillor trembath and council have given a degree well and and that 's exactly where i 'm going to go as soon as we get the language right in the proposal you think i 'm happy with that just take that out longing out and go to the next outline yep i 'm happy with that those changes yeah are you happy to have that as uh sorry one and two one and two yes [Music] with the wording that 's it so i 'll now put the amendment once it 's once it 's italicized uh and we need a one and two you take the first that out just all right you both agree with that yes okay i 'll put i 'll put the amendment ladies and pater that 's unanimous that amendment now becomes the motion okay so we now move on to item 1305 oh almost half past seven um so rather than start on 1305 we back at 25 735 not by that clock if you can stop recording please at this point remember i 'm resuming the council meeting at 7 35 with item 1305 oberon council annual contractor high tender the recommendation is that council nominate the open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 1668 alpha of the local government regulations 2005 for the provision of plant contractor hire services for the next 12 month period that is uh t 2022-3 at the conclusion the tender period all information will be assessed and a report will be put to the next available ordinary council meeting seeking endorsement of the annual plant higher contract panel for the 2022-2023 financial year do i move in a second council mckinney and council mccarthy councilman cagney thank you um it 's a pretty straightforward it 's a regulatory requirement that we need to follow to get a service that we need so i think it 's forward to recommend the uh report thank you carson mccarthy pretty straightforward thank you just procedural everyone else castle tucker just a fifth question thank you mr mayor um i uh contract operates and it 's similar to the the gravel supply contract of that discussion we 're talking about yes the tendering process yes that 's how the contract will vote and that 's exactly what i was about to say i agree with you and that 's why i 'm not going to raise those questions now i will attempt to deal with them out of session okay and if i can 't get answers uh to my satisfaction i 'll raise them when they come back any other thing else to speak on this item all right i 'll put the motion as recommended in item 1705 all in favor passed item 1306 the draft oberon street tree master plan public exhibition the recommendation is that council placed the draft oberon street tree master plan on public exhibition from friday the 18th of march until friday the 29th of april 2022 after which a further report will be submitted to council outlining submissions and seeking the formal endorsement do i have a uh mover that 's councillor mckibben and the second council of what um thank you lot of hard work by the previous council and this council recently in relation to this um i believe that this will set a very good scene for improving the overall livability and beauty of oberon and its district i must say i did go on to the link because i 'm haven 't got a hard copy and i had did have some difficulties in ascertaining where the the changes we discussed um previously at the streetscape meeting were adopted by the consultants but i have to assume they were it 's just it was very hard to read through the link or the portal um but i 'm i believe that this uh as is outlined in the project of objectives um this will enhance uh the livability and amenity of this of our town and it will assist with uh providing shade to people in summer for park for shopping and for using our town and i believe it has a whole lot of advantages and it sets us a plan for the future so that we don 't just plant trees ad hoc we actually have recommendation and very pleased to be able to move this recommendation uh to where we 've got to with this project thank you councilman kevin councillor much more than that we 've all had a good look at the plan and i think it 's a it 's a wonderful step forward um and obviously going to public consultation is the next step just a quick point i think that should be aesthetic importance in the comment rather than acidic to manufacture penicillin as well so yes i 'm having a second that it 's the first one oh yes yes that 's definitely multiplied yeah okay all right uh any other any other counselors council mccarthy yes mr mayor i 'm happy we 've come up with this plan but i think these people aren 't professional enough in respect that if you have a look on page i mean you have a look at the bring the trees right up on dudley street and the other night when we spoke about it they 've got the red trees coming in on their acorn road you can 't have the concept plan where they talk to place said this is yeah well there 's your plan you mean the general manager spoke but you know you 've got a sign out there but what happens is the people when you put this out next exposed looks is they believe that 's what can happen and it can 't like that you 've got to have these setbacks for sight fish i 'm sorry but it 's not really professional enough well i suggest we put a note in the when it goes on exhibition but okay the the the streets the virtual street escapes are um conceptual only and don 't take account of sight lines etc or something like that safety divisions yeah okay now i think that 's that 's a point well mate okay anyone else all right i 'll put the motion for the recommendation all in favor promotion is passed moving on to item 1307 the post heating upgrade for the independent living units the recommendation is that council install reverse cycle split systems in units one to four in curtis street and one four thousand dollars for the replacement and upgrades we funded from the 2021-20 building maintenance budget by the mover and second up councillor and councillor mckibben council hey yes i think this is this is well thought out and it 's well needed and um i think it speaks for itself um thank you mr mayor uh yes looking at the photographs and knowing that the state of the existing systems i think this is um is a necessary um provision and it will also mean that the maintenance costs um should be reduced as these will be new systems and and noting that these new reverse cycle split systems are usually far more economical to operate as well i think it 's uh it 's it 's a necessary um replacement project that we have to undertake so i 'm more than happy to second this recommendation in two parts any other councils that 's mccarthy um well i 'm happy for this to go ahead i think that one of the companies putting into this suggests that they go on the roof that 's how the water goes them on the ground because of our alpine climate and we dig the part that put the um drain water across the path here i don 't agree with them putting on the roof so just like that pass on to the director anyone else i 'll put the motion all in favor motion is passed uh item 1308 the over in sports grounds working party terms of reference recommendations that council adopt the term draft terms of reference for the oberon sports ground working party i 'm her in a second please counselor mckibben councillor tremberg councilman kevin thank you mr mayor these terms of reference and the um and the uh establishment of this working party have obviously been a matter that 's been considered by council previously um the i 've read the terms of reference and they seem reasonable except i would ask maybe that requires a small amendment in the third line under of objective it says consists of councillors staff and representatives of within the lga that may use the community sports complex i think that was representative of sporting groups okay so there so i could ask noting that slight amendment that that be made before the terms of reference uh are endorsed as final terms of reference i 'm happy with that but uh subject to that i am more than happy to move the recommendation um i second the recommendation and i 'm very glad to to have this because being on this working party you need the guidelines to keep you within your lanes and understanding what you what you 're responsible for and what you 're not responsible all right i 'll put the motion all in favor motion is passed 1309 on page 73 the code of meeting practice recommendation is that council placed the draft policy 1101 code of meeting practice on public exhibition from thursday the 17th of march 2022 to thursday the 5th of may 2022 and submissions be invited to council during that period with no submissions i received within the exhibition period the policies be adopted as presented we 'll have a mover and a second one council tucker councillor hayden council tucker thank you mr mayor we had a detailed discussion about reflects uh what we 've generally supported at that meeting so i support that recommendation yes it speaks for itself after our our lengthy processes of going through the papers um yes i 'm happy to support this thank you and i 'd just like to congratulate all the councillors i thought that was a excellent process we had the other week with a good discussion we 've reached consensus quite quickly on virtually everything and i think we 've got a good draft code meeting practice so thank you anyone else wish to comment you counselor graham were you all right i uh i 'll put the motion all in favor that 's unanimous and the promotion has been passed uh item 1310 the code of contacts um that council will place the draft code of conduct on public exhibitions thursday 17th march 2022 to thursday the 5th of may 2022 and submissions be invited to council during that period if no submissions are received within the exhibition period your policies be adopted as presented move them secondary please that 's tucker and councillor um council tucker thank you discussion last week because i think the uh what where i think the graph code of conduct is exactly the same as the model code of conduct and i don 't think we have any choice in this anyway so it 's just a formality to go through this process yes as council tucker has said it 's a definitive copy basically of the model code of conduct and um we basically quickly read through it all again last week so so yes i 'm quite happy to support this okay i 'll put the motion sorry anyone else to speak some mechanics i 'll put the motion all in favor the motion is one all right 13 11 council section 355 committees the recommendation is that council appoint the community delegates to its section 355 committees and working parties until september 2023 in line with the requirements of its policy 1114 volunteer and volunteers and section 355 committees that in part two council re-endorsed policy one one one four volunteers and section 355 committees as presented and part three council re-endorse the section 355 volunteers management manual as presented councillor hayden that 's some problems um just a clarification on 77 down the second last box shouldn 't it be a grouchy club of adrian shouldn 't it be a member and not the whole lot so that you had someone just represent it not if you give it a moment you could get out voted oh you never know what happens and on page 78 um i thought councillor and he indicated he wanted to go on the heritage committee and he 's absent on that list but i i thought that was his request that he not phoned through today um no no nomination was made by a counselor to be honest he phoned me after i 'd phoned him a couple of dollars over the weekend he said that he thought he made application to go on through the chair that 's definitely not the case um i had some checks from uh being done he doesn 't believe he did actually fill out the paperwork and may have missed it so that was my last conversation with him so i don 't think well through be online i think we should preclude that um if someone shows an interest in these communities after the endorsement if council online to endorse this if at some point in time the committee gets a nomination from someone to sit on that it 's simply a matter of bringing that back to the council and get endorsed that way it still gives council that option to say no but it also gives council the option to in fact endorse that process okay and on page 78 also um do we need three people from the public community to go on the tenant panel that was all where it 's used to be only four table and then now you 're going to end up with sticks but i 'll leave it under the council mary vayne 's field position and had great knowledge of the community and so through the chair it 's purely an application that 's been received if counselor of mine to reduce that then that 's your you have that ability to do so but and council mccartney 's rights usually just want there has on that panel customer kevin yeah i support council mccarthy on that um i would suspect that i 'm on that committee no on that panel so i was suspect that the strongest choice there would be mary bayern i 'm pretty sure that i 'm a firm believer in the smaller the committee the better better job they do if you want to slow something down stick a few more members on it i 'd be only accepting one of those and mary bone would be my number one thing just a coin yes i 'd just like to um to make a statement in regards to the independent living units panel i understand that by having a small committee you can often get things done quickly and efficiently sometimes we 've got to look at the factors of our aging population and a couple of the people that have actually applied to this are very experienced and very dedicated in the field especially one of them with aged care and i figured having someone with that kind of capacity and experience would be so far better beneficially due more things that may be needed in the care factor than at other times that 's all i have to say on there oh does anyone else wants to speak to this counselor yeah just in in reply accounts for hayden these are actually independent living units they 're not supported by aged care providers so i think we need to keep in mind that um yeah i know some actually does tremendous work and you know well as i said my my feelings would be that mary burn would be the stronger option it 's just an individual thought all right um well that means we 're not going to win if we cut down those numbers we won 't be endorsing it as um as presented so you need to move an amendment to make that happen well we have an amendment that we use the or that we select one application that [Music] the community representative on the independent living units uh is as a single person we need a resolution very [Music] so i 'm just making sure that if it 's it 's the amendment recommendations the members of the public to make an application to be part of a committee so that 's not going to support the change on that they 've already done that you know that that 's fine so you now need them all right so now so we 've got that there it 's just procedural um so you 're adding a 0.4 so it 's all those three points as an independent representative on the independent living units there 's a community as a community [Music] like copy that yeah sorry you just wait for your minutes no no that 's why she 's done that so now you 're looking for a second listen all right where 's second before councilman check these amendments council of taco i think i 've said enough no daddy um thank you mr mayor i don 't personally know the people involved but i 'm happy to take the uh advice of those who do and uh i think councilman mccarthy would have accepted uh he moved the motion my understanding so uh it 's just to help get the amendment any people involved in this but my gut feeling is that i would prefer to accept they 're narrow up to one they 're not planning d-day here this is just independent living units people put their names forward just being happy to be involved in this important committee and so my preference would be without knowing any of the individuals and no virtues about the independent units either through the chair it relates to panel selection only it doesn 't relate to anything that goes on in the unit it 's about selecting people to go into the units [Music] and there are other um members apart from councils and it 's uh medical center and uh okay well i 'm happy to be advised by people much better informed than me on this in this case right i was just going to mention that you got the doctor the chemist so and the independent person that you 've chosen you 've got a good array across the section the community what 's going on so yeah and then the counselors i 've always been four and and to andrew godin one day very queer so that was a new one can i just ask so these people have put themselves forward clearly they want to be while they 're volunteering as all these wonderful people are how do we let them know now that their applications many as per tradition perhaps well it is part of the communities as the general structure has always been one but that doesn 't mean once again you can 't anymore so this is the council 's decision all right so we have not very endorsed section three five five oh sorry growling the first one can you scroll down a bit here one awesome original number one sorry there that 's it that 's fine so okay so that 's saying the name to people except for into the independent living units which will be mary b and only so yeah so this this this amendment yep seeks to endorse all the people and they 're going to cover like the delegate is a given like will that doesn 't need to be formalized in a in a recommendation the third indicating only one one community representative as this amendment sits right no more speakers on for the amendment all right i 'll put the amendment all in favor the amendment becomes the motion all in favor of the motion passed i have to declare that i i may not have raised a declaration of interest in that i was a council member who received superannuation payments prior to july 22 and therefore second part may apply in the council staff will have to work with me in relation to that i don 't know if there are any other councils in the same boat i 'm going to say i i hadn 't really thought of it that way and i will have to accept that uh i have potential conflict of interest yes at which point i will vacate the chair and it can 't go to the deputy i will ask the most senior counsellor which is councillor mccarthy to come back to the chair or just take while i 'm on that issue um mr mayor i i i had noted um it 's slightly related issue and has gone on public exhibition notes that someone on an audio visual link has to apply such as myself in the current situation has to apply to the general manager which i did formally but there actually has to be a resolution of council to approve me attending as audio visual link that is in 5 24 now that may not be applicable and has not taken effect yet because it 's on public exhibition um and maybe i should make a submission but there does seem a bit of a dichotomy there well make application to the general manager and there 's been a resolution that i 'd be permitted to attend by audio visual link at the beginning of this meeting yes exactly i i wonder whether that just needs some change of wording but i 'll discuss that later with the general manager anyway i 'll leave the meeting um how i 'll take my mobile if someone can give me a ring on it to come back in just start going um why can 't there be a request from the general manager for the well go down that track but mark and i that mayor and i can 't vote on that okay all right so are you happy to come and take the chair for this particular discussion all right time has started and and matt could you just give me a buzz on the mobile yeah under the room today or you can mute me whatever you like 807 and council mckibben is uh upsetting himself from his zoom link uh leaving the room and councillor mccarthy is assuming the chair for this particular fight rather than leave the zoom i 'm going to walk out the door and close it that 's fine okay councils you 've got a recommendation before you do the ride off the money as further report or you can refund it as a third eye so [Laughter] number three is any of the council is caught up in it uh in in the mistake can refund the money if they wish um option two would allow us to do that just to work with the councils to work out the best way forward if you just don 't have a mover and a second to get counselor off that 's what you said in the mirror i don 't know of course [Laughter] all second whatever you want me to read i i think that just because you 're the chair wouldn 't mind having to but okay you can do it if you want like it 's okay ellen michael um so council is just uh just to assist um council hayden and councillor grey just in relation to this council 's previously put a set of documents together that pay council super for those wishing to to get it in 2021 and it 's supposed to start in 2022. what we 're simply proposing to do is work with those councillors who who in fact received it and you as a group of councillors whose client who 's indicated they want to get super have already received one payment we 're simply suggesting what we do is we just defer that first payment into 2022 and then commence from there and those who have collected it that are currently still councils we can work councillors where this is effective which is why we 've asked for the thousand dollar write-off so if that gives an indication on what it is then um that gives you the opportunity to make or ask questions if you want okay you got to report those four oh if you want to speak on it where you go thank you the chair um yes no this was explained to us when we were at our briefing last week and i 'm very happy to move this motion and i 'm sure that this will all work itself out in the long run that was made through the chair um there may be difficulties in recouping the actual money for tax purposes for each person that 's involved so working with the existing counselors probably covers most things yes it 's not as simple as just paying back the money i don 't think okay okay you gotta think that 's how it 's done back in the chair [Music] page 82 reports for information um and the first one is of course the general manager 's report 1401 and a second short a few um staff members but we 're trying to do black spots and you know the current environment it 's good to see the cfo or whatever [Music] finance person thank you yes it 's a pretty straightforward report and i 'm sorry to hear those that have come down with covert i hope you come quickly then leave it ahead and um i 'm happy to second this support council tucker thank you mr one quick question and one quick correction the question is on page 84. i can say the second dot point about canvas river road it 's just a repeat of the question i asked last month about a reply to an email i sent after i received a complaint from a member of the public about the road condition just after that track rollover and and you said last month that uh yes it would be a reply to my email and that you would copy it for councillors you know just chasing that up through the chair when that investigation is finalized we will deal with that all right i parts that have been dealt with but there are other parts of the requirements thank you additional details thank you the small correction is on page 89 the first item 10th of february i don 't believe you attended this meeting any other thank you thank you mr mayor page 83 under risk management um unless i 'm incorrect i thought we 're basically the same position we 've been for several months upon the finalization of the activity a report will be tabled the over an audit and risk committee for coin prior to being forwarded to council um that does not seem to have moved very far in the last several months through through the chairs because we 've had to disband in the america and once we get up and running it will be tabled at that meeting um so it 's not going to be forwarded to council in a draft form to even consider at this stage um through the chair there 's many drafts being submitted project this is simply a matter of taking what we 've approved and adding that to our corporate with our appetite okay um because i i 've seen i think i saw the september version and i don 't know if it 's been updated since then has it through the chair it 's the next phase of taking our complete corporate register and now putting that or sharing that amongst our categories together with our risk appetite for those for those each individual category so we have an understanding of where our appetite is and what bits would give you some comfort in taking some risk and what would not though i 'm just questioning whether it 's uh because now we we have gone through that next step whether it because eric and that was my next question which will come to it but whether it 's worth uh circulating that the council is at least at this stage so we can get an idea of that and even making comments before it goes to eric which may be of assistance or not i 'm more than happy to provide that in draft form council you will you will you will you know um the the policy but i real this goes a lot further than the policy i understand that it goes far further down but i think it might be of um it might be the systems um now with the eric reestablishment i know that the central west joint organization of councils might be doing something but i also know that central west water blaney council and i and i believe upper macquarie i know if a macquarie are working on doing something in that area space for their respective organizations as well overall council 's also in principally supported that project as well of course we 're all tier one council yeah that 's that 's why i 'm yes so i that 's why when you said central west join organization i thought well there 's also a subset of that organization doing something as well so that 's why i 'm so you are looking into that that as well i understand through the chair we are part of that program yes okay fine no no because i know it 's it 's but certainly being considered by the macquarie costs over the various organizations involved okay um they 're the only comments i have um mr mayor and very happy to see a cfo have been appointed as are we [Music] uh any other comments all right i 'll put the motion oh can i raise one issue that i i forgot that i had here if i could mr mayor um so the y management agreement page 89 there are several uh references to meetings with legal legal representatives etc read the wire management agreement i thought that was already in place there 's an issue arisen out of it or is it still not signed through the chair it 's the the management the contracts in place it 's just meeting with people from the y about certain sections of that management agreement and whether they implement parts of it so does that mean they have an issue with implementing parts of it or they believe it 's it goes too far from what they 're actually should have been engaged to do i 'm just i don 't know it 's more to do with the unclear it sort of alarmed me a bit that maybe we hadn 't i thought we 'd signed the agreement so it was a bit yeah obviously yeah operation okay right no problems i 'll put the motion report 1401b receivers information all in favor pass unanimously planning and development the recommendations that report 1402 is received as information the move in a second please council hayden and councillor tucker yes it 's pretty straightforward good to see things happening the two car space carports and the roof finally and up and running and the swimming pool complex upgrade that is any other comments council mccartney ladies first i 've got two um yeah just a waste facility has anyone touched base with anacond group um recently apparently we 've been offered an easement are we going to take that offer up we the offer there is a request for support to get the power under their property as is have we got anything through the chair we 're working with that individual owner and also essentially because we want to do it underground essential saying oh it 's a 're we 're having a conversation with them about oh this is a large lot residential area and george we must take part in king 's estate some of that 's underground in the rural suburbs yeah and this is to do with trying to get them to understand this as a large lot residential area not a rural zone and um okay with r j regularly services they 're doing a volume metric survey right the survey that 's been undertaken by a surveying company from baptist but they are undertaking through their expertise to do an assessment of the the volumetric survey done in 2018 versus the one done yeah i understand that director what i 'm concerned about is we have people turning up the compacted waste bins and they scream out when they 've got one and a half full and they want to ring the office we should have the size of those bins and they turn up to our operator that is the size of the truck they pay for they don 't ring up and say bring the lady in the office you away turn up they 're either 12 meter bins or whatever it should be a status to your requirement that when they turn up that 's and that 's not there at the moment watch this space in our fees and charges document for 22 23. all right it 's taking a while to get on um my understanding is that they 've got a separate agreement through again through the volume based numbers okay thank you a counselor about a council trimbas council through the chest projector um i 've been looking at all your va applications and i know you said it slowed in february but it was owned by two from the previous stuff so um based on 20 working days in the months i think um your team are getting quite a lot of applications in the last few months i 'm glad to see that you 've got someone coming on board to help only question is when does that person start and what do you think could be the timing around trying to clear some of the backlogs through the chair i had confirmation 11th of april if that does happen um and as part of um obviously that person coming on board we 've looked at the current contractors remaining for a period of time to reduce the backlog yeah they 're still also i 'm looking at uh health and doing surveyor as well so we need to keep in contact with for a period of time to get the numbers they must be drowning at the moment with the amount of if you look i 've broken it down into months so i can see as they 're coming through and they 're fast definitely so um thank you councilman kevin uh thank you uh mr mayor councillor trembath has raised a number of issues which i was going to race i 'm glad she did so but just back to the oberon waste facility comments on page 90 um i thought the js regulatory services and this is probably in response response to council mccarthy 's volumetric surveys were all were indicated they were going to do that in their report to us originally so i 'm assuming that their original fee structure that they afforded to us is that not correct through the chair it 's an additional requirement to the their original quote however the um they did indicate that would be part of a future future works that they were supposing to do for council if we asked so the next paragraph um it says the site inspection when was the site inspection also consider the progress of short-term recommendations from the jso report dated august 21 and a progress will be provided to back council does that mean back to council through the chair that 's correct yes and when was the site inspection done and when do we expect that report through the chair the site inspection was undertaken approximately four weeks ago yep yes i 'm anticipating the report will come before council at the next meeting you know in april um and i thought it was indicated at the last council meeting that this uh the trial of the telehandler front-end loader should be completed by this council meeting that 's what my notes said through the chair that was correct however we a high company we 've now received quotes and there 's availability of equipment to um to move forward so where you say during the period i 'm not sure what period and there should be a trial will commence in march and will be completed and the report provided to council by the april meeting on on the tiller handler front end loader trial i 'm just i 'm trying to it 's just unclear from what you 've said under these things the timings on everything we can 't just refer to periods because we don 't know what periods we 're talking about through the chair i understand council has given that should be uh period probably i think originally was six weeks so i think that report would have to come back before council for the uh the meeting after april or so in may we go ahead with the trial in the next week or two so why does it take why will it why can 't it be in the april meeting because you can 't have a six week trial period and then right well um so that so that i don 't have to keep noting these things down coming back to them is there any way of recording these somewhere no because it 's not a resolution apart from the director doing that right now and and me also doing it so yeah well i mean my notes say that the quotes etc front end loader were anticipated to be at this meeting well um i would have thought that the report should have said quotes are being assessed due to a hold up um the trial will has not been completed by the march meeting um and it is anticipated that the report will provide the may meeting uh due to the six-week trial period or something it 's been noted by the general manager and the director yeah but i just asked when these reports are written that as i 've said before these matters are not they 're not resolutions so they don 't get reflected in the resolutions um um report that they carry forward actions from the action resolution so we need somewhere else for them oprah on waste facility section i don 't believe properly reflects the time frames that were previously discussed at the last meeting and i realize that there can be extenuating circumstances that mean that these get thrown out but they should be then saying well we can 't do it because of this and that 's what and we 're anticipating it 'll be at the may meeting but that should be reflected thank you mr bear all right anyone else got comments or questions council mccarthy we 'll come back and council um just what was the result um to the director from the um scrap metal through the chair um are you suggesting the the door yeah the um it 'll be in your report at the end of the year so these things that you can see the confidential sorry sorry there is a contract that we 've bended into the council with a with a tenderer that would dictate the terms exactly i realize that quite often when you 're doing road works and things like that at the end of the year it produces a just amount with this contractor and yeah anyway i 'm fine just through the chair this is not spending money this is receiving money i 'm trying to yeah i 'm happy with that but the amount of money is involved to me it 's so blase the way that no one records how many loads went out no one records the weight when they 're on the truck and i just think that it 's not even right we should have a camera out there on the tip knowing their activities are out there operation house and i appreciate that they can go there they 'd go there after hours to pick up this scrap metal but we should know as a council how many loaves go out through the chair they do take the loads to weight away station in sydney and uh and that 's then confirmed back through a report from the the company to council um they don 't know the wait until they go to the chair they don 't have to wait until they go to that place station back in cities [Music] and they 're not exceeding but anyway anyway let 's get it going yes mr very very yeah oh sorry joshua miner comment uh just on the animal pound i noticed that all cats were disposed of in april on the side of the graph you seem to have provision for disposing of half a cat can he join your team all right thank you councillors i 'll put the motion motion is passed all right moving on to 1403 technical services active monthly activity report recommendation is the report item 1403 is received as information move in a second to please council mccarthy council mcgregor thank you mr mayor um yeah quite extensive um just a clarification if we can from the director is that right that the principal contractor out on the campbell 's river roads terminated his services or the information i 've been given incorrect he completed his work through the chair that 's correct he has finished his services pending a another engagement uh so yes that that is correct so has he finished his work or or someone got to finish it off um work to be done unfortunately the current uh provider couldn 't um stay on with us so we are looking at sourcing that out and we 've uh we 're in discussions now with alternate contractors to be able to do the last uh one kilometer which is outstanding given the rain delays so that 'll be undertaken here in the next week okay and lowe 's mount um i suppose i don 't live on it but i 'm just wondering where you 're pulling up in respect of gilgamesh lane you 're going to pull up there in light of the railway line has been up upgraded should we forego the kilometer back towards board is it that does anything have to be altered there uh through the chair yes certainly i 'm just going past the bend of gilham 's road back onto that straight that 's where the road worked for stage one will terminate uh at this stage the timing with uh regards to the cooler weather is is most concerning i suspect in in terms of taking that work on past borgs uh we that component at this stage because i think it 'll just get too far too far cold in terms of bitumen ceiling work okay thank you for your report there 's a lot of work on the common everything 's going thank you thank you mr mayor um very good report um a lot of feedback from the community on um on the work that 's going on especially with the outdoor staff in re you know coping with the uh the wet weather and the extra growth and grass and our green areas around towns and the villages they all look um extremely well we could drive out through barricade back through our column around the other day they look really good so um that should be passed on to chris 's start the um the heavy patching works on the vatice road had a lot of comments uh about the success of it and how good a job it was and so that 's another it 's always good to get the good feedback and so i 'm just passing that on um and very happy to see bayfield intersection that 's been an issue for a long time and uh good to see the work commenced there going forward so yeah i kept that problem second in the thank you mr mayor just one question for the director i 'm just curious about given that we 're we 've had such a wet year and we 're now three quarters of the way through the year and i know that where that can really push up the demand for road maintenance work in parts and gardens i 'm just curious as to how we 're tracking budget laws on those activities and are we looking are we likely to have any other runs [Music] through the chair um since council otaka at this stage the all programs are tracking uh on budget um only with some delays with regards to weather of course um i don 't anticipate that there will be any overruns on particular roadworks uh budgets um so yeah that should answer that question i think well it 's referring to maintenance small size and construction right okay so you get through the chair some concerns there in regard to uh how that is tracking uh we are monitoring that through the quarterly uh budget reviews um so that 's just something we 'll need to uh just be wary of and again with uh some of the national disaster claims that we 've um we 've all natural disaster events that we 've gone through we 've certainly got some claims that we need to make um on some of those particular unsealed road networks just going back to a couple of issues the campbell 's river road where the contractor has walked off without having completed it surely that 's a breach of contract even though there 's been extenuating circumstances of wet weather that contractor is engaged to complete this project which he hasn 't uh through the chair yeah certainly uh look with regard to the engagement of equipment that 's really not a real big issue it was more so the stabilization which was the bigger ticket item for that for that work we did engage a particular company whilst they had the equipment there to extend on some road upgrade however they did indicate at a certain point uh prior to christmas they did have some some other future engagements um understanding that look uh we could not withstand um them leaving uh they had that had it informed us uh so we you know certainly as i said going down the path of engagement to finish that off with a with an alternate company but we as a council approved on a tender basis the allocation of stabilization work on campbell 's river to a contractor to undertake that stabilization work if that 's what we approved we believed we had entered into a contract with that contractor to complete the stabilization work the contractor has not completed that are you telling us we didn 't sign a contract with that contractor to that effect through the chair we have completed the stabilization component what i just did say though and i just said that we did extend the work with regard to graveling that doesn 't involve the stabilization and that was made aware at the time that they did have a certain time period to of the day that 's not part of the contract they were a sublet company in which we had a separate conversation with well as i understand it and i believe there have been a number of in incidents on campbell 's river road this contractor hasn 't stabilized the road particularly well and you admitted that in the last meeting that there are soft issues on a number of the shoulders on the road which to me means that they either hasn 't been rolled properly stabilized properly or the gravel is not correct but i 'm no expert in these matters i 'll defer to others who are so does that contractor have some liability for those issues which as i understand it um um there were certain issues with several trucks as and as councillor mccarthy said at the 15th of february meeting uh forestry corp had said to their people to be very careful on the road as of others so does that involve the contractor that has walked off has left the job through the chair it 's not to do with the stabilization component by the stabilization contractor again we 've had some issues here just recently with regards to material and wet weather and those those issues are being worked through as we speak so again i think it 's unfortunate regarding the weather more more than anything so and the gradient of the section of road that was uh actually where it occurred on campbell 's river road so that 's what is delaying us at the minute and finalizing this particular uh particular road work unfortunate to the the contractor having to depart for a prior engagement is it true that some gravel was put on the road and then removed yes that is true there was some gravel put down on the particular road it was quite a steep gradient on that particular section of road it did get wet it had to be wind road to one side and again to try and get it through a period uh where trucks could get traction on that grade which uh the material had to be removed and stockpiled for reusing in another location at a later date when it did that particular scenario unfortunate as it is we are addressing it as we move forward so it 's not that it 's not the um it 's not the gravel quality you 've had a pretty good crack at this and other people might want to have a say as well uh look through the chair again it 's not the gravel quality i don 't believe look again the production rate from a particular quarry the gravel wasn 't uh i suppose as moist as what we were receiving and that was because it was in production again that went the other way when the wet weather come and we got excessive rain on that particular section road that was exposed to the wet weather so that 's just the unfortunate outcome of what has occurred okay thank you is there anyone else who 's got questions i don 't have a question i 'm just going to comment that um the team through the chair you definitely have quite a lot of work happening um across the lga and i suppose just reiterating that the work that was that that contract was carried out to work and you know left it in a place that everyone can see exactly what 's going to happen and go from there so it 's really good any anyone else i 'll put the motion that uh report be accepted as as information all in favor thank you monthly activity report for corporate services uh first issue the summary it talks about november 21 to january 22 that in fact should be just february 22. recommendations report 1404 is received as information so i 've moved and seconded please council hayden councilman pretty straightforward report full of plenty of information and i 'm quite happy to move it customer card uh pretty straightforward and it 's just a concern about the ctv that the tourist hotels have no town how long 's that one 's been down we checked every friday and if one wasn 't report working we were to get a report back i 'm sure that 's the case because they said that we 'll make sure we 'll check it and we didn 't have to have an okay that 's why we need a process that someone takes off every friday to say that they 're working thank you uh through the chair um as council companies indicated there has been some issues there we do receive a live feed from 20 odd cameras on a daily and that particular venue has not had electricity quite some time so we have we have reworked the network to get around that because it is it 's a daisy chain system that we do have and with some of the infrastructure problems we had with the camera at the medical center we 've we 've repurposed some of that from the tourist hotel so we do check uh the feeds uh every week but that has been a particular issue with the way that that old system is mounted there so we do we are looking at a report on the whole network to come back to council but that one is when we 've had to move around in terms of no parent or venue well i 'm not having a go at viewing that i 'm saying and then we were told that we didn 't need it because the insurance of the staff we 're going to check it every friday so what i 'm getting at is it hasn 't been working for a while and we never got this process to say hang on this is this one isn 't working and anyway director just said that we 're working on work arounds in order to keep our network operational the tourist hotel one that looks at the tourist hotel also hasn 't had any activity at the tourist hotel missing the point that 's the manager anyway let 's move forward okay anyone else with questions or observations i 'll put the notion that the report got in item 1404 is received with informational in favor thank you uh item 1405 the statement of investments in the council recommendations council receive report item 1405 as information move respectively please council mckinney and councillor hey awesome [Music] unless we 've got quite a lot of investments maturing in 2022 but unfortunately with what 's happening overseas and um in reserve bank rates here you for and i 'm sure that 's all in very capable hands that 's all 107 yes i 'm very happy to second the report i didn 't want to ask the question of um how come [Music] we collect the amounts as they are and invest in so many different banks instead of just um say leveling it yeah through the chair the the approach is based on uh ensuring that significant cash flow so generally we mature a term deposit every fortnight to allow that we have ongoing operations and we try to spread the risk around them uh the management account will obviously work through their third parties to secure the best rate at the time so that 's what we do a reasonable spread across the portfolio we also have the investments policy that dictates how much we can and who spend with each individual institution to try and spread the um the risk yeah minimize the risk any other comments from anyone put the motion uh all in favor we 're gonna find the past 1406 grants monthly update uh recommendations report item 1406 has haydn councilman gibbons thank you i 'm very happy to move this and note that we have uh received from the black summer bushfire recovery grant uh amounts for the auburn visitor information center the vic revamp and the former councillor carrie gibbons will be very pleased to see that the mike springs hall energy and heating upgrade project has been awarded 52 000 he 's campaigned for that for a long time um and um i 'm not sure if this was made known to the community on monday night it was not there i could ask councillor hayden through you uh mr mayor if they 're aware of this yes they are aware of it and they are very happy about that the only concern they had was um reconfiguring from a center roof installation to the side wall um and also it 's pleasing to see that our uh toner heritage railway and the oberon district museum each received independently grants for their respective organizations i 'm very happy to um to push this recommendation i note also the lot of work that 's been done on roads albion street campbell 's river and the abercrombie road um [Music] and i note that our do we have any idea when the um building better regions fund r6 will be announced in relation to the uh over on sewer treatment plant 2.3 million through through the chair i think it was december wasn 't it no february february 22. it was lodged it was about the time it was due to close about five days after we got that very uh strong letter of support from andrew g for that particular grant so we don 't know when they 're going to be um making their determination i think probably within a month okay fine um all right yeah thank you mr mayor i 'm happy to move the recommendation yes it 's pretty straightforward and i 'm happy to see all of the allocated grant and funding um a bit sad with the couple that were unsuccessful but there 's plenty more coming up and i 'm sure that there will be some more allocations in the future okay anyway uh council tucker thank you mr a to the road classification review first stop point albion street it says reclassification from a local regional i was under the impression albion street was already original or has that changed chris i 've done mute chris yep sorry through the chair um i think there 's a typo on that particular report which uh the grants coordinators incorrectly put that as a local it should have said state to regional uh sorry regional to state road that 's what we 're looking for as part of the classification reclassification just to confirm our second question is on the third dot point on abercrombie road um just after an indication of uh if that application is approved if that goes to a state road that would reduce our block grant for regional roads but um but offsetting that would be uh increased work under presumably it would come under the rmcc and i just wonder if you have any thoughts on what how much would block grant produce by and any guesses as to how much work we might get under the rmcc on that road again through the chair would reduce the the regional race block grant uh 70 kilometers off road uh to be in fact out of 104 kilometers is a significant amount of course and again there are questions that have been raised by other councils uh in terms of losing regional roads particularly if they were to become state roads then if those councils like over on council involved in state road maintenance council contracts what does that look like is just unknown at this stage so we 'll just have to watch this space unfortunately i don 't have that answer at this stage yeah and i guess the point that i was leading to was just that the top grant is very reliable funding we get uh pretty much the same amount each year with a gradual increase whereas the work under the rmcc can be a lot more up and down and it could make budgeting more difficult without knowing just how much work there 's going to be in any year that was why i was asking thank you nothing more i 'll put the motion uh 1406 is received as report recommendation is the report item 1407 is received as information mccarthy speak for itself but still concerned that we get in dirty water and one of our um businesses can 't operate now the value is disheartening yeah because it 's been cleared up since so you can operate i understand that the uh director the services went down it 's all clear now yeah chris yeah through the chair um yes the issue has been cleared again it seems to be problematic um matters post weekend we are taking additional steps again as stated to the proponent of the business that we will be flushing just as a precautionary measure early first things on mondays just to ensure the water mains are clear as they can possibly be we 're currently in the process of um escaping the work with clear flow australia who were who were awarded the water main cleaning um of the reticulation so we 're hoping to have that program very shortly in in its undertaking uh they were delayed given the floods um across the uh office well across the state and in uh we did have discussions with them today and we 're working on a on a scope i 've worked for for everyone so that 's where we 're at at this stage thank you mayor i don 't think i have a great deal ahead on this report um i i guess i 'm probably for a discussion later i 'm not sure why we get spikes of iron and manganese i presume that 's related to our geology or our soil and that 's contributed to our water quality problems and the dam in which you get it from but that is also what you get it from but that will be related to geology and sort of yes [Music] um when we 're reading our water and sewer reports um we 're reading about manganese and iron and other issues do we ever get a report on the fluoride and the treatment that happens on our waterline site did we get a report on that at all now that that 's something that is is being undertaken through the chair in regard to what well um just and we don 't put that in this report right i 'm just wondering do will we be getting through right reports on the fluoride station on that side of it um through the chair a day um only if there was an error or if there was a something that 's occurred in the in the system under the water report we would report on that okay since last year i would have thought that there would be a formality of some kind of report in relation to that as well through the chair we have to report to the regulator that we stayed about what we provide but there 's no reporting that we do locally that 's why you might recognize that there are a lot of chemicals go into a water treatment plant and fluoride is one part per million um there are and you probably you haven 't_''_12162.8 done up there have you the water there are amazing number of chemicals that go into town water and we don 't report them uh except by exceptions my understanding there is um but i was just on the water treatment side of things in the future perhaps it depends on what the purpose is well because we 're councillors and we 'd like to know what goes into our water system i suppose uh we 're regulated by new south wales water and they you can get reports we can get reports through them um through the chair i 'll take that on notice because i don 't know where they are all right uh anyone else for water and sewer all right i 'll put the motion that uh sport 9007 is received with information yes um 1408 monthly update of the status of council of resolutions and the report item 1408 is received at the information move in a second council tucker [Music] thank you very much or nothing thank you mr mayor um just in going through this monthly update um the first item which is on page 116 the oberon waste depot um [Music] i thought there were a few things from one two and four that were still outstanding but um [Music] in relation to the jsrs report but um including um with um [Music] talking about short term medium term and long term or are you going to provide us with an update status report on april on those through the chair that 's correct the report that 's coming before council maple will have that update here [Music] okay if we could just go through that and obviously we hope to have a few other bits of information as discussed earlier in your report the draft this draft plan of the management council reserves which is on page 118 the 20th of july 21 resolution um this seems to have been with the minister for at least six months is that correct through the chair yes that 's the case um is every other council having the same problem with their crown management reserves because it 's a draft plan that every council has to do and was asked to do by the government so if you 're if you can think back that far council you 'll also note that um it needed to be done by june last year exactly yeah in june last year the state don 't need them for another two years oh okay i 'd forgotten that we 'd already engaged undertaken done the consultation we said well no we 're not going to hold off for two years we 're going to put front and center and say provide it to us but as predicted nothing 's come back at this point in time okay the next item on the oberon sports complex the jrpp [Music] the finalization of the report has has that occurred i think we were still waiting on on extra stuff from borga this ben 's has been going on going for about at least three months if not longer some information for borgs very soon that 's been the case for the last two months at least if not longer that is the case and have borg been made aware that they are delaying the jrpp approval only every week in writing i assume right in writing okay um is it something [Music] that the new or that that should be pushed up to the mayor to take on with mr ball personally i 'd strongly advise towards an external organization to assess all we 're doing is asking board to provide the information that they 've been asked for there 's no not getting involved in the jrpt determination i 'm happy to take that on board um i 'll leave that to you uh mr mayor but this has been going on so long i think has been and i am very aware that there has been a significant number of requests to ball and i have said it will be here next week or the week after and it hasn 't turned up so i 'm asking whether in your position you should be approaching mr ball directly to say what is happening here this is delaying something that we are meant to be working on together we 're not approaching the jrpp we 're approaching borg is meant to be providing the information so the jrpp can make a determination correct so i would i would suggest that it needs that maybe some mayor to mr borg is probably necessary at this stage and i said that i that i shall be doing but next week is probably an opportunity to do so if he 's around okay thank you um i think um that 's all the matters that i i 'll raise thank you very much i 'm very happy to recommend this report accidentally and uh but no i have no comments or questions thank you mr thank you uh council mccarthy and this is the one uh three instamail that andrew spoke about is there two items one the requirement to get the sports conflicts approved through the jrpg and then hasn 't mr board submitted that he 'd like to change the concept plan isn 't there two different matters here you 're the general manager what i 'm getting at is generally chair i 'm happy to go into confidential and discuss these matters where the resolution lies well what i 'm getting at is why hasn 't the jp proved that plan we were led to believe it was going to be improved in january before this modification of that concept plan was [Music] so was the plan submitted to the incomplete well it 's got d a matter that you need to work through and you 're working with external authorities that that you need to appease like they the rms or whatever they call themselves this week transport for new south wales was one of those yes so who else was there essential energy okay is there any i think that 's the two main ones anyway wouldn 't the one with essential energy been picked should have been picked up years ago when we first started this through the chair i was advised what those issues are okay all right i 'll move on um time so where it 's up to and who 's the consultant yep through the chair i 'll be bringing back a report on those two things okay thank you anymore partial road reconstruction report 1401 as you see this information the drive mover and secretary councillor hayden council mccarthy i 'm happy to move this report it it 's quite extensive but it gives a little bit of an input into what went on with that new subdivision out the road and some of the things that have had to be made on the road and looking at the figures i feel that they are acceptable figures and they 're not too extraordinary as ones for previously oh yeah like it 's it 's good to get this repaired it 's disappointing that we don 't aren 't building roads that should have a 50-year life cycle this this shooting repair fell apart so early and i don 't think around the woods yet i think the straight part off the crumby o 'connell road down the bottom end is going to fall apart but um new eight this is given a bit of hope for the people down there that i think they 've got the da approved last thursday and hoping to move forward is that correct anyway it doesn 't matter but anyway and i think there 's another one house pending and approval so yeah these people can confident be confident now they can get material on the site where before they couldn 't get brick trucks or anything in there because thank you all right councilman um thank you mr mayor um 'm wondering what lessons learned can be uh grasped from what has happened on humphrey 's lane and i think that uh councillor hayden touched on it and what we can do to ensure where there are rural residential subdivisions with road pavement design and then construction of that road i understand that this work was originally done not by council but by the developer is that correct or not that was correct so how can we ensure better quality from developers in their road construction that doesn 't come back and hit council with having to rehabilitate are we able to put long-term defect rectification periods of 10 years or late defect provisions for 10 years on these developers so that they are liable for their roads for a longer period of time this was just out of the warranty period i think the way the way you do that is by stringent quality control of both the design and construction of the road at all stages so that it is designed and constructed to the standards required by council and that clearly didn 't happen with this particular learned here and the first one is the council not to resolve to vary the width of standards against against otherwise council staff recommendations i 'll throw that one in in terms of uh how do we get to this point what are the lessons learnt because those sort of things don 't assist in this in this regard either now there are a number of applications and modifications in this in this space and um yep i agree that there are some lessons that need to be learned but they need to be learned across the board not just from a staff perspective so so could i ask could i ask that and i don 't know whether this is appropriate as a amendment to this recommendation i think i 'll discuss the concept that out of this some recommend we we have some lessons learned derived from this and i would also suggest that we consider increasing the defect liability period or latent defect liability periods as well on road construction done by by our by private companies that we come out with with a with a with project and that we look at ensuring that those lessons learned are pushed through our technical services department as well as brought back to council noting that what the general managers comment in the deter that a resolution by council to reduce the width may have had implications also for the quality and longevity of this road we don 't want this to happen again it 's cost sixty thousand dollars now it 'll probably continue to cost us into the future this is exactly what we don 't want is recurring recur current costs like this hitting our budget councilman kevin i i think i agree with you um i think we can spend a lot of time dealing with a report for information when what we should be doing is seeking a and not by resolution at this stage i don 't want to go through all that but seeking a policy on those developer roads and the processes that should be put in place around them now that is something that will probably take a little while to develop but that that should um provide the framework building their roads that they 're built to a standard which will which will make them last for 50 years and not fall apart in eight years okay so is it appropriate that we just uh amend to add a and i know we talked about just to say that um um a report be prepared on setting emanating from this issue that sets out future requirements on development developers for the construction of roads i think we need to we need to spend some time working out how to do what that 's going to look like yes i 'm not i 'm i 'm not suggesting that we i 'm just making us that that that i 'm just suggesting that the recommendation would be that the the report be developed to provide some guidelines i 'm not suggesting what the guidelines are at this stage so you 're going to move that as an amendment i am yes just quickly i 'm keeping it simple and i 'm not at this stage putting a timeline on it um though obviously we 'd assume it could be back um i through the chair enough to discuss it with uh my technical services director and what that means because putting standards on road design isn 't just saying standard there 's a quite a bit in that isn 't that something we should be putting through policies and procedures but why are we putting that now on a report that 's just basically uh to make it happen just to make it happen and i won 't put a timeline it 'll just sit in the in the resolutions thing and but i 'd like obviously because it could take some time to do i appreciate it unless you want to move it to the works committee as an issue for that i don 't you know that 's probably where we 'll deal with it i think that 's pretty sick i 'm happy for that as long as it 's put on the agenda for the next works committee meeting please well maybe it might be the next one well it can be on the agenda and then it it would be a resolution of that works you what do you want to say sorry um that a report or that a report be prepared detailing guidelines for developers in the construction of roads or future consideration by the works committee i just booked my council of my council all right yeah for future consideration for future consideration i have a second one we 've got a seconder yep well well if you 've been you 're change to that amendment you know if if council mckinnon is happy with it one of the points i was going to raise is just to what extent the the limitations within our current dcp may have contributed to this problem yes and wondering if there 's some way we can incorporate in that second in point two that uh we also look at the current dcp and what changes so through the chair based on that that resolution now that 's the way we 'll be attacking the the regardless if that makes sense okay so so that 's the mechanism in which we 'll use okay that 's i was uh i i certainly anticipate that was probably that could have contributed this a problem are the things we also need to look at and trying to get rid of all all right so do you want to speak to the any further counsel no no no i don 't um i don 't know mr mayor i think it 's uh clear what i i 'm leaving quite a bit of discretion to the general manager i just think we we need to capture lessons learned and learn from them where possible agree you 're fine no i 'm trying anyone else we should speak for or against this all right i 'll put the amendments the report are you wishing to talk or you 're already voting i 'm voting guidelines for developers in the construction of roads for future consideration by council all in favor all right the motion sorry the amendment has been uh seen uh passed it now becomes the motion the motion is that report item 1409 has received information and uh and the report being prepared detailing guidelines for developers in the construction of roads uh for future consideration by council further discussion at this point because there 's a couple of other questions i had only on the original report uh yeah i thought we 'd already the amendment becomes the motion we 've already spoken with emotion by everyone who had the opportunity well you did you 're seconded yes we 've spoken on the amendment but not everyone had had a chance to speak on the original motion i have a couple certain questions i might be getting the process well the original motion was just for information yes and i had some questions relating to that um i think you 've missed the boat actually so well yeah most of them i was going to do that anyway because i 've got quite a few and uh i don 't want to waste everyone 's time so the motion has been passed it 's now big sorry the members has been passed it now becomes emotion all in favor against none right [Music] there 's no urgent business and we 're now going to go into a into a closed session um i need a mover and and councilman gibbons in accordance with the local government acts 1993 in the local government general regulation 2005 in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kind as referred to in section 102 a two of the acts i 'm sorry 1010a2 of the act and should be dealt with in a part of the meeting close to the media and the public so at this point um so we 've been moved into confidential so it stopped okay we 're recording in accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government 's general regulation 2005 uh sorry my my apologies i 've got that wrong all right the following resolutions were made during the section of the meeting that was closed the public there were no members of the public presence at that time with regard to mata 1601 or water write-off request account number one two three six one nine two six the council resolved to not write off the excess water for assessment one two three six six but instead offer a payment plan arrangement for full cost recovery relations of abercrombie and campbell 's river road at black springs the council the resolution is that council whilst generally supporting of the proposal defer any decision of the sale of the land parcel on the corner of abercrombie and campbell 's river road to allow the prospective partner to submit further details of their proposal to council after which a further report will be presented with relation to item request for water rates repayment uh oberon council has approved the request from the owner of 27 to 29 albion street for the repayment of water rates used during the covert 19 pop-up drive-through testing facility to the value of four thousand one hundred and twelve dollars and thirty one cents to be paid from the twenty one twenty-two covered 19 funds with regard to item 1604 electricity procurement the council resolved to note the report on electricity procurement note that a reduced tender period has been considered resolved that because of the extenuating circumstances set out in the report a satisfactory result would not be achieved by inviting attenders for the aggregated procurement electricity for large markets for large market the 1st of january 2023 note that the reasons for the decision of council in resolution 3 are as follows the services with respect to which the tender rates can only be provided by energy retailers council has received expert advice that due to the nature of the relevant markets offers from those retailers which will be made in response to the request for tender will only be open for acceptance for a period of one to two weeks even if the tender period was shortened to seven days as permitted under the regulations some if not all of the relevant tenders would expire prior to council being able to undertake an assessment of tenders report the matter to council and resolve to accept any or reject any tenders this would result in council either having no valid tenders which is which it is able to accept or it would not be able to consider for acceptance all of the tenders lodged in response to the request for gender this would not be so this would not be a satisfactory result of the council or further resolved to delegate the for large market sites and street lighting to the general manager and advise the new south wales central new south wales joint organization of council 's decisions at 10 27 uh i closed the meeting thank you councillors and thank you those who are attending by then including you _"

Jim any other council McCarthy what about to tell committee in 3 2 3 as well we concentrate counselor tell committee traffic committee committee yep in 3 2 3 yeah that 's the statuary statutory committee I don 't know that it would go into members of the public personally participating in policy development I don 't think that would come under 3 2 3 Oh put it up in 3 2 way through that through the chair talc is an advisory committee off council it gives that boy like there are members of the council I believe it probably does sit in that council committees section of the of the of the guide so my more than happy to if not I 'm going to put the recommendation that the agency information guide 2020 21 be adopted as represented in this report with those additions all in favor carried thank you age 29 you hear me yes counselor Donny I can 't hear you Elsa Tony 's mood muted I can 't hear what he 's saying cancer Danny I can 't hear you you can hear me now yes that 's good I 'm sorry I 'll just been having a few computer problems I think I 'm alright now thanks very much for your patience Thank You counselor page 29 counselors item CTA audit and Risk Improvement Committee there 's a recommendation in three parts that the report item Oh 402 be received as information noting the minutes from the central tablelands Alliance audit and risk Improvement Committee meetings held on the 17th of March 2020 that philip roth 's be appointed as the third independent member of the central table like tablelands Alliance audit and Risk Improvement Committee and that the amended central tablelands Alliance audit and Risk Improvement Committee charter be adopted and I have you a seconder counselors phase Council McCarthy Thank You councillor Callum do you wish to speak to the wreckage of the recommendation just briefly madam mayor the new independent member we did the selection panel about ten days ago mr. Ross is an extraordinarily well qualified member he has a doctorate in accounting amongst other things and has served on all committee 's large and small for some significant time one other candidate was also almost as well qualified and and there was a little bit of a toss-up for a while between the two but mr. Ross won out the Charter is meant few amendments to the original charter to allow for the extra members and other ministry moderate administrative changes Thank You counselor councillor McCarthy do you wish to speak no it 's a straightforward report thank you Thank You counselor any other comments on this one counselors first counsel McKibben thank you madam mayor through you I was wondering if we 've had any further feedback on our submission in relation to the internal audit committees and the government 's New South Wales government 's response that members what is it going to cost over on a year with the current arrangements Thank You councillor as for the first one of your points we have not yet received any response to the submission I think that there were more submissions entered than they anticipated and it 's taking some time I would have to defer to the general manager for the second part of your question place thank you madam mayor current budget allocation is 25,000 dollars that covers over on councils component of the total Eric committee unless my corporate services director would like to state otherwise no that 's correct thank you if that it comes from McKibben any other comments councillors I 'm going to put the recommendation in three parts all in favor carried unanimously thank you 853 councillors item Oh 403 covered 19 update there 's a recommendation councillors in four parts that the report item Oh 403 B receivers information and the actions taken to date be noted that businesses who pay council rent slash lease be offered an option for deferral of payments for six months in accordance with the they apply point three that the seven point five percent interest rate charged on overdue rates be waived for rate payers who fall behind in rates or water sewer charges due to loss of income as a result of the Coburg 19 pandemic and that council consider any rate levee assistance as part of its 2020 21 operational plan can I have a mover for those recommendations please councillors councillor Kellerman Council McKibben Thank You councillor Callan would you like to speak to this report better met the item two there are several businesses of pious lease fees and it is entirely appropriate that we act in accordance with the federal government 's direction in terms of relief for that and I equally agree that deferring interest rate for people who fall behind in their rates of water and sewerage through its charge is equally as reasonable and and we need to consider rate levee assistance as part of the operational plan because we need to make sure we have an appropriate income and and have to understand clearly what changes to our income this will cause so that we You councillor castle McKibben do you wish to speak to this report yet hmm well in principle I agree with each of the four recommendations I am just wondering with a lot of these things how we 're objectively going to assess some of these these things because some businesses are obviously being affected a lot more than by Cova dine pain than others and in respect to the 7.5 percent interest rate how how weenus there are certain businesses that are probably be clear there 's be a loss of income as a result of covert 19 pandemic because they are businesses that have either had to close or if their restaurants or cafes can only do takeaway and it 's reasonably objective to see I 'm just wondering if we have some how we 're going to assess the criteria in rice and two in particular three and again are all the businesses who rent from council going to be equally affected in respect to the covert 19 or all some may remain basically unaffected if we as the general manager thought as to how we can assess thank you who the mayor I 'm happy to defer to corporate services director to update on how that proposal will would be considered because it certainly has been considered humanity in relation to number three the 7.5 percent interest rate charge is will be dealt with on a hardship through the hardship policy on a case-by-case so it 's not only for businesses but it 's for all ratepayers in relation to number two yes there will be some businesses that I don 't we that can deal with this some covert better than others but it will be once again on a case-by-case basis and we do that now under our hardship policy in place through the chair number two has a has another adjunct to that and that is should they apply for the federal funding so there is another requirement for for those users so they don 't have to it 's just a secondary measure and it 's the reason why we put should they apply at the back of the second recommendation thank you anyone else before I go back to Council McKibben counselling there be a starting date for this what if someone 's already behind Matt Amir through you this was considered and it clearly states that it will be dealt with if it is a lot of it is due to the cove it doesn 't matter what whether it was when it first started or whether it 's now it will be as a result of the covent it is not for rate payers who have been affected by the drought or the bush fires etc in the previously this will be dealt with through the operational plan and the assessment of how we can and assist ratepayers in the future really forward it considering that we didn 't do anything for the drought and I know it 's true but I just think there should be a starting day to this say fed into February that 's that 's where my concern and one of the businesses is my concern that I thought was a vine they have a house throwing in with their lease and I I think the cost of the house is what the lease is a house over ten the cost of the lease of this council function is half of what you 'd be fine for a rental house as this is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis councillor McCarthy I 'm sure that this will be taken up into consideration by the director am I correct that is correct and with regard to the date I 'm happy to be guided by council 4.3 okay I 'm to be guided by counselors counselors counsel mcafee well I personally think it should have a starting date because then it it takes it away from the staff that someone comes along and no bleeding in their handkerchief but they were able to fulfill they think I understand the businesses are shut down that 's totally different but I think there should be a starting David say into February or something like that what a brazen amendment counselor now just putting it out there to see the two movers might change it I 'll go back to counselor Keller mr. muda I think I have no inherent objection to having a date put in there this some in this case on on number two is that there are only a couple of organizations at least property from the council and that is not difficult to deal with Allison McKibben as a second Thank You mayor I 'm sort of tend to agree with counselor killer moe I think there 's only several to businesses or through basically we 're dealing with and it 's going to be dealt with similar to hardship and as I understand it and correct me if I 'm wrong it 's a deferral for six months and is it then have to be paid after six months or as the federal government reimbursing for that six months it 's well I 'm not clear I thought the federal government was reimbursing for some of the rental deferral and they would have to catch up unless they apply for the government subsidy and say achieve a reimbursement for that that 's what I thought yes thank you thank you any other comments on this one thing councillors know something about a different issue I 'm just wondering from a budgetary point at a budget as to what we think the ambit of these four recommendations could possibly cost council or a range so that we have some idea I I would think that would be quite difficult because we don 't really know the volume of applications or because they 'd be one or whether they 'd be 50 I 'm sure that maybe when the operational plan gets put together we might get a better idea manager I would I have deferred from putting this is not being discussed as a confidential manner and we will address it as part of the operational plan with some estimates for the covert funding Thank You counsel McKibben um I mean I support the four recommendations I 've said the only problem with is that I think it 's prudent on counselors to at least be aware of what it might cost us before we actually prove these recommendations I mean I think we sort of can 't_''_1443.46 write a blank check we should have at least an indication of the possible financial parameters we 're talking about here I just you know should be but I think we should have some idea of what financially and the impacts going to be I realized that it will only be an estimate at best but I think we should at least have an estimate I understand that that may be confidential but I just feel that counselors should be made aware of it before we approve it can I ask through the general manager is there an estimate if we defer this into confidential at this point in time is there an estimate at this point in time or it 's completely subjective because some of the some of the rate payers might and might apply for it it 's very difficult for us to give a an estimate I 'm happy to defer to their corporate services director if they have some undertaking we are certainly looking at Co the budgeting for 2021 but to give an estimate for the remainder of 1920s is difficult to limit to provide any other information thank you is there any other information you can provide director if there is concern perhaps number two might want to the operational plan okay there 's the options there that wouldn 't that would require an amendment take out number two and defer it to the operational plan discussions which will happen in June if there is an amendment to be raised he says someone to raise it cancel transfer Donny are you raising an amendment no madam mayor I 'm trying to make a comment okay yeah I 'm just clarification where it says deferral of payments for people who may have suffered lots of income I mean this is going to cover both businesses and private individuals I assume correct me if I 'm wrong and I 'm thinking that 's I appreciate counsel McKibben 's point but I find that extremely hard to estimate as to you know we 're talking about hospitality workers we 're talking about all sorts of people I find it really difficult as how we would estimate the cost of this venture at this point if if my understanding is correct that it is both commercial and individual could not clarify that is counselor Dhoni talking about number two or number three the for number three I 'm happy to do that because the 7.5 interest rates charged on rates is well under 500 it 's not a huge amount it is basically deferring the impose ment of that interest rate while they while they have until they make their rate payments and there 's what we 're deferring in point three it is not the deferral of the actual rates is the deferral of the interest rate on those late fees thank you madam ma 'am thank you councillor McCarthy on item through he doesn 't say that they be waived in other words they they don 't have to pay it the interest rates will be waived yes interest rate would be waived to the interest component and not the rates I understand that but all I 'm saying is the cable that we 're dealing with Cove at nineteen update its it started in February didn 't it if end of February impacted on us right well if someone comes to cancel and then they say you know I 've had it impacted since October that 's all I it I think this work this was where the case by case basis assessment will come in can some okay I 'm just not happy with it anyway thank you okay any other comments councillors before I put this recommendation counselor Gibbons counselor Gibbons we 're not hearing your counselor Gibbons just one moment mr. Gibbons could you please unmute yourself down the bottom menu it 's not allowing me to do it from here on there 'll be a picture of a speaker put the line through it if you just select that place [Music] I 'm sorry madam mayor I cannot I 'm a mute there you go cause it is you yep we can hear you counselor yeah I just failed for considering trying to estimate budgets and that on a bit inclined to agree with counsel McCarthy if if there was a starting date where the lockdown began or where particularly that 's for businesses where they started to go downhill and it 's affected just about everyone up in the main strip so I don 't know with that a consideration to try and have to business and a budget Thank You counselor well I have asked the mover and seconder if they wish to change their recommendation or accept that as part of the recommendation and they were not so were taken amendment counselors this is someone that wants to move in a member to get this up councillor Killam the I remember I would suggest is that we we do defer point to to the main meeting noting it is only to business we 're talking about which would leave it leaves the recommendation is item one currently items three and four and I 'd also note that as far as budgeting for deferred rates and the 7.5 percent surcharge goes you can 't possibly understand how many people are not going to pay and it 's not money we 're losing its money we are simply choosing not to levy so it won 't it won 't significantly affect the council 's budget and it will aid a number of people significantly Thank You councillor Stella is there somebody in moving any amendment here councilors if not I 'm going to put in four parts councilors all in favor one two three four five six seven eight carried unanimously thank you counselors and I know closed session reports this evening counselors we 're on page 64 is there any general Business Council McCarthy yes madam mayor I have a couple are we still looking forward to a balanced budget at the end of the financial year where we had the protected projected 2000 dollars surplus through the general manager I 'll defer to the director of corporate many we are currently assessing the quarter three budget review as we speak I do not have that finalized for the May meeting and we are anticipating a balanced budget but we cannot guarantee it with the extra expenditure that has been spent thank you comes from McCarthy is that return on our investment for the rental houses once been sitting there vacant since Christmas I remember Andrew McKibben saying that it was a good investment but it 's not good if the unless the houses are full through the general manager yeah Matt Amir as counsel also be aware is that we 've just initially indicated by the successful applicant that they were going to take that house since that point they have now decided to go somewhere else and that house is being put on the market as we speak thank you anything else comes from Council McCarthy thought the on the interview of the person opted to go somewhere else from from the word scratch but anyway I 'll be taking on those um did we sell the new slasher that replaced the mower when it was breaking them was the significant amount of money to go by on you knew slash a wall of moles broken down so where 's the new slashers have been sold or sitting in a shed with no tractor to drive it through the general manager the tech services director here through the chair certainly we have both pieces of equipment available to us we had the the moral component and we we had to purchase a slasher so we we have both still at out at our beck and call okay thank you and the last one is where the 40,000 end up from the money to finish that office it 's there at the tip just have been to the general manager yeah I could defer to the 40,000 to the director however the money for the the relocation of the the pound has been acquittal accounted for within the current waste budget so it 's there I would defer to the corporate services director about the scrap metal scrap metal money has been returned into the waste fund excuse me Thank You counsel McCarthy you said it went winds the projects that the tip gonna be completed then to the general manager through the chair our current director is looking at those projects as we speak Thank You counsel McCarthy is that it for you oh I 'm not happy with the explanation but anyway I have to sit venire thank you thank you there any other general business today councillor McKibben Humana man I thought last time we budget we were actually looking for looking at a small deficit at the end of the year therefore I 'm a little the comments thus far oh we were looking at now looking at looked at it it was acknowledged there was likely to be a small deficit for the director [Music] that is correct Kuban we are and we were anticipating a small deficit we did say at the time that we were confident that we could bring that back and that will depend on the work that we have obtained to do that during that period the external work you mean that is correct Thank you Thank You counselors is there no other general business I 'm going to close the meeting at 15 Thank You counselors _"

on council 's website and persons attending the meeting should refrain from making any definitions council acknowledges that this meeting is being held on the traditional lands of wiradjuri gandangara and people and respect the history and culture of the elders both past and present ken would you like to i 'm not a traditional practicing christian that way but uh i do have some interpretations of of christian behavior and i think if we do the best we can with the information and the tools that we 're given we look after each other and we treat each other with respect we 'll leave every thing we do in a better place and a better condition for the people that follow us thank you thank and record of attendance is there we have a presentation this evening from john o 'malley from uh intentis and he 'll present a summary of council 2021 ordered in financial statements [Music] thank you mr man thank you john when you 're ready okay i 'm not sure i 'm presuming there 's some slides which should be up to accompany this um so i 'll run through those what i 'm briefly going to cover is uh is just a high level view of the the financial statement audit for the 2021 year by way of background uh i 'm on base in orange we 're a firm that 's sort of in the central west bathurst and orange but where they 're contract agents to the new south wales audit office who are the the auditors of the council so we we do their leg work we recommend to them what opinions should be issued write the reports but they come out from the auditor general so that 's the process similarly in our reporting back to council tonight they sort of um have influence over what it 's expressed so that 's it i 'll move into the presentation um this second slide is is just a bit of an outline of what work the order office is currently undertaking because apart from the the audits of all of the councils in the state they also undertake a number of what 's known as performance audits which is looking more at the efficiency and effectiveness of certain uh entities uh i guess in the last few days we 've seen a report issued on the uh how grants have been delivered across the state we 've also seen one on the transport rail uh the rail transport holding entity which has also been very topical the ones focused around local government haven 't garnered as many headlines and and i think we can probably all uh breathe some relief at that because you 'd prefer not to be in the gays the focus of their 2021 or 22 performance audits was around the uh the response the recovery in the impact for natural disasters so coming off the back of the uh the bushfires in the know with the covet pandemic it was fairly topical uh area for them to focus on so the reports from that will start to flow through uh individually actually from this month on to the next slide uh the focus that they 've got for the the current financial year um is is that they will group their findings in the management letter themes so the things that we 've been reporting back individually to the council they 'll work up into some themes for their report which is uh also due to be issued so they as a sector they issue a report on all the local government audits uh in one hit and they do that their original plan was to have that out in december that that didn 't happen um and and i 'm understanding that that report 's due to be issued in any number of days the key focus areas they 've got there hasn 't been a great deal of change cyber risk is is remaining very much a uh a key focus and and hand-in-hand with that is the information technology controls is the transition to the new arrangements for audit committees that 'll um uh kick in this year um so that 's that 's the areas they 're looking at having covered those though i 'll shift to the next slide which is where we start to look at more specifically at the financial statements for oberon so next one again please so the things that were significant in the the 2021 year in the oberon financial statements we had the ongoing impact of covert and you know that certainly required some um thinking on on the fly and changing the way the council delivered its services uh some weren 't able to be delivered in traditional means uh there was changes in how the staff were working with the increased remote working um and so that had a continued ongoing impact as it will going into this year i think we 're only now just starting to get back to a point where it 's some sort of normality although of course uh it 's it 's good to see that you 're able to have the the meeting not out of this yet by a long shot in terms of new accounting standards uh the the standards which apply to local government are the same as what applies to international companies there 's there 's no differentiation we we have to apply the same set of accounting standards um thankfully though there weren 't any in the 2021 financial year that had a significant impact on the financial statements the year before we had a couple came in that were dealing with uh revenue recognition and uh and lease accounting um last year there was one which related to service arrangements but it didn 't have any impact on council and in in the wings there 's nothing for the 2022 year so we 've actually had a couple of years of of a relative calm on that front which is good we we do have the situation because we 're subject to the same international accounting standards at least every three to five years council has to re-value their infrastructure assets it 's it 's one of the frustrating outcomes because you 've got a business in in the value of your assets doesn 't really have much impact upon you know well you don 't have a market value you 're in the business of service delivery and you need the infrastructure assets to you know provide facilities to your community but the the change in value of those services doesn 't really uh matter much but the way that the standards work you 've still got to revalue them so last year we had the evaluation of operational land community demand and other structures and open space assets so those are things like uh play equipment uh you know cricket pitchers and sporting fields uh those sorts of things as well as the community land you know the parks and and reserves and operational land which is land held by council for operational purposes the upshot of all that was a five and a half million dollar net increase in their carrying value that was partially offset by a an impairment which is to say that the the service potential of some of your assets were decreased uh and that was to your roads network storms it was snow and flooding uh that caused damage to the road network so there was an impairment recorded against those so there was a net increase in your assets of around about 4.2 million last year following their evaluations one of the the unfortunate corollaries of that though is that the uh sorry just kill that the um the value in the assets goes up we we have to uh under the accounting rules right assets off over their useful life and that process is known as depreciation so when we say that we 've got a road and it 's going to last for 20 years over each each year for those 20 years we recognize in round terms one twentieth of its value it works a little differently because it doesn 't deteriorate in a straight line but um that that 's effectively what we 're doing and because the the road value uh increase uh on on the back of the previous year 's valuations our depreciation expense this year or for the 2021 year increased um so it was four million dollars in in in the 2021 year so that 's the the downside in the changing asset values um next slide please as the slides changing if if you 've got questions or you 'd like me to explain something further please jump in happy to do those as we 're dealing with them or to take them at the end which ever suits so the operating results so i guess the the bottom line on the income statement uh was that we had a surplus both before and after capital amounts and oberon 's probably among one of the relative few smaller country councils who are able to achieve an operating uh surplus the depreciation of infrastructure has seen a lot of them dip into deficit you can see that last year we did have a deficit before capital amounts but we look at it in in two slices we look at the operating result before capital amounts which in this case was a surplus of just 66 000 and we look at the operating surplus after capital amounts which was just under nine million uh and and that really illustrates the receipt of last year uh almost double you know any of the preceding four years and uh and certainly had a massive impact on your your result next slide please so looking then this is is council 's revenue and what i 've done is i 've taken your income statement i 've taken the income areas and just graphed them um but where your income statement only gives you a comparative period of one year i 've given you four years to give you a bit of a an opportunity to see whether there 's any themes or standouts in there and and try and pick the eyes out of it that way so you can see on on rates income and certainly not any any uh massive gains uh in in that regard council did previously have a special rate variation in play with ipark so you were able to move your rate increases beyond the the rate pig amount but um nonetheless you can still see that in in the five-year period we 've moved from you know 3.97 to 4.6 million so we 've moved you years so it 's it 's still in real terms not significant jumps on on your your income it 's just the steady growth operating grants and contributions tend to be a bit more um stable from year to year we can see a little bit of movement there it was boosted because of that uh the damage that was um occurred to your road network you actually received a grant to repair the damage that was caused at 1.6 million so that boosted your operating grants uh up above where they 'd been historically over the previous few years capital grants though is the real story of the 2021 year you can see that it 's at just under 9 million uh they 're you know why way in excess of any of the previous years so the the amount of capital funding has been quite extraordinary um 4.7 million of that was for for you know specifically for fixing country roads we had 1.4 million for community infrastructure and the additional an additional 1.6 million in in funding from the roads and maritime services user charges and fees annual waste uh charges that council uh sorry not the annual the collection charges of waste that council levies so they tend to move a bit more like rates the other thing that it can include though is work that you do for third parties which includes the state government rather than maritime services so the the one thing that does tend to bump that up is is if you pick up more work on rms roads um then is the norman i suspect that was the case in the 2019 year last year was more in keeping with the previous years annual charges are the access charges that council levies to to have access to water and sewer facilities and to have the annual charge for the the rubbish collection interest revenue uh has been tapering off everyone 's pretty familiar with the fact that we 've been in a very low interest rate environment for a prolonged period so even though council has grown the amount of money it 's got invested the the interest revenue that 's being uh paid on that uh is is declining and placed back when interest rates were a bit more attractive roll off and have to be renewed at the the current market prevailing rates and then other income is made up of bits and pieces like rent and the the proceeds on disposal of plant and equipment so total income uh you can see was uh significantly higher at 28.475 million compared to 19 million in the previous year but the the true story the whole story of that is is largely in capital grants next slide please so this is the other side of the income statement your expenses uh and you can see here we 've broken it up again giving you four years of comparison and and in some broad headings so employee costs it 's um it 's a little bit needs a little bit of context when you look at that one the employee costs includes all sorts of costs of employment so training workers compensation superannuation um and then the other thing which which causes that to swim to swing from year to year is the amount of capital work that we 're doing of that labor goes into the value of the asset if we 're doing maintenance work it goes as an expense so typically when your wages cost is uh is up it 's it 's because you 're doing more maintenance work and that was certainly uh the case last year there was also some some increase in the costs of your workers compensation premiums last year and if it 's down it tends to be more when councils you know working on the construction of assets so uh the best way to to sort of see the underlying wages figure is to go to the uh the notes to the accounts uh which provide a bigger breakdown and show how much of the wages expense has been capitalized or not material costs uh again are a bit the same if we 're doing a lot of maintenance we tend to use a lot of materials if we 're building assets then then the the the cost goes into the asset um but this this year it was pretty comparable with the prior year coming in at 6.87 million compared it 's it 's jumped up markedly it was hovering around that 3.6 mark 3.9 you know the previous two years and then with the revaluation of the transport assets it 's gone up by about uh you know a million dollars in round terms and in the city now over the five million dollar mark borrowing costs which is the uh interest component of the the borrowings was fairly low i 'll touch on that a little later but one of the reasons for that too is that some borrowings which were drawn down and which will show up in in as bearing as as borrowed were drawn down on the 26th of june so there was no interest cost to council in in having them for that amount of time which once when you see the growth in borrowings it 's a little counter-intuitive that the borrowing cost is down but that 's the reason and then other costs is taking in all sorts of things like your insurances and utilities and those sort of things and uh and sitting at 1.3 million so total expenses for uh a half million up from 18 million the year before and again the depreciation being the biggest contributor to that increase next slide please so the cash position of council you can see i mentioned that there was more cash and and quite a bit of that is off the back of you know both drawing down the loan at the end of the financial year and also receiving more grant funding uh so council had 25.8 million in in cash compared to 17.7 uh the the majority of that 15 million of it was uh externally restricted and i 'll touch on that in the next slide but um the the the way that council 's money is is that it 's either internally restricted or externally restricted so internal restrictions the council adopts the management plan and says we 're going to do these future things and this is how we 're going to pay for it and so it effectively puts the money in jam jars and says here 's how that money will be used you can change the purpose of the restriction but it involves um so there 's there 's limited flexibility in that external restrictions as the name suggests is there 's less flexibility so this is things like unexpended grants um or water or sewer money where it can only be used for water or serve purposes it can 't_''_1164.32 be used to go out and construct a carpark dragon and say and similarly if you receive a grant to to build a bridge you can 't use that for sporting facilities so that externally restrict your money it 's terrific to have it always happy to see lots of externally restricted cash it means you 've got things in the pipeline but the the downside is that you you can 't uh divert the you know the purpose of that money so the next slide one of the things is that in previous years the the cash was broken up into three components the external restrictions the internal restrictions and the unrestricted because council is a business like any other and needs some buffer to ride the ebb and flow of when money money 's coming in and being paid out cash and if you eat into your externally restricted you 're in breach of the act so we definitely want to avoid that so the buffer is the unrestricted cash it previously was reported in the financial statements but there were some changes brought in last year and it was no longer reported i 've been naughty and thrown it into this graph because i think it 's important to know how much buffer do we have and you can see it 's saturday 895 000 not quite as much as the previous year so although we 've got more cash overall uh then than we did the previous year we actually have a little bit less unrestricted nonetheless you know i think 895 is is you know what was because we 're talking about something that 's now nearly seven months ago uh yeah was was sufficient buffer at the time you can see back in 2018 and 2019 that was much less the case and you 're you 're very uh tight as far as not having any flexibility so it is desirable to keep some some you cash next slide person a little on what council did as far as plant equipment replacements and and renewal in terms of renewal what we 're talking about there is is taking existing infrastructure and bringing it back to as new conditions so you can imagine that much of that is to do with roads and and you know certainly that was the case last year um we renewed eight million dollars of assets last year compared to 3.3 most of that was roads but then there was the aged accommodation and the water fluoridation equipment um although sorry that would have been that um the fluoridation equipment is actually a new edition rather than a renewal new assets were 2.6 million and up from you know double the previous year so quite a big capital works program going on last year and that 's running into this year too next slide in terms of the external debt um the borrowings at 30 june stood at 5.3 million up from 2.8 million in the previous year as i was saying that that 3 million loan for the sewer treatment plant was both unexpended and unrepaid you know there hadn 't been installments paid on that this year um the repayments were 504 000 in the 2021 year up from 484 000 in the 2020 year so you can see that the the repayments will increase in the 2022 year off the back of the new borrowings for the sewer treatment plant uh john i 'll have a plan okay one of the the ratio in in the the financial statements there 's um also some ratios which are reported uh the the purpose of those i guess is to uh take the circumstances of all the councils across the state and bring them back to a common comparison and they do that over a number of measures the debt service cover ratio which they they use for that is largely saying out of our operating cash that we generate from our activities how many times over could we meet our debt servicing obligations um and obviously the higher the number the better 2021 like i say it 's a little bit of an anomaly because we had the the uh didn 't have any servicing costs associated with that so we 're sitting very comfortably on the debt service coverage um the 2022 year the expectation would be that debt service cover ratio will drop back there 's a benchmark put out by the office of local government they they they believe that it uh it shouldn 't get any lower than two percent um but you know as you can see with uh oberon sitting at 10 we were well well above that next slide please onto questions now i i did i was i was emailed a question from cancer via counsel uh from councilman mckibben i presume that 's the one you 're looking to ask andrew uh it is john but maybe maybe i could first ask another one if i can through you uh mr mayor um noting that the depreciate that the um appreciation has increased to 5.3 million this year uh sorry 5.208 million i think it was and that we ex will be expending a considerable amount on capital assets this year or probably the next couple of years that will obviously will have on our accounts i 'm noting that other councils are probably going to have the same issue well the likely impact is is uh yes a continued increase in your depreciation expense as as your asset inventory grows and like like a lot of councils it may mean that your operating result uh before capital amounts uh does does slip into the the deficit situation uh that 's that 's happened to a number of smaller councils and the the thing that needs to be remembered in that is that we 're depreciating infrastructure on the basis of if we didn 't had it have it and we had to go out and replace it what would it cost and that 's what we 're then depreciating now for mine that 's a pretty bad premise because we do have it and if we maintain our infrastructure we can we can keep providing the services to our community for considerably less than the replacement cost so unfortunately it 's one of those situations where complying with the accounting standards is actually not providing useful information in in terms expense so in future is it possible to provide the operating profits before capital before depreciation is taken into account as a separate line item so that we have a realistic figure that 's uh because as you have said in relation to councils in particular it is going to impact significantly on their results on their operating profit and will probably give a skewed view of what the realistic view is but certainly for your management accounting i mean what what you 're you 're you 're suggesting is is comparable or analogous to the ebitda figures that you might see in in corporate uh speak um and yes i mean that that 's quite commonly uh used to see what your underlying performance was um you won 't see it in the accounts that the order office or you know that we prepare for the order office because they have to be prepared in accordance with all the accounting standards but uh but i 'd certainly i 'm prepared to say in this sort of a forum that i do think that the depreciation expense can be uh 've certainly seen previous ministers come to the conclusion that councils are unsustainable uh purely off the back of depreciation when that wasn 't in fact the case fine so it wouldn 't be a problem if we if we had a separate line in our management accounts or accounts we give the community that uh refers to an ebitda or even even just excluding the depreciation rather than interest and tax as well yep the second question which i gave you some quite a bit of background uh on um is i suppose what on the basis of our debt servicing uh ratios our opera our own source operation ratio and the basis of our operating result what do you believe is the maximum level of debt that oberon could can manage in both uh on the basis of repayments of interest and on the basis of the level of debt on that one i guess i 'm i 'm bound by the audit office in terms of that they 're expressing opinion on your historical financial statements and you 're asking a prospective question on likely repayment levels opinion upon that it 's really one for uh your management to provide you the information and council to make a decision as to whether or not we 're getting uh too deep in into uh debt looking at what was on your plate uh i i guess i 'm overview that if we see uh you know alarm bells uh that that are suggesting excessive um reliance on debt then we 're able to to raise those issues i 'm not at the point of of um taking that forward with the order office because i think the combination of uh you know low interest rates that are available to to councils for infrastructure and the long term that some of those can be still locked away at uh don 't pose any sort of existential threat to you uh but on the basis of some background information i 've provided i would have thought you could give an indication of what would be acceptable debt levels because you as an auditor will have to order the financial accounts ultimately correct but but as an order to my obligation financial statements correctly show that information not whether or not it was a good decision or a bad decision unfortunately that 's more of an advisory role and and particularly for order for independence reasons we can 't audit the work that we 've provided advice on right anyone else have questions just yes is it too simplistic to say that if the aim is not to get divided 2 and that we 're now 10 that we could sustain a 5 times the level of debt and the two percent it is a bit because i mean your 10 level uh is is looking at the service costs and that you incurred during the year and the debt level that you had at the end of the year you had a an inflated level of debt at the end of the year with very low service costs because the loan was drawn down in june so that 10 outcome is is needs a little bit of of analysis to see oh okay that 's that 's higher than then the underlying situation would be if we were to do um so that would be a little bit too simplistic i 'd suggest yes any other questions come from coffee john the um treatment plant the fluoride treatment plant was by a hundred percent grant from the state government i understand um how is it that we 've got to write that off when when we didn 't actually put any money to it because it 's your it 's council 's asset now and and it 'll be council 's responsibility to uh replace the asset at the end of its useful life okay even though we didn 't put any um gross money through it that that 's true of you know a lot of your your grant funded assets but yeah you know once they become your asset the state government 's not going to give you the money for it and then say oh and and we 'll we 'll um we 'll wear the depreciation charge as well thank you any further questions all right thank you john good presentation and uh i 'm sure you saved those slides [Music] thanks very much have a of the community in accordance with the requirements under the current public health orders any questions from the public will be able to be asked in person and communities to be given an opportunity to ask questions at the commencement of the council meeting and the mayor is to ask for questions from the gallery prior to commencement and ordering me members of the public wishing to address council are permitted to do so provide providing they follow the guidelines that they adhere to the person asking the question at the council meeting must clearly state their name and in what capacity they are acting if the person is asking the questions is acting as another person 's or organization 's agent they should they must advise council if they have their prior consent and authority questions from the public is not an opportunity for debate with elected representatives or staff it is an opportunity for the community to ask questions in relation to an issue or put a point of view relating to an issue that may be causing interest or concern due to time constraints the time frame and comments must be directed through the mayor and in the instance of a question if it cannot be answered it will be taken on notice and a response given within a reasonable period of time it 's the only opportunity for the community to address for a community member to address council during an ordinary meeting do you have any questions received and received and from the gallery good evening there mark and counselors my name is keith sullivan i speak for nobody except myself uh before i start i just reiterate i don 't challenge any decision the council makes but i 'm always concerned for the longevity of this council and the manner and the act of the act it 's fine so on that basis if you give me the three minutes i 'll be happy but tonight 's council will be asked to support the setting up a working grid to oversee them overseas the project relations and proposed new sporting fields which i assume will include the expediting of an agreement to sell the current sporting films to bulge industries for one million dollars considerably having been utilized in the industry environmental markets more than 40 years invasive costs of existing facilities which would tend to be sold were valued at over five 4.5 million over 10 years ago the pricing being offered in our way it reflects the cost of replacement or the strategic location of the site section 2231c requires the governing body to ensure as far as possible financial facility of the council is they 're secure and as far as i 'm having acetone there 's not even a basic evidence that this guideline has been fired for a number of years you 've already been had seen substantial amount of money both grants and council wasted on drawings prior to the current hub proposal which is rare to be doubled and created available there have not only been basic evidence that this required being fired for many of with the sports grant will just be a continuation if it 's not stopped or addressed like the current hub project no justifiable cost has been established which was quite a normal feasibility study process neither had the concerns expressed by requirement unless changed recently for council ensure adequate funding sources are available prior to committing to the project costs as we 've been suggesting this project are half the cost of other similar projects completed elsewhere and it 's still twice the total of the conferred available funds as i understand as well as identify additional funding or the redefinition of the hub we also now have the occult maintenance of the facility being established there 's the question of the need for a new and serious transplant and they also relocation of the upgrading of our uh rubbish network to comply so we believe that probably surely these two projects should be taken prior and i believe we need to clear our desire to provide overall with the best facility to possible and aggressive need to cut the cloth for the best purpose much larger council now that have far reduced determined by the central case of vega are examples of what will occur if we do not thank you mr sullivan that 's three minutes good i just don 't ask the council to stop the current process problem ever since the developer developed the road it should never have been fast uh when you used to drive down it but the trucks and the cars would make wheel marks in it and around the council they come out and fill them up again and just lately this ended last year we had the rain and the snow drift come through the bottom of my property and they 've got three drains running off oconnell drive which whenever the rain comes it 's like a river going through there and i 've got a small dam just before it gets to hunt for his drive and the water overflows that and runs down through the next door neighbor 's place and it 's washed out the road because it comes into the road very very fast and it can 't go across so it undermined the road and that the rest of it sort of runs across the road and down the road you 've started work out there now but you haven 't put a cold on the corner of my place and the one next door no cold across the road you put a cold on my neighbor 's drive but you haven 't put a coal but across the road and you 're going to have the same problem with that much water running through there it 's going to wash the road out again it needs to cover it across the road and into the big drain you 've got on the other side so it can get away i have sent some um photos in that to council and to kell and um aiden and i met her one day on the road and i was speaking to it and um then everything started to work and i have been in here many times speaking to council and always saying i 'm going to get back to you i 'm going to get back to you just before christmas the road was that soft it was like a sponge cake if you drove on its flower to try and push you off the road and i asked came in actually and asked the girl if she could get one of the bosses to the top and make it a bit safe nothing ever happened and i don 't think unless you put that cauldron under the road to take all that water you 're just going to have the same problem that you 've got now thanks for watching um we 'll take these comments on board and i 'll have the tech services director contact mr woodward any others all right um first item is confirmation minutes recommendation is that the minutes of the ordinary meeting called on the 30th of december 2021 be confirmed do you have a question a meeting that uh obviously yeah the swearing of oath and affirmation of councils so very important in the uh appointment of delegates to appropriate committees i 'm thinking mr mayor it appears to be an accurate recording of the meeting and i 'll second the relation thank you i 'll put the motion all in favor now item zero nine zero one which is the mayoral minute and record i need a second castle do you wish to speak to it no sorry i 'll let you do this um obviously if i could i 'd just ask you um um obviously the community banking issue issue is of interest to everyone in the community which is a third of the way down page seven i was wondering if you could update us with the meeting with ben stewart regarding that community banking opportunity i think you 're on the board i declined the idea of a board it 's not that far advanced yet there 's a group of people who recognise that uh both our major banks are cutting back on their services and i think that is we think that that is probably a precursor to going to a non-retail bank in town and we 're exploring opportunities for a community bank of the bendigo bank bill yeah and we 've had one meeting with um a representative of bendigo bank talking about the sorts of capital that needs to be invested and the sorts of building they would need and the the size of the mortgage they would need to have to make it work now we haven 't gone much beyond that yet it is simply halt in oberon at some stage and we 're working to mitigate that so if i could ask is this going to be under the bendigo bank banner or a separate uh at the moment most likely if it gets up it 'll be under it needs to have a a registered financial institution actually running and benigo bank has got a pretty good track record in that area uh and that 's the one we 're talking to at the moment has there been any approach to blaming because i think they have a similar problem uh i think they do and i 've in this and we 're talking there 's a couple of other uh places that are trying to work through the same thing and can now drive things yeah i would hesitate to take it any further at the moment it 's very early stages but um as you know glenn stewart is a has a long history of banking and he 's leading the group and uh hopefully we 'll have some sort of outcome in the next six to eight months i would go but i i got held up and couldn 't go into the overall business breakfast on the 7th february uh in january and there was five of us there which was a little bit lonely but the second one there was about 15 people from a variety of business organizations around town and it was quite a productive meeting in terms of achieving networking through the business community i think the next one will be even better thank you and i think council 's invite from glenn to attend uh those meetings thank you and on page nine the last item which is the meeting with pitt prize 3 the board 's vision of the future of the overrun rsl um interesting i won 't disclose some of the things we mentioned because they will they 're they 're confidential but he has a a vision which will take the rsl um to a more modern look they have a lot of spaces in there which are just unusable at the moment and will remain safe for some time but uh he 's he and he is attempting to and i think that if that happens it 'll be a boon to oberon not just the rsl but well there 's a crucial facility for this challenge it is absolutely uh and that was one of the things we discussed the issue of um as an evacuation center along with a couple of other ones we have around the place um how important that is and the objective sorry potential for looking at grants to improve facilities for that particular aspect of that site oh sorry i 'm sorry mr councilman um on page eight uh third of january um foreign [Music] um legal access for macquarie subdivisions yes um i honestly think the way this to me has changed the access over the blocks has changed um i would caution against going any further this is this is under um the legal process that 's taking place and i understand where you 're going yep um and we did discuss a few weeks ago but it is it is currently before the learn environment supreme court yeah that 's fine but what i 'm asking you is can what 's going on and then the implication it might be over in council i think all councillors need to know that but i think we need to brief him and uh yeah you know it 's complicated being two councils and [Music] yes i support council mccarthy 's um requesting to have a session with with our legal people especially given past history on some developments in some development applications in on current ones um we probably need to have a better understanding of um what we should prove and what we shouldn 't approve legally and um with the final approaching quickly that we are going to change or review our planning documents i think it would be well worthwhile to do it before then even if we or something but it could be in a confidential section of the meeting but i support council mccarthy i think it 's a very good initiative um through the chair as part of the council 's ongoing induction processes that will be one of the things that we that we will be undertaking um i was in fact on the trying to organize a session for councils to in fact come along and get that get that training as required um yes we will can we have a can the council have a copy of this induction program what we can expect to uh to go through in this in this induction programme something because i wasn 't aware of this it 's only happened today it was it was a it was the next process from the original thank you with respect i do the general manager has foreshadowed it certainly to me before that he was going to do an induction session um i don 't think he put a date on it but he didn 't actually say to me he was going to do it so oh shoot i was going i had assumed it was going to happen all issues about planning that 's cancelled it 's not something that we 'll try and bombard you within [Music] any other questions put the motion all right notice the motion mr mayor can i move that uh 1303 and 1001 be considered together because they deal 1303 is a report on this particular issue and it has some supporting documentation so i play that we uh set 1001 aside and deal with it as part of pins 903. sorry you happy councillor mccarthy hell as long as we get a result okay all right item uh 1002 council mccarthy the motion is to cancel transfer funds from the waste fund mainly scrap metal income to fund the stone wall at the common that will become a living treasures display wall for the 40 designs i 'll just drop here now there we go done second place well check it out cancel my technique yeah um thank you mr mayor um this project is trying to get the living treasures out this has been going on for years um so this is one way of funding it i put this up several years ago and when there 's saffronic at the time said we couldn 't do it had to source out outside information to find out that we can do it this way i think at the time when i put it up before there was men so this is a way of making sure that this thing goes forward and gets finished so the idea is that we finish the rose wall once we get confirmation that it 's legally right to go 1.8 meters high with no barrier and then this one would follow before we do the other wall on gen island road i think the solomon road one 's already constantly nolan road is contracted the rose walls are next so this will be third in line for the stone you know i 'm just wondering why this couldn 't be the next one in line soon it 's not a big big wall the other one 's fairly small well that 's an issue for the general manager to sort out the screen okay all right that 's that does not relate to what you 're asking here well it was originally but um anyway this is where i 'm coming from i think these projects these um living treasures need to be out there shown in the community we 're seeing that they 're no longer allowed to stay in 's get on with it and get it done uh thank you mr b i i think uh it 's a good idea i 'd like to see it finish myself a lot of other people asked and would like to see it finished i the only question i have is is it the correct way to go about it um the funding um not sure if we can i don 't i don 't know what the cost is and i 'm not sure if we can um [Music] transfer from the waste fund to the common fund um that 's the only question i have i i fully agree that we need to to get it completed i don 't know the formality around the funding and where we can take it for legislative clarification services director yeah counselors through the chair that particular revenue that 's generated from that scrap metal salvaging um where we 've been treating that uh it does sit in the waistline but it can be used uh it can be moved for operational purposes that sits outside the general restrictions on the i 'm fine with [Music] i just want a little bit more clarity in relation to the funding what currently is the funding from scrap metal sales per year do we know what that is is it 40 000 or is it more i can 't_''_3325.599 i haven 't said it itemized anywhere through the chair and sporadic counsellor over the last few years um the scrap metal prices for steel have been pretty low i think they 're quite good at them but that 's why that 's why we retain a lot of scrap metal on site to be able to cater for that boost in the form um i 'll i 'll defer to the corporate services director about the way funding should occur and the second thing sorry i can 't recall is how the the what it was going to cost to construct this stone wall at the common i think didn 't didn 't we have an indicative price from the stone mason company that 's doing the um yes and i think i think somewhere in one of the reports it says that work or something so there 's a delay obviously in all projects that he 's got but i 'm just wondering can you remind me what the total cost of that stage was to construct this wall and how much we would likely how much and i 'm not i 'm not sure whether councilman i 'm assuming that we 're not going to going to construct this wall in stages once it 's started it should be completed uh because that 'll make it more expensive to do it in spain but i can 't recall what the cost was to do or the price was to erect it and do the foundation work and the subsidiary work secondly um how many years will it take for the scrap fund to pay for that just some more financial information so through the chair it 's difficult to say how long it takes scrap them to pay for it because of the stagnant and the varied way in which we in fact get an income from that yes so that 's difficult to provide my understanding and i will be 90 000 for a number of walls to be constructed in order to house the um the living treasures in the combination that the common working party has agreed to it 's around those numbers don 't don 't hold me to that please the third question around timing you 're exactly right we 've been advised that because of other projects that are in front of us this project has been delayed by the preferred contractor because of other projects he has um well there are other um so sorry if i could so are we assuming that the scrap metal we 've currently got in a position to sell and i understand from well i would assume that as the price of steel has gone up rapidly in the last six months that we should get a reasonably premium price for scrap metal at the moment um but we have any idea of what we 've the amount we 've got for sale um bearing in mind that obviously this estimation has been on the books has anyone actually done an investigation on that [Music] and we actually for it where do we get the delta maybe could you advise us on on that or are we able to borrow from a friend and then pay back if we sell scrap metal next year general manager this is i think yep so through funding is an issue through the chair there is that option given the delay in the contractor the other option is to defer like to utilize future operational plans to do that and that should cover the delta to be able to achieve the project it 's purely a matter of trying to get a timeline on when the contractor is able to undertake these works noting that we 've engaged the contractor to do projects on their behalf at least in that space and that 's that 's fine because as part of the as part of the common fund you want some consistency in how you 've developed it and that 's that 's quite all right but council just need to be aware that because of that there could be delays in in how that and how that 's delivered which could delta so mr i 'm basically in support of that because i do i agree with uh council mccarthy and kelp sort of keeping things we 've had these for a while and we haven 't been able to display them i think it 's a pity we haven 't displayed um so that the sooner we can the better but obviously as long as we 've got if we can cover it i 'm i 'm in support so you 're perfectly happy that we can actually fund the process but it 's not not this financially it 's relatively through prefer um my questions are similar to those asked by councilman and councilmember i don 't have any problem with the project itself um and it 's part of the plan for the comment it 's just whether that is the best place for the funds to come from um so questions are would as an alternative it would it be feasible to allocate well either use some of the existing funds in the town improvement fund that are there for the common improvements or if that isn a fair amount of unallocated funds in the town improvement fund and maybe we could use some of those increase the allocation for the common improvement and be able to go ahead with that using those funds so that 's the first question and the second question is if if the funds come from the waste fund um what impact does will that have on works at the tip i would have thought that our need for every dollar we can get for the the tip improvements uh would be really valuable so i assume that 's where the scrap metal income currently goes into the waste fund for either operations or for improvements at the tip and if it 's diverted elsewhere what impact on the tip so that 's the second question i 'll answer the second question first and you 're exactly right um traditionally anything that would generate from income generated from the tip we use and it gets internally restricted to the waste fund um as you 've been as indicated that 's the opportunity to do that because there is there is some process you want if you move it there you can 't use it in the facility which is traditionally put there the first question in relation to ti is that um council will be aware that there 's been quite a bit of work done in the ti fund to in fact allocate the progress and make sure that with that nexus between unallocated in that fund is as low as it possibly can so there isn 't a lot of unallocated within the t iphone the reason why this has come up is because the projects that have been endorsed by previous councils and the level of income we 're currently within the ti fund for the common improvement has been allocated already so we 've we 've expended the money within within the common fund to do the priority projects that councils [Music] that part of the question was based on my understanding of the figures in the director of corporate services report uh on the sea i was done i i got the impression from from those figures that there was a fair amount of unallocated so i 's not the case what is the situation with the allocation for the common improvements with all of that money already earmarked for particular projects at the common or could that be utilized for this project just through the chair the report is projects that have been allocated that have incurred expenditure within the time frame that 's not inclusive of all products or project applications it 's a snapshot billiard expenditure in those expenditure internal ti during the last three months it 's not a full representation of the total ci and lfs projects um it still shows the common balance january 2020 to 267 is all all of that year marks for particular projects so if i could ask for just a brief explanation through uh services and hence finance what is the unallocated amount in the ti fund currently or what do you project it will be if we expensed all the projects that we currently have on the books for the ti fund at the 30th of june 2022. yeah for this year based on the all the allocations at the moment there 's around 4 i think we 're dancing around this subject the key issues are that we can 't do it in this financial media system because there are no resources available there is a clear indication that people want to get on with it and i support that so i think the mover or the second should perhaps put in something regarding the operational plan so the general manager then has it on his books to get it done in the next one or two years around the issue and i 'm trying to find out what the key issues are to get this happening yep well you can move an amendment from there you can move and remember the money okay you can have a right or brought it by okay thank you mr mayor um like i said this has been going on back and forth for ages um if anyone 's been following the um common working party um it was about the same price as the um rose garden wall roughly about seventy four thousand dollars it was a price we 've tried to modify it a few bit simpler but the council of the day said they wanted a long wall like the throsby wall out of black springs so this has been going back and forth back and forth all i put in this that we 've got a significant amount of money coming from the cash scrap metal go at the tip there 's no scrap metal left that 's how much has been resourced normally that 's left so the significant amount of money is it 's just important that someone didn 't put two and two together and let us know what income actually come in because i think last week they actually ceased operation so we should have some sort of tally back of how much they 've taken and what it was worth but anyway let 's keep moving forward you either want to do this or we don 't and it 's going to go over into the new financial year if there 's a 60 000 income from the scrap metal i 'm sure from the ti fund that goes to the common we could fund the other 20 the money out of the water um [Music] well yeah if i could just have a could i ever write a reply don 't move it has the writer advice okay can i make a comment uh yes you can thank you mr man um i i fully agree with carolyn mccarthy this is dragged on for a number of months longer than insured but as i said in a second information i did have some concerns about the funding maybe there 's an opportunity that we could defer this until the march meeting and have the director of finance and corporate services come back with some more information around what funding is available from the scrap metal waste fund and if there is some other um bucket that we could prove one of a better word that we may be able to get the balance out of if not we 've probably got to defer it to aftertune just just a comment councilman thank you uh i 'll propose an amendment the council include in the operational plan for 2022 the funding of the stonewall of the commons that the 40 designs and that and that appropriate funding be sourced in the operational plan by the general manager for that for that i if i can make a comment now um i 'd just like you to check that that 's what you desire for them um i 'm quite sure of that process can i add extra to it for a second well a few seconds there 's a small amendment i 'm happy to do small limits after your second council council equipment [Music] looking at the current financial year 's ti fund particularly the common improvements whether it is possible whether all of that money is expected to be spent by 30th of june for the common improvements i 'm not sure if that was my comment on this is that we are in um february now we 've already got a delay from our stone masons being indicated [Music] um i think we all want to expedite this but i just don 't see with the with two other projects ahead of it etcetera that it 's going to commence probably before first of july happy with that well i i um i 'm not at this stage because i think if we 've already if we if the ti fund has funds allocated for projects and those projects that funding has to be used for those projects unless we decide not to proceed with those any one of those projects we can 't really reallocate the money as my concern um in november there was a resolution that we 've moved thousand dollars from the cook park to the to um ti phone into the iphone however i don 't think that 's inconsistent with what you 'll put up there and this will i think satisfy everyone in terms of getting into the operational plan and making it happen and my understanding is mr mayor in correct the 70 000 was moved from that project in the ti fund to fund another project it wasn 't to be left in their own allocated no no it was too it was to undertake the projects as prioritised that 's right so therefore we we really can 't use that money because it 's already we can 't take money from allocated projects the stage therefore i think we have to look at next year 's episode you 're you 're happy with i 'm happy with that as it stands uh anyone else have a comment on this amendment absolutely correct thank you any further i don 't do anything i don 't mind if it 's cut as two sentences if that 's too long um when you put the nose emotion up to do a project you 've got to identify where the money comes from um that 's pure and simply what i 've done and uh yeah things looks like it 's not going to move forward yeah i 'll accept that on the chin but um yeah this this has just gone on for far too long to um not activate these people that made over and great so whatever happens even if it goes into the 22-23 year i 'm happy with that thank you sorry right reply i i think this actually does ensure that the project goes ahead to nelson mccarthy although and and i was worried that as you know and and you have been a great proponent that we have to do a lot to the tip we need to probably use as much of the money there as we can and this will ensure that it has priority in the next operational plan so i think this doubt does guarantee it goes ahead it has funding the general manager is obliged for the amendment does it fail those against those against all right 1003 the road audit steering committee the notion is that the road audit steering committee be re-established and that councils be appointed to the committee will the meeting of the committee be arranged in the near future and that a report setting out the progress of each recommendation and the morrison lay report will be provided to the committee remover seconder councilman gibbon council tucker thank you mr mayor um the councillors are probably aware that uh rhodes is is my biggest interest and and uh what i can 't handle uh before prior to the election i have read the morrison and low report i 'm not quite sure council responses that [Music] i came up with previously but i 'd rather not go into those specific concerns to you because i would rather hear the explanations and the discussion from morrison lowe and federal councils so i think reforming this committee would be the appropriate place to have those more detailed discussions um my understanding from what i 've heard from the council is is that there were it was intended that council would provide updates on the progress of implementing the each three months but the most recent that i 've been able to define from the council is it was may 2021 so it 's nine months since from the most recent one that has been provided to me anyway um and in any case those recommendations could potentially change following discussions with any new councillors on that committee and i just made the point that roads are by far council 's biggest expenditure and we as the council need to satisfy ourselves that we are getting value for money and that they 're not creating a major expense for our excesses if our newly constructed to thank you councilman um thank you i am you realize originally not my notice of motion to form the uh to have the the road um road review um by morrison lowe i think it 's important because it is such a large part of oberon 's expenditure it was 70 percent it might even be more than that now with all the new capital i 'm sorry it 's only five percent sorry 75 it 's such a huge um part of our expenditure um that i think that um it 's an area that needs continuous monitoring um to ensure that um we as councils are happy with the standard has been said by council of tucker and that um it gives the gives the incoming councils an opportunity to look at the morrison low report and to and to understand the content the concept and why it was instituted and what else has happened since that report so it 's also an opportunity for the director of technical services and others to update councils on our largest expenditure items i know the works committee does it and it could be uh it could very well be i don 't i haven 't just got by certainly haven 't_''_4832.239 discussed this pose but it could be as an adjunct to our works committee meeting this special area of looking just at the roads think about it [Laughter] we when councillor mckibben originally raised the concept of parade 's audit 2019 there was quite a lot of work uh the discussion went into the terms of reference around the audit before it was set out for requests for quotes and love of ira morrison lowe where the successful people appointed to do the audit one of their recommendations was to have a steering committee in review the the findings and the progress on the recommendations quarterly we did have one meeting in may 2020 and as councilman tucker said probably the last update was in may 2021 which was just a uh virtually a spreadsheet update similar to um the one we get on the outstanding actions at the end of the business but but given the amount of work to get into getting the audit and the recommendations i think it 's important that we reintroduce the steering committee or um a similar committee to meet quarterly and review the progress and also review whether those recommendations and actions are still current because some of those issues will have been resolved and some of those roads will have been um upgraded significantly i think if we read back through the report so i 'll fully support the the other two councils on reintroducing or forming another committee to do this i think it 's really really important and i think we should make sure that these [Music] minutes from these meetings are readily available made public because the right players and the residents and the businesses are continually asked about i think this is if we do this we can give them back the information or we can give them the feedback that 'll help allay some of their fears and what 's going on i think it 's a must that we formed just trevor i just have a question that said that is to be emotionless to be re-established so why was it originally well should just sit alongside the works for me because they clearly cover all of this already um my question is drivers why was it disbanded through the chair the reason through the chair the steering committee was established not through a resolution of council it was a working party that was put together to discuss and implement terms of reference that were that were the that were determined by a native submission once put up with as a result of that a whole program was put in place [Music] the document itself as a result is a working operational document so it isn 't publicly available which makes me wonder how people have a opportunity to see the recommendations that sit within it but there are things there that council laws and the steering committee at the time also didn 't agree with as part of those recommendations which were taken back and dealt with as a final report for council which we used as the starting point of implementing programs and works in our works areas we continue to do that i continue to update councillors well i did met quarterly to discuss that um those things will continue for a new council but general manager you might explain when that occurred i 'm so sorry as part of as part of um the processes that i have in place this program sits as one of the general managers kpis and every quarter we meet as a group to discuss those things and and know that program was one of those things that we discussed as part of that quarterly update which counselors can attend or not based on what their own circumstances are like um they are the things that have led to the development of a number of things within our organisation and that 's where the steering committee was set up to present and get resolved the morris and my report that we talked about so it was never a formalized council committee as a committee of the whole or or delegations or delegates to that this notice of motion seeks to establish something like that and they 'll be up to council to determine whether i want to do that or not or whether i council being involved in a you know works community type scenario any other comments johnson carting and mr mayor um due to the 70 expenditure for our budget and setting this order steering committee up i can 't see why we don 't bring the works committee into a quarterly meeting and have this roads committee steering committee a part of it it 's just too much money and there 's too much bigger gap from when something 's going on to when you get reported so i think with our roads especially the way they are at the moment we we need the worst community to come and bring the steering committee if you don 't have a steering committee is it all of council what 's that what 's the premise that 's probably what i 'd be asking um i think it 's a matter uh obviously for the council i i i don 't object i don 't have a problem uh my second promotion having it as a subset of the the works committee i don 't have a problem at being a whole council to be involved in reviewing the morrison low and how it 's implemented then it seemed logical but it could be an adjunction that works for me it 's just a section in the works community on to hear what other councils say actually yes i actually think it would make sense having it adjunct with the works committee yeah i 'm not disagreeable with having it as a section in the works committee meaning that i would think that we should then have the works committee metaphor monthly instead of six months um i will speak against the original motion but i will also when i 've done that i will see what amendments might come out i speak against this motion because um start with it doesn 't have in terms of reference and if you have a committee that 's got that much potential input to council 's budget no matter how in terms of expect every committee needs to have in terms of reference i think the works committee does that reasonably well already the system whereby when we did the update on the on the it was a particular item in there and he gave an update but it 's still a much less and that is by the way a committee of the whole that does that and although not all councils have attended that traditionally so i couldn 't see when i went through all of this how that particular committee was going to add value i do see how perhaps doing a one more works committee meeting that is a four monthly cycle will provide the sort of oversight we 're after so i will force shadow on motion that says that the works committee meet on a full monthly basis and formally consider the progress of the morrison my report at each meeting i think they meant quarterly to meet which would be three no in fact four monthly why wouldn 't you just do it four times a week because of that council meetings when there 's already 12. and that the community sorry review the recommendations formally review the progress on the recommendations of the morrison and low reports what does that mean is that your motion um [Music] favor sorry uh shouldn 't there be some discussion well someone 's sorry put them in there already um i totally agree i didn 't um think that we needed another committee formed uh of i feel that the works for me does do everything that 's required um they 're low uh most low report i did look for that online combined a lot and little bit about it but i did notice that there was 19 recommendations so if we could be um thank you mr mayor um i i don 't have a problem if if uh the if the review of the morrison low report that i would like to see happen on an ongoing basis if that happens as part of the works committee rather than a new committee that 's okay by me as long as that written was happening my only comment on on the amendment is about the four monthly basis my understanding is that there are supposed to be updates on progress each three months and maybe that would make more sense to align those meetings with those updates and the the only item on the agenda for some of the those meetings uh without any other work works committee uh matters um but that that 's my only equivalent uh with it and i was also very just going to comment that i did go back through uh the list of previous meetings and i 've seen that in most years there 's only been one works committee the occasionally the second one but uh in most years and from the list that i so it 's going to add either two or if we make it three months three months later it 'll be an extra three reasons per i agree that in the first part of my term last term council there was only one that i insisted if they 're going to happen we 're going to have two and i think you 'll find in 1819 uh that was the case had to go back through old um old agendas in business it wasn 't the general business of one of the agendas some time ago and that 's where i found it um but i documents that should be on the uh on the at least the councilman portal that we 've discussed as a as with a number of other documents so that 's a minor kind of thing through the chair this process has always been done through confidential so i 'll go back and look myself to see that it 's been recognized publicly if that 's the case [Music] having an internal operational document that you use as your guiding principles about changing your attitudes and behavior in your workforce so it 's um something that i 'm very interested in finding out where where that came from um the second thing is is that the quarterly update is a distinct kpi that councils have placed against me as the general manager to provide those updates and put and put those morrison low recommendations and updates into that forum they occur every quarter and every quarter i provide that information to councils either one way or another council want to provide a works committee three times a year um my i don 't have a problem in general with that all then um decrease the amount of works reports you get every month not every three months or every six months every month that you get from the engineer in terms of a ordinary council works committee is an adjunct and a whole of council committee that allows them to make decisions that they don 't make in a normal council meeting through a works committee arrangement if you 're going to have three a year that will just simply probably lessen the amount of reports every third or every within the following week when you have a council meeting which will match the generally managed kpis in this road or morrison load any more comments on this amendment all right i 'm putting the amendment all in favor against all right okay okay so the amendment 's defeated so your shadow mccarthy all we 've got to do is modify that through four three to four two three four and the second therefore cancel the carboxymeter council any comments okay so i 'll put the amendment all those in favor against so the amendment now becomes the motion and the monthly basis sorry for monthly basis sorry three months a year three monthly basis and that the committee formally reviewed the recommendations and the progress of the morrison larry report all those in favor okay good outcome now page 13 counselors item 1101 central new south wales joint organization board meeting the recommendation is the report item on the left arrow was received and noted counseling second place second extensive uh report and uh dealt with quite a few subjects which was which was good to see um and obviously uh talked about its achievements in the presentation of 25th 1921 so a lot obviously a lot to do with energy and water in particular and what 's happening in those areas um and it 's quite interesting to see how involved we are with energy programming and the energy policy through the go obviously we know about the regional procurement and contracts but the other area i would ask is page 19. halfway down does say that the jo has endorsed the concept design for the proposed medlo bath upgrade i 'm just wondering which option 's been endorsed option or the short option the short the longer tunnel or the shorter top oh general management wasn 't that that broad meaning oh [Music] [Music] okay i 'm i 'm happy with that and i 'm very pleased to move this recommend this report uh you recommend it as received just a couple of questions just my own clarification of what this joint organisation is and how it 's funded i assume that 's the new name for what used to be called central um but how does the funding work does each account each member council contribute and how are those contributions calculated or is it separately funded by the state government or a bit of foe and is it is it a requirement for each council to be a member of a joint organisation i 'll refer to the general managers he 's got more experience than i have in the joint organisation the number of questions there council the first one is yes um it 's a subsidiary or it 's a military subsidiary it 's a it 's a government mandated organization that um dictated their groups centroc as a old unit that used to do the same thing it was simply just a morphing into that minus lithgow and midwest from the old central it is not mandatory to be part of a jo however it 's highly encouraged and a lot of the deliverables with grants rely on your council being part of the jo where that regional prosperity and regional benefit can be seen um they hadn 't they were given startup funding by the state back in the day when these things kicked off but um the generation is from uh each council 's payment of these to be part of that and those fees are based generally on a population base so the big council is playing more than the little councils but equally the big councils get the benefit of utilizing the land and the space of little councils whilst the little councils get the benefit of the population of the bigger councils to assist in uh formalizing grant projects and the like on a regional so there are four pillars of the jo and i won 't go the report gives an indication of what there is but that is pretty much how it works so now you don 't have to be part of it um council 's been quite successful in procuring a lot of stuff at a benefit two councils being part of that and we continue to be an active winner thank you and just to clarify i was certainly not for a moment thinking or suggesting that council will not be a member i just want to have some clarification of how it works thank you sorry i know i apologize if you thought that that 's what you were that wasn 't and i have to say that this particular joint organization appears to work a lot better than most in the state in fact it 's probably the most successful ones because it 's it 's basically gone from center off to jo all right any other questions or comments with motions put that report on be received all right item 1201 over on youth council the recommendation is that the council receive report item twelve zero one as the information and councilman thanks um i 'm just encouraging that side to put their hands up oh sorry um i think it was mayor this is a detailed report but it also shows that the youth councils get to go to both boriga and black springs um at the end of 2021 calendar year and um i have been to barriga um community association and for the black space community association um since the youth health the council attended and both were um very enthusiastic about the attendance by the youth council of both those locations um and i think in particular christine healey gave a very good presentation the youth health council at black springs on the heritage of black springs and there are a number of presentations and and similarly at barriga the community association provided a lot of input to the youth council i think it was as i said appreciated as much by the community associations their attendance is by the youth council attendees and also i know that a former councillor of councillor don cable provided a lot of input into this organization the youth council that in the future though you know i can 't recall who our delegate is at the moment to the youth council i think it 's katie um you have someone who you know very hard to follow in his footsteps in relation to that organization he really pushed it and helped them he was highly regarded by the organizer by the youth council so i think the accolades that are expressed for don by the youth council i just deserve so i have i would like i am very pleased to be able to move that this report be accepted by council thank you councilman i i think we 've got a wonderful of young citizens there and they do a fine job councilman speaks for itself and i can only endorse the council of giving some comments about don cable so let 's say because item 1202 from the community services committee meeting and the recommendation is the council received report item 1202 as information second please community being the chair of this committee now obviously i can 't um talk too much about what 's happened but hope we continued supporting the blue tree project and um just saw some of the other things that were really interesting and it 's an important committee so i certainly would hope we would accept that accept the report [Music] thank you councillors put the motion on favor item 1203 the black springs community hall committee meeting recommendations the council received port report 1203 as information and second council mckibben secretary councillor thank you mr chairman um look at uh i would this uh committee is uh starting to work really quite well and we 're getting some runs on the board there 's been a lot of unit unanimously about what 's required and we have prioritized obviously the electricity safety of the hall um we both counselor paid and i attended a meeting last night which reaffirmed the priorities of the organization and i 'm very happy to remove this and i think we 're getting some good results out of black students yes it 's a good report and it 's a good team and everyone 's moving ahead all right put the recommendation to council i couple of questions and again purely for my own clarity and information uh could the gm behave explained is the black springs hall a council asset and i don 't think it is from what i can recall and if that 's the case what responsibilities does council have for maintenance and what what funding if any discounts will provide through the chair council was the trust manager of the hall and was placed into that some time ago now that 's the reason why 355 committee has been established to support that hall um do we fund it yes do we see grants for its upgrades yes that forms part of taking over control of it as far as being the trust manager for the for the infrastructure or the asset thank you any for comments so can i just have a question no clarification next please mr ned so counselors trust managers so that means they can down actually um through the chair no we don 't own it it 's owned by the crown we are the trust manager um running its day-to-day operations and upgrades and the chair he used to operate under the village or the progress association used to be the trust manager um when the crown lands act or amendments to the crown lands act were considered the the um progress association decided that they didn 't want to continue to have that role and they asked council to take over that this is why we now have a 355 for the black sprinkler any good questions just in relationship to the number one item on the list um you need the two people to attend to the meeting they 're saying the three-phase upgrade is there a contribution being paid to essential energy or does that 13.5 13 000 dollars that we give them a couple of meetings ago does that include that that 's my concern [Music] i know that the uh the billy found that we did utilize was for quite just filled with the upgrade i 'm not aware of the essential energy element so take that on notice um i think um the total electrical upgrade bill i think was 15 or 16 000 from memory and it that funds um it was the priority issue so i think it i can 't recall i think it was part partly funded by mostly funded by council departments maybe partly by community but that was the order of magnitude 15 to 16 000 the electricity upgraded three it included the three phases [Music] [Music] just the question there from council mccarthy was just the essential energy element of that because uh i know that the philly foreign element that we the subsidy paid to essential is that correct originally when kerry uh councillor terry gibbons asked to look at there was no three base in front of the ball so it may be upgraded i don 't know but it might be the contract is going to put the three-phase on but then still not available out the street that 's my concern and just a verbal report back to me i 'm happy with that but all i 'm getting at is that [Music] because over on the substation when before they 've done the car park it was suggested they run the conduit right across the street the driveway see as far as i knew there was no three phases of trying to do it might be then here i 'm not sure thank you you 're clear thank you but uh put the recommendation that council receive report 1203 's information all right heritage committee item 1204 the recommendation is that one the minutes of the harry 's community held on the 29th of november 2021 he received his information the council considered making the culvert barrier on carl wood road out of timber and three council investigate the retention and relocation of the phone booth at the iconic hotel to a suitable location within the village area eg near the bus stop do i have a mover arsenal mccarthy second man castle trend bus um number two is uh just the culverts on the carwood road the car would road when uh um to what was there before the big shiny armco fence that the post and rail could be put in and if the armco is required by the safety that it be screwed on the back of the post and rail that was retain the phone box somewhere in that location down the corner if we could even though the rural fire service shed the other one uh maybe because of the electricity i don 't think if we put it over near the bus stop there 's any power there but we we really need to retain it apparently they 've had a survey and it 's on private property so let 's hope we can retain it there it 's handy for the kids it 's now free yeah so if some child comes off the bus and he 's got a problem and then i will finally go to that bus uh the phone and be able to contact his parents or anyone thank you any other comments um thank you um i just um the relocation of a phone booth i suppose is council has to contact telstra because it 's really not our asset and um that means probably laying a telephone wire which trying to get telstra to do especially if there 's a phone visit free may be a bit difficult but um are we in the resolution is investigate okay their attention i 've got we 'll have to bring something back after conversations with the authority can i ask this question as those or there is that is there an indication that they 're going to remove the the phone box is that the bridge that the rationality is disgusting brought up or do they want to move away from the pub or is our contractor that we use is engaged by them as well uh in planning and they 've investigated it and we said that it 's on private property i 'm not supposed to have the look of the pub whether you 're taking the photograph or whatever here 's this 1999 fan box and is this old hotel whether you 're doing a photo shoot or whatever we 're not trying to find what 's going to get a heritage one yeah yeah council turned up oh sorry broadcaster mccarthy so my concern is if we start investigating this and if it 's not thrown don 't fix it it might be the if you raise it as an issue 'm more than happy to do what if they go there and say i 'm sorry it 's on private ground they cut the cable cut the electricity and then there 's no facility down there or all we 're doing is writing a letter so my question is that there is a phone box there it 's on private property how did it get to be on private property and was it approved by the owners and some arrangement made to keep it there as uh something for the community through the chairs or something just a quick one third page down page 43 um i was a little uh interested to know that tina 's slattery was in attendance and then she was an apology but that 's not uh they 're not our minute so um really we it 's madison association not for the heritage community [Music] so she should be lost out of the attendance then right oh it 's duplicated sorry she definitely that 's the main bus stop area for the children to get on and off i don 't know why they there forever i think we find it isn 't really right on the line right unless that 's moved all right i promised that i would give people a break after about two hours it 's pretty much exactly two hours so we 'll just take a three minute stretch all right resuming the uh recording of this meeting at 7 40 p.m all right item 1205 the local emergency management committee meeting and the recommendation is that council will receive report 1205 as information second closer and second place council um thank you mr mayor i think this uh report speaks for itself and i 'm very happy to recommend it accept it that 's the any other comments on this report i put the recommendation all in favor one item 1206 the traffic advisory local committee meeting and the recommendation is that council receive report 1206 as information mover and second please councilman kevin council tucker um thank you mr mayor um a detailed report um with quite a bit of information about speed zone reviews and a number of other issues um i do hope they don or i 'll be even late anyway i 'm very happy to uh move this uh report be recognized to be accepted thank you council tucker all right thank you mr mayor and just noted that that 's the the media from uh back in november um so we 've had another meeting last week and so particularly the the item for the angle parking that 'll be part of last week 's meeting that we 'll look at in march so nothing more to add on all right thank you all in favor now we 're up to reports to decision and this is uh the centrock well it 's not central it 's actually the central new south wales joint organization cnswjo supply and delivery of bulk fuel contracts just in terms of this one it is a carryover from an old group which is why it 's called central it 's the name and the contract but that 's the reason why now this is just this this business paper provides a bit of information for the new councillors on on the central new south wales joint council agreed to participate in the regional procurement process for the supply and delivery of bulk fuel and advise centroc of its decision do i have a mover councilman cuban and the secondary council in the kidney um thank you mr mayor obviously our our bulk gum contract well our contracts with through centroc slash the jo provide us with advantage of being able to bulk purchase a number of uh of things such as fuel um um what else is there we 've had energy contracts within electricity et cetera and they provide considerable benefit um my only question i suppose in this one is obviously we don 't lock in a price because currently prices are quite high we have a discount to the to a a certain price i assume that we have ran out of this it 's not a locked in future price of one dollar you know 1.90 for diesel etc so it 's it 's it 's just a discount to the to a retail price or a wholesale price that we get as a as an organization as part of the joint and fall no doubt but in the quantities of bulk purchase it has the values of council being a smaller council certainly if there 's a larger cheque coming through on a milk run that we would give the same benefit in fueling our underground storage facilities so there is a quantity of scale so but we 're not locking in a price now for all future quantities but when we when this is goes out to tenderness you 're locking in a discount to a to the price of diesel is how i understand it or to the wholesale price of diesel so that if the price goes from 1.90 to forty and and we get ten cents or twenty cents off the of the per litre price it 's the twenty cents that that we lock in off the top of the wholesale price is that right yeah that 's great okay that 's that 's all that 's what i was trying to i thought that was the case um i 'm very happy to uh on the basis of uh past uh past performance and past simple advantage to council i 'm very happy to move the recommendation um in relation to the two parts one and two yes mr mayor um i know right i assume that there 's the same amount of councils that are in this um agreement and i assume that they 're probably still in the same amount of negotiations and management so i struggle to see how they can increase their management fees from 1.15 0.7 percent because they have to increase from what i would probably consider doing the same amount of work i don 't know but that 's that 's what it says it seems like a hefty increase if a hefty increase i think the second paragraph of that council contribution uh explains to some extent why that 's the case new south wales joint organization other participating joint organizations are reviewing ways to generate income for the joint organisation conducting aggregated procurement and the state of that industry so i think what they 're saying is they don 't have much money to do stuff with and they 're trying to be able to get and join organizations five i think six yeah just a comment yeah no are you recommending yes yes okay i 'll put the put the motion back sorry um just one brief comment or question it 's always amused me when you get recommendations like number two by central decision i think it 's totally superfluous it 's simplicity number one we stopped doing that um yes i said not so we 're not gonna do it guys well no perhaps some things we need to actually put that in there but i agree in this case this is purpose but we 'll still vote on that recommendation at this stage that there is a formality of completing a form to submit back to central as a participant so that 's all that is is formality of recommendation and that form being sent back to participate all right and item 1302 supply of road based material tender t2022 the recommendation is that council nominate the opening open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 166 alpha of the local government regulation 2005 for the supply of road-based materials for at the conclusion of the tender period a report will be provided at the next available ordinary council meeting for selection of a suitably qualified supplier or suppliers do i have a mover council mccarthy and counselor okay got some coffee i 'm happy for this to go out to tender the only thing that concerns me is that you can get a price and the material doesn 't bind and your road falls apart so somewhere out there in this selection of tender there must be a statement that has some sort of body to bind and operate from what we require to buy you 've only got to take the three kilometers the rms done and the first thing peter stood says we 've sold poor quality material but somewhere along the line someone must have realized it wasn 't good for what they wanted and it lasted for maybe 15 months but we need to also know that this material is what we need for our road use not only the price a year through the chair certainly the attendant would call for a specification in terms pre-qualified specif meaning pre-qualified specifications or a nada accredited or whether it 's a rural product so we would be asking for varying types of grades material so holistically subject to the job that 's being applied to that is the opportunity to select uh the requirements so if it 's transport for new south wales job certainly it would need to be their benchmarks well shouldn 't we set that as our benchmark as well uh yeah again certainly what i 'm saying is that we get courses for courses okay that 's a super job and requirement so yes thank you um it 's really quality control i imagine the specifications and for the different range of material that we 'll be purchasing but is there any quality control on it when it 's delivered if we think it doesn 't meet the specification that we put in the tender or we find that it doesn 't meet those specifications is there any quality control or any uh responsibility on the supply to replace year for the chair certainly they must always produce a graded material uh once a certain area and they should producing or giving us that certified material of course but if there is a concern that we can call for certain or more certificates certification on it and or to certainly add evidence of the failure we can call for replacement products i guess the question is if we 're ordering multiple tons of material are we checking it quality-wise before it 's used before any of it 's used uh yeah through the chair certainly we do regular checks discussions with quarries um again subject to what type of material we do need uh there will be hesitations and alike and or call for certification to make sure that it makes the benchmarks so so those inspections of those quality checks are they formalized to capital regularly after this year certainly for those projects and again transport from new south wales is a and us an idea we do call for certainly that certification yes okay thank you i 'll support the uh i think it 's fair um just uh following on similar thoughts to uh counselor um because this is a have currently two quarries do we envisage of the other quarries in the oberon council area providing responses to our request to tender on this do you believe that the other quarries will be predominantly in overall uh through this year this is an open market agenda so we don 't necessarily need to be within the urban area i mean your multitude for our consideration my question is if this is so if this is crucial too and i believe it is crucial um is it in our own interest to do spot core tests at the ten at the quarries from where we receive tenders and also do we do spot core tests or sample tests or material as it arrives every now and again to just verify you said we inspect and we get may get additional certificates um companies before where we actually do our own sample testing and send it off to nada or do core tests as appropriate on spot occasions to make sure that the material you 're getting is up to up to what the specification says if you don 't do 're going to do spot checks yourself rather than just rely on their data they tend to be more careful in making sure you get the product you want through the top i don 't want to veer into the operational area but i 'm just suggesting that this may be an area that needs to be investigated because i know that the quality of this material is crucial to our roads through the chair um it certainly we would if we suspect in the certificates depending on how current they are can call for additional uh certification they doubt or we 'll take samples ourselves and do that not unlike concrete so we can randomly take four cylinder tests for compressive strength concrete over 28 days or whatever we call so it 's the same time and that 's certainly we suspect there 's an issue people take there i 've seen quarries where they 've got two areas and you know they give you the samples from this one but you end up getting the stuff material from this side or something so i i think we need period in this area but i defer to people who are expert in rows i would make an observation that the quality of the certification is directly related to the quality of the tests you do yes that 's what that i 've been we 've all been uh know what can happen so i just suggest that we maybe should be doing this through the chair once this report simply seeks yes i was part of that scope we could potentially indicate to them that in a contract this additional provision would be made available to us yet that we may do spot checks and spot course samples i think that 's right i 'll probably go one step further and say that if that 's part of it they need to pay for it we just need to be on site to see that they 're taking the right stuff and there 's an independence factor if we do it then we control it too anyways um i don 't really have any comments on on the book the points that you were talking about i did write i thought that they 're really more appropriate for when the next report comes back and uh i 've decided to lose it until that time any more comments all right i 'll put the motion one photo all right page now this is uh item 1393 and that also covers off on council mccarthy 's earlier notice of motion this is for fogger baller road proposed sectional road realignment the recommendation is that council proceed with the creation of a new road alignment which is to a section of the foggebola road eliminating the existing acute bend on this road council allocate funding from section 711 rural roads to the amount of up to thirty five thousand dollars to complete the acquisition works in advance of constructing a new section of unsealed road paper i have a mover also mccarthy secondary council mcgivern councilman the report 's pretty straightforward uh mr mayor um this is only one of the acute corners on the frog road i 've done in my um no summation was that the reason i thought we should proceed with this we have a willing participant and i thought my memory that the last one we tried to do out in the beaconsville road i thought we were over 125 000 to do an acute corner out there and i think that the person 's now rescinded that action so um anyway like just give you for an idea of how much some of these things can cost so um yeah i think the 35 000 out of the section 94 which has got to be spent on rural roads so we 've got our source we 've got the option and it 's up for the councillors to see if we want to go ahead but sorry and i think we can actually do the road works once we 've acquired the land by doing backloads of uh bringing gravel in in other words we can 't dig it out because the fiber optic and the gas line is it seen so and the ground 's pretty substantially stable so i think if we can secure backloads there to bring it through and we should be able to build the rest of the road pretty this um i know i think the fencing costs for maybe five i think uh the director of technical services whether it was 500 meters included the realignment or it was an addition and i think it was a bit of uncertainty sit there so he 's allowed for 20 000 which probably gets up to 800 meters um i 'm hoping we can save a little bit on that because even with the increase in fencing costs it 's usually with fit about 16 to 18 000 a kilometer so we should hopefully be able to do eight to nine thousand and say a thousand for removal the old fence we 're hoping we could do it for ten or eleven thousand can get it done for okay that 's fine thank you with a bit of a bit of uh risk on top council trimbas um i have a question regarding this road um i 've driven this road i 've never met one car on it and i just uh assumed a little bit sort of questioning why we don 't spend money on the road that about very expensive road works that need to be done and this starts at possibly 35 000 but then future rate improvements can be undertaken when funding permits so i just think there 's more important roads to be fixed unless there 's it 's a black spot or you 've seen many accidents or i don 't see the reasoning behind why this one road has been picked up and i 've shooting it myself and i haven 't met a car and i don 't even remember this was just i was just hoping i can just address some of councillor trembert 's issues that that then that 's in question is very sharp elbow and it is actually quite a busy road if you 're on it regularly and then you 've got the question of trucks bringing stock and sometimes there are foster trucks that also cut across this road and that bend is actually quite dangerous the reason why this has been supported by council reporters purely on the basis that council has traditionally where they can try to look at ways to remove 90 um advised that another one on beaconsfield road where it was quite a bit now it was also quite a bit because the window said that 's what they wanted for and not necessarily what the cost to remove it was but that 's that 's the bye-bye the report 's been provided because traditionally council has a an interest in trying to minimize the number of 90 degree or high high turn corners on on rural roads um we understand there is a there is a number this has come about because there 's landowner interest to in fact sell some of their land in order to um to achieve that outcome so that 's the rationale behind the report council tucker thank you mr smith a couple of questions um first of all council mccarthy 's notice of motion talked about it being funded from section 94 rural roads and this recommendation says from section 7 to 11 rural roads and i 'm i 'm not clear whether they 're just two to two different terms for the same thing i 've never heard of section 7.11 before where the funds have come from and what they 're resilient section 11 7 11 are the new standards under the epna act that 's the new number for old section 94. good um the provisions haven 't changed only the numbers okay so it 's developer contributions that go into that 's correct and my second question is is it intended that we would acquire the whole corner of that property from the existing intersection up to the new alignment or would it just be a strip through the property and if so what happens to the little bit of the corner that 's been cut off and separated by the neura good question at this point in time i would suspect it 's to add additional road reserve um if the council was of mine to sell what was left at another point in time they have that opportunity um it would just be a matter of so we 'd be quiet acquiring the whole corner yes that 's my understanding with the from what the manner has indicated can i write a recall just to clear up the closing of hampton the people are coming up through taranawa and the cars going to mayfield gardens on their little tomtoms but if you are out on the road on a saturday or sunday afternoon this is a shortcut that the people from o 'connell used to go to the garbage dump and uh yeah you 've met quite a lot of people um i grew up councillor trenbath sometimes there 's no one on the road and other times of knock off from tradesmen that are coming from different spots in the district that the roads just flat out for a short burst in the morning and in the afternoon one of the things i do notice is the amount of people coming to the garbage tip from their call and they use that right as a shortcut you 're only one that 's 390. i 'll put the motion all in favor all right [Music] item 1304 policy 1101 code of meeting practice recommendations of council place the proposed amendment for the current model code of meeting practice policy 1101 on public exhibition for a period of be adopted as presented for the benefit of some counsellors the item is only if you look on this page 61 paragraph 5.19 a it is the change from only to visual so it allows us to use audio visual instead of just audio recordings so i have a do i have a proposal or a segment carson gibbon counselor uh someone different thank you mr mayor i and i 'd also um commend the uh council staff for doing a markup it doesn 't make this these things lot easier and very easy to understand just a quick question before i move the recommendation with the ability to live stream audiovisual in june 22 when is it proposed that we would be putting through the amendment to the model code of many practices referenced in the third last paragraph on page 60. through the chair we 'll be looking to or to workshop that late february or march does it need to be workshopped or um through the chair as part of your induction as new counsellors you have a responsibility to look at those within six months of there to say that this is what we 're proposing to change so that this will continue on june 2012. so i just remember i thought it was december this year though i thought it was early tonight i threw it through the chair um we 've only been councillors since december yeah so there 's an obligation that you need to look at these documents within six months of you becoming a counsellor we put this one through because it 's easy and there 's concern over we bought new technology and we 're we 're doing the audio visual and if we don 't amend our this now yeah it could lapse yeah so we don 't want that to happen the the major component of a review of your code of meeting practice as well as your code of conduct is a mandatory thing that you must do as counselors we will workshop the entire document together and the bits that you need to discuss and to be comfortable with as counselors we will include or will amend accordingly and that will then be brought back to this document is purely to enact the audio visual component of meetings and the ability to be able to do that through audio visual means rather than just audio as our existing code and learning practices so um the attendance by councillors audio visually or otherwise at council meetings i thought that aspect of lapses at a certain date and i thought it was december 2020 that 's 2022 is that correct that will be part of how you will determine your model code okay so certain so there will be a proposed amendment for that workshop that would take into account that i would think that there will be a number of americans that as councils sit here would want to be included or not as part of moral codes of conduct and i 'm happy to move this recommendation practice is like any document it has black ink in it it has sections which are printed in red egg which are the areas that we have an expression to adjust there is a significant number of them and then they cut each coat of medium practice and they workshop is the best way of doing them and it may take us a little while maybe quick i don 't know all right any other comments nope all right 1305 the requestable waiver of chip fees recommendation is that the council provide 500 in kind to the oberon community centre outlet to be used for disposable unwanted donated goods that are unsuitable for sale to be accepted at the over on tip to be funded from section 356 donations allocation and two the council placed the request on public exhibition for a period of 28 days should no submissions be received during that time the allocation we made to the oberon community center outlet by way of tip vouchers do i have murder councilman kevin and counseling copy um thank you mr mayor i note that um the overall community centre provides valuable recycling or a place for recycling and that though obviously in doing that will will on occasions obtain unwanted goods that cannot be recycled so i think this is this is encouraging recycling while at the same time realizing the reality of the situation that certain _''_9360.88 to move the recommendation i 've just asked in the heading it says request for waiver i think there 's an r missing off wave but apart from that that doesn 't affect the recommendation so i 'm more than happy to move the recommendation council that 's pretty straightforward they do a good job there my only disappointment is that we really shouldn 't exclude mattresses but you know we can 't_''_9390.319 do that that 's what you want to do all right thank you anyone else for the motion all in favor that 's nervous item 1306 over on sport complex council working party the council support the recommendations outlined in the report and nominate two councillors to sit on the working party council mccarthy councilman that 's the problem uh just put this up at the previous meeting to try and get this move forward um we 've been going on with just reports back um i think on the proponents we 're dealing with goes forward to rapid pace i think we as a council need to turn that around and form a committee and get away from it and as one of the people that spoke prior to the meeting here is if you go over with junior league and something over there you cannot hear the referees on the food and that 's the two million dollars that four tools given us is only a peppercorn because they got the benefit of supplying their material for that factory which is state government owned creating the problem that we 've got to move these foods so what we need to do is get this going i take it the da 's approved now isn 't it we need to sack that person hey that 's a director who 's a grpp the people this is what i can 't understand we engage people that know the jop requirements so all this should be there really to go through if you ever mean like if you got to go and have a traffic plan that you know off that roundabout that you 've got out of a traffic lane the people that we engage to do this should know what 's going on so the rta understand the comment that council 's made that as part of an integrated authority each integrated authority has the potential to come back and ask for additional information so regardless of what you put in as a as an applicant they have that ability to ask for that information [Music] that 's that 's the process but i realize that but if you already do submit what 's required then they don 't have to come back to you in other words if you need a 500 metre slip lane off that roundabout our consultant should have known that council mccarthy that 's this is this is getting away from what i know it is motion and i 'd like to get on with the motion that 's fine thank you for your saying flexibility um and councilman um no i 'm happy i think i think we need a committee to to keep this going ahead and to involve um if it make the community feel they 're more involved as i think they have been but obviously there 's a feeling out there that they 're not being are two issues again um there are no terms of reference we need to have terms of reference and the other thing is the working party needs to be both council and all interested uh sporting organizations because although it 's the potential playing services for rugby league netball and potentially hockey the access and availability of the recreational facilities in the main building will be open or should be open to all sporting through the chair um the report highlights that the role of this group would be to put a set of terms together the council 's review so whilst like i understand your comment i think that at this point in time if we can get the group organised who can then come back to council with what they believe the terms of reference should look like that would be the time that you can have that discussion okay my my preference would be that um the two councillors who are currently uh on the sporting committee i think that 's council mccarthy and trenbar are on this one i think the general manager and i should in any negotiations as yet i am the one that is now delegated to do so along the general manager and then the rest of it is about groups from within the sporting community uh nominating their people now i 'm very happy to have a long discussion about this but i think that 's that 's a starting point anyway i think the whole council will be involved in making the strategic decisions and doesn 't mean you if you 're not on the group that you can 't provide input to it but decision making becomes more difficult when you have nine people plus all the sporting communities and this is a working group it 's not a it 's not [Music] it 's not a committee so it has much less power but what it has the power to do is to recommend things to council which is all of us that 's that 's where the ability of council delay sorry this council the way the site the working group comes from where are you proposing um an amendment to the recommendation um to follow what reference because well i think i can 't i can 't i think through the chair the recommendation is to support the recommendations outlined in the report report highlights that once the committee is established a set of terms is developed and then that 's reported back to council so so what you are asking is within the report i 'm simply trying to minimize the angst given that council needs to resolve what they want to do for this committee sorry this working party and the terms will then dictate who this working party reports to because it couldn 't report back through the sports facilities but we haven 't_''_9836.08 we haven 't got a recommendation that actually knows who 's going to sit on this so we we assume that the general manager and the mayor will sit on it because of their negotiations with born with other entities involved with this previously uh including state government i think um and there 's been a proposal that the people on the sports committee should be the other council delegates on this committee um that shouldn 't that be proposed so it needs a number two so i 'm asking that 's what mastermind there is proposing an amendment or an addition i 'm i was proposing initially just to get people thinking about what it would be um i 'm happy to make it an amendment and will do so but it 's just the starting point and we may have a series of amendments after that and that 's fine we 'll get we 'll get to the place so i am proposing an amendment um the council leave the current one this is the preamble and nominate two councils work this is a work party being councillor mccarthy and councillor trenbath as well as the general manager and mayor and that 's regularly hockey and metal communities have not have delegates and other sporting organizations in oberon also have the opportunity to send delegates and i think that should be in three parts yeah this exporting organizations and be invited to be uh all right i 've already spoken to that foreign extra time council attacker nothing to address to me thank you any other comments appointed to the sports facilities committee obviously more but um were you an officer or okay what he knows about engineering and things like that and the relationship with paul um yeah i i think he should be on the committee whether we have the three or not i i honestly think we just it was just an oversight and we should have three people on it i don 't even slow down because i don 't think there 'd be any dillian dallying about we 're just going to have to address all these things and get on with it but uh yeah i i think council may technically be a great asset on that committee if it 's changed your mind yeah i 'd support that too i think with um councilman kevin 's contact with sporting clubs and his uh his previous contacts before et cetera i think would be an android a good a good addition well i 'll go as it alternates yes guys there 's a little curve because that little one about the sports complex as such but it 's not really about that 's not not related to the topic i 'm just uh interested to know about uh based on the current layout and i know that could change subject to the work of this working party but uh do we have any very broad cost estimates based on the current layout and how do they compare with the almost seven million dollars currently available um through the chair we 're working on that now with the with the partner in public and that 's ongoing um just i i okay as i wasn 't sure if now is the right time to ask these questions anyway uh secondly based on what mr sullivan said earlier i understand that the complex would come under council ownership um absolutely and final question is uh just if you can broadly outline what the arrangements for the league 's club itself would be as opposed to the football side but uh that you 'll climb through the chair at this point in time the scope of the project is like for light current day standard so a leaks club would need to be incorporated leagues club sits would be owned by the league 's club not by council or owned by councillor no no it 'll be all under council ownership as it is with some sort of lease to the club for the comments um i 'll preface it by saying that that will be a decision for council at the appointed time however i don 't see why there will be a change but i can 't uh it 'll be a council decision to make thank you some of the facts tend to do early on tonight aren 't quite directed i don 't think the amount of money was correct and what council paid for that ground and what it 's valued at so oh you mean the 4.8 million for the rugby league round yeah so i think that 's no no i i i just i don 't want to go on a debate but yeah and i don 't know whether council tucker knows that the council owned the league comp at the moment the white sets i just have a small question if that land and the person right what 's going to be happening to that land um through the chair if you sell a parcel in the end of the open for whatever the uses that are permissible on that land would we have the factory coming closer once again i 'm going to be very succinct in my answers there is an issue of how close the industrial site can come if it 's used for administration that 's a different matter production there is limits to our place and what use is permissible on that zoned land that is approved for use and a number of things would need to occur depending on what that use was i don 't know i 'm trying to stipulate that under the i know what it 's so the land is currently industrial the the sports facility the sports ground is zoned industrial so as such any industry that gets approval to [Music] go on that land can go on that land but this will be a decision point this will be another matter for council and at the moment we haven 't even got until we get a degree of certainty with that we really can 't progress the reason why the working party can 't put things together and start doing some of the the negotiation with the various sporting organizations and understanding what they want or what they need it 's you know sure as hell hockey is a lot different than that and they 've got all different needs through through the chair just to make it easy for council i indicated to councils as part of our ongoing development that i 'll be doing giving you some briefings on different things and projects that we have um last week we did the hub before our briefing and the next one i think i 'll do is the sports crowd to give council some indication on where we 're up to in that question one more quick question um regardless of any proponent purchasing any land council can still progress with its sports ground undergrads through through the chair we currently have approximately seven million dollars in grant funds to do the to do we have a plan a and we but yes you 're right we 've got seven million dollars to do that that 's true but that 's probably a long way okay um any other comments all right i 'll put the motion in the form for the amendment oh sorry the minute the amendment i put the amendment in four parts you wish me to root it out put the amendment all those in favor synonymous so the amendment now becomes the motion and i put the motion all in favor um all right uh item 1401 the monthly activity report for the general manager my recommendation is that the report for iodine 1401 is received as information do i have a mover given a second question sorry i have some um why just and it may appear and i know it 's in the action items uh across the um the rural council areas but um it might be appropriate here i just wonder where we 're going the stp because um i 'm i 'm obviously concerned that we have received uh some indicative pricing some time ago for this um we do seem we we did a few things to try and ensure that this could continue on during the um um the what 's it called the the period between two councils taking effect uh caretaker period thank you for those words uh but we haven 't seem to have an update and to my mind uh this is a crucial project for overall i 'm worried about cost escalation and everything else in the current employment so i just we need i just want to know if we 're going to meet the working committee is going to be moving a meeting um we 've been falling behind i believe in what was our original timeline so can you just give us an update on that please because i know there have been some health issues but despite the health issues we really need to get this going through the chair there 's been significant health issues with our special progress engineer that person is now getting better and i 'm looking to have that as soon as that is [Music] because um as we all know pricing for materials and we do have a good relationship with the contractor who is putting the design and construct together for us and we we do talk to those people on a semi-regular basis who are putting this together before before the health issue there was a number of meetings that we had trying to get the best possible outcome for the facility in fact what they 've done was reduce the costs associated with with that so that will go some way to alleviate some of the concerns that you raise which are quite relevant but i would like our special projects has had integral parts and conversations with all the right players in the room so we 're all over the right information at the right time even if that 's a zoom meeting that we have to set up to have that that 's what we 'll be looking to do well i believe it 's getting to the crucial area even if it is a zoom medium don 't have a problem with that and then because i i assume that then we will need some quick decisions by been done through decisions exactly so i am also aware that we need to you know move move it along as i 've said um on a positive note that hasn 't appeared in my uh merrell mint because it only happened at the end last week was a very now for the recommendation from andrew g to the um funding authority for our uh grant fund uh it was that 2.3 million [Music] [Music] it 's just that the increase in costs but that grant may cover the increase in costs the way things are going um i have a number of questions which i did uh raise with you um general manager so i will read them and it relates principally to page 68 about a third of the way down and the number of separations in the last three months i 'm just asking for what areas of operations did these departures occur do you want me to do you want me to read them all and then ask what do you want me to do through the chair you read yours first and then i 'll 'm happy with that i 'm not i 'm not particular on how it occurs uh the reasons for such a high level of departures to the extent they can be revealed whether they 're likely to be any more departures whether these departures have any impact on the morale or health of other council workers the likely of potential effects on council 's delivery plan for 2020-22 and capital works program um noting the director of technical services raises reports some resourcing issues where the council policies have responded appropriately in a timely fashion to these departures and obviously you 'll appreciate the council this is this is not a question it 's just to comment that the council 's own duty to their staff for health safety and well-being to understand if the work environment and to understand if the work environment is not conducive to a safe effective and productive work of course that community demands us as councils so firstly thank you for giving me the question for me so i can attitudely address it but in relation to the questions pose off the following responses six months council has seen departures increased beyond what we would consider normal however currently it is normal in this environment especially in the labor force both locally regionally and statewide the great resignation only needs to be put into a google search engine to validate the fact council is seeing departures across the organization and we are actively seeking to have those positions filled this is reported monthly within the general manager 's monthly activity where i provide an overview of where the where those discrepancies or where those actions are i know the commentary regarding the concern with work health and safety matters and direct counsellors to the whs update on page 67 of this report you can see that in this space council is tracking very well which i hope addresses the concerns and queries of the council the council 's query regarding the ongoing operational plan and the potential impacts on staff turnover i can advise that where there is a staff shortage appropriate short-term contractors have been engaged to assist in delivering one of the biggest operational plans on record that with the appropriate processes any adverse impacts on the delivery of the operational plan should this vary council will be made aware the more pressing issue for councils across new south wales and us is the current covered pandemic and the continued need to isolation of staff finally in relation to council policies i advise that a number exists to assist council in this area council prides itself on its well-being policies endorsed by council the whs policies which help keep our staff safe and the industrial policies that allow the due process to occur sorry due process to be conducted under the legislat the legitimate requirements of the 2020 award everyone has a responsibility for work health and safety with the person conducting the business undertaking sitting directly with the general manager i take this responsibility very seriously and react accordingly to keep staff safe this is currently outlawed within council 's work health and safety policy i hope and trust that this adequately addresses the queries um i just say that we haven 't had so many employees separate i understand what you 're saying it 's occurring but a three month other counselors and they 're certainly in three months haven 't had 15 percent of their workforce i believe to separate it just seems highly unusual that there is such a high separation rate in a in a three-month period noting that there was none in september none in october and then suddenly november december january would go to 10. councillor i think tomorrow last six months we 've seen that we 've seen the change i note your comments i said i have looked at the council on home and sent 15 of their workforce again in three months but that 's a common one that 's all i have i 'm happy to [Music] move the report um be accepted by council hi both i just had one comment i did look at the numbers myself and my position was i presumed it 's going to be covered and the great presentation that we are seeing i mean i said you looked at other councils and i had written down that question for gary to say how would that compare to say bachelor planning or let 's go might have the answer to that question um the other thing is i 've worked in um corporations where 100 turnover is 50 normal and it 's accepted and just it 's not great but it happens through the care through the chair as i 've indicated before this is not normal but it 's normal in the industry that we 're seeing um yeah a couple of issues with this report i had the same concerns regarding the staff turnover how long were they here and why did they go but i also have a concern on page 65 and 66. i notice you 're talking a lot about vaccinated stuff what about your unvaccinated style through the chair we only have one unvaccinated stuff but still this is very ambiguous to just list it as being of one why not just say staff and leave that little portion out instead of writing vaccinated stuff should take a rap test as soon as possible why not just say staff should your issues are noted any other comments first is at the bottom of page 68 under recruitment i 'm able to comment on on the degree of interest in the cfo position and secondly our request an update on uh what 's happening with filling the director 's position please through the chair can i tell you next thursday tuesday um we recruit we 're going through a recruitment phase for the fourth time for our surfo what we 've done is change tact in how we name that position we are we 've renamed it a financial manager there has been no change to the delegations or the requirements we 've just changed the name of the position and we are interviewing four candidates next week which is very exciting from what we 've had before um in regards to the director you 're currently in the vicinity of an acting director once the new position for finance manager slash cfo flash financial controller is put in place we 'll be quickly making a decision on how we proceed with the the thank you and my other question is on page 72 near the bottom fourth effect it 's really just my own curiosity because i 've been and reginald and kay 's advisory committee i haven 't heard of that committee before is that part of the overall national parks advisory committee no no it 's a committee that 's been put together through the trust to oversee the um improvements and ongoing updates to general case itself right brian harmon as a person that 's got extensive knowledge of janelle and case was asked to sit on that as a community representative he just come along give me an update on whether up to and asked a few questions of counsel to see if he could uh facilitate some some work he 's um as you 're no doubt aware he is huge into buying and the last thing he wants to see is a lot of money spent on a facility and then fire that we 've had less than two years ago thank you i just hadn 't heard of the committee yeah okay just just wonder the general manager um if someone lodges a complaint it goes to hr is that right the chair that depends on what the complaint is okay it you 've got and where do they lodge that do they put an envelope put in a box or or what who does it go to direct it to the general manager okay so someone lower down goes to their director and then it goes up the chain and it 's recorded not necessarily okay it just depends on what that is all right so say for instance if i take offense with someone hypothetically stake them in the truckload so does that then go to chris or something like that and then chris deals with it is it recording yeah it 's a complaint made yes okay that 's okay that 's thank you anymore oh item 1402 there must be activity report for planning development and the recommendations of this the report being item 1402 is received information report if i could make ask a couple of questions of the vector recommendation uh paragraph one on page 73 notes that was very busy month in november december and january 22 with more than double the previous year 's development applications lodged i note that and i 'm assuming that because i note that in particular on 76 about the fourth this column down in the applications lodge table there 's one lodge on the 28th of september 21 where the reviewers come in 16th of november and still hasn 't had a determination essence had a determination in the last few days so that 's that 's quite a lengthy period we 're looking at 28 september we 're now into that 's october november december three months four months four and a half five months really sorry if you look in the applications lodge table go to the the first line shade of the pinky color or orangey color then go three down from that it 's 10.2 2021 71.1 yep lodged and remember we said lodge was the date when everything was put in that was needed to be lodged rather than the date that the sub-portal was open so the commencement date for review of that was the 16th of november yet we still haven 't received a determination and there 's been no stock of clock date so that 's been nearly five months if you say october november december january and a half of i think it 's four and a half months um and there are a number of others obviously there 's one two four no there 's one about four down the seventh of october started to look at the 12th of october and again hasn 't had a determination so there are quite a few outstanding i appreciate um is there any i know you 've already engaged contractors to assist is there any means of sort of alleviating this this backlog through the chair um thank you for the question there are a number more i i 've just gone to the oldest um and i 'm not without knowing the application potential reason that we made mr stop the clock i 'm not too sure but uh there could be a reason behind those um delays in the applications again staffing has been uh an issue but uh yeah so i mean there 's more fourth of november 8th to november sort of they started to review but so there 's quite a few i haven 't_''_11920.64 with the earlier ones so most of the ones on page 76 that don 't have a determined date or determination day to stop the clock day um thank you um i note that there are still issues with the planning portal through i assume department of planning dpia and they still have leading problems um through the chair mentions yes thank you but i think that should be noted in the under the over on weight facility 73 i 'm sorry page 73 last fourth of the page and it talks about maine 's power there now i know we looked at maine 's power for this facility but then and maybe i 've i 've forgotten something but on 74 it talks about solar power for the facility has been scoped a contractor engaged to complete the works anticipated that solar panel will provide more than enough power including battery back actually adequately run at the facility so you can just remind me what we 're getting in overhead power for if that 's i think it was wasn 't it that would be the moment that 's i think um the only other thing i thought was of interest if i couldn 't go to page 81. two graphs of the number of cats and dogs in town in 2021 i was i understood the top graph that was 2021 then i 'm assuming the one below obviously it 's 2022 which has got nothing in the dark blue the green or the brown orangey for the cats the green for dogs and the 2022 carryover now but it 's got the 2021 cats and dogs um lime but at the end of it it 's right up in the air whereas the graph above for december is right down and i 'm thinking it should replicate what 's above i 'm just not understanding that but maybe that 's my i don 't understand cats and dogs in town so through the chair the graphic of the blue line represents 20 into 21 yes 1 in 22 represents what the 21 dogs and cats total were so that the reason why that 's high is because there was six impounded in 21 so does that make maybe it was a cat that had kittens but i i think let 's move on i think we 'll leave it i 'm happy to move this recommendation [Music] one of the things while we push to get this table in there commencement dates show that we have 43 applications that haven 't been being commenced 43 i know that there 's people out there waiting on their house planes to be supplied they can 't start because they can 't get the things off council to get started and it 's been in for a long time so don 't we need more staff from this should we be throwing more resources and as indicated before the general manager said he was prepared to stand up because he 's a planner so shouldn 't we be acting on this um during that um through the chair we 're we 're actively trying to recruit in this space it 's traditionally difficult we 've interviewed for that position and my understanding is that it 's ongoing that we should have some sort of indication soon in a planning space in this space in order to deal with this i also have to make sure that our budgets don 't escalate to a point where you ask me questions about why i 've mismanaged um employment operations in this space so we have to do it within our budgetary means which is what we 're trying to do um mr manager i don 't agree with you there because the people lodged a fee and the fee is for that service so we need buns on seats to get these approved i 'm sorry but it doesn 't wash well the washing is that you need to have the right people to do with the projects and that 's what we 're trying to do with why recruitment so we 've got a recruitment and in that space because of the amount that we have we will be possibly looking to extend those contractors in order to do that but i have to say that we we do have budgetary constraints that we need to be aware of but the budget matches the fee application fee doesn 't it no their application fee for they have the accounts to go through it to do the assessment that 's right it doesn 't necessarily meet the requirements of how much we spend on that okay all right i 'll give you that one and at the front it 's got r regulated services i just can 't understand who are these people that we 've employed to do this and why for a start what was commented there you don 't need main spout to run away bridge i don 't know where you find this and if these people advising you get rid of them because farmers load and hay and grain have battery way bridges so you don 't need mains power and as for the mains power mr christy johnson tells me that he 's only been given a preliminary access to have it surveyed he hasn 't given the ok to run the power lines for his property i don 't know about the other program so please it doesn 't take that long to get a quote and approved by essential energy which it has to as long as this process being taken because when was it back in october when we met out there chris you know through the chair through the chair integrals contract is the one assisting in this process and they 're the ones who are doing this who 's that yes they have been engaged to do this process for us so we can 't do it any quicker than the person who we engaged to do it okay so they are the ones that have are doing this on our behalf to try and short track that process that we 're looking at and we 've got an update report from uh through the chair at the minute they 're looking at alternate options uh in terms of seeking there wasn 't a letter of objection from one of those property owners he 's been looking at alternative options now for us as opposed to running the power changing it back up and closing that road with the bundle so that 's what we 've asked um we would like to go back to the opposing property owner to have see if there is any other room for overturning that decision of what they 've indicated today okay thank you and the other thing i 'll as i assume we didn 't try the terror handle that 's fair enough the other thing i 'm disappointed in is we 've started this office out there we put a 3000 liter septic tank in and it 's a pump out so in other words the thing gets full you pop a thousand liters out of it because you can 't pump it right out because it 'll pop out of the ground so we have this thing now that every fortnight or every so many days we have this massive cost of having someone coming in a contract and bump this thing out it 's ludicrous why it wasn 't accepting a trench put there and if we 're too close why didn 't_''_12491.68 we move it to the other side of the road and have the septic absorption trench and i i just can 't understand it we don 't want to put a toilet in hervey david park because of the um tip for this pump air like it 's i don 't know what a load of charging but i 'd say there 's a 120 150 minimum and you can 't pump all the tank out like i said maybe you pump it all out ground pink pops out of the ground so surely goodness didn 't_''_12526.319 we do some homework and look at maybe one of them chlorinated ones where you actually put a hose out and water your trees or whatever like that they 're they 're in other locations around the district and it has no boundary restrictions sure there 's tablets in it the awts 's which is aerated three percent still failed nova the the the height of them because they freeze there 's an issue with aerated simple trenches are a much better way of dealing with things the decision was made for the pump out was purely i believe on the basis of use and the limited use that it would get rather than spending money on a on a system that might not necessarily meet the requirements of how system but that doesn 't stop us from not going back and putting a septic trench in should that become an issue down the track but the decision was made on the basis that it was the best option to initially get that service operating efficiently and effectively but how long have we been in the office three weeks good less than three weeks two weeks less than three weeks and it 's already been called the pump out speak through the chair speaking of the plumber the the water was there 's quite lot of water within the tank initially to keep it there he indicates uh you know take his word as an expert that no there 's a there 's a there 's going to be a um hasn 't_''_12645.439 been on yet a ball system that will come up i 'll show the certain heights and that 's that takes per the instruction from the plumber okay all right um there 's another one out there too um it 's gotten in beat at the moment but yeah anyway let 's get going if i think 's worthless i 'm sorry the bottom of page 73 advanced regulatory services who were the consultants we got to provide advice thank you that was a good morning oh yes advisors on what we should do with the um with the waste the waste centre and how to improve it and they provided quite a lengthy report they 've obviously been engaged to trial a telehandler front-end loader but have recommended a rubber tired loader but and that 's at the bottom of page 73 but then on the next page it says that they 're investigating impossible to use this around the trolling of a telehandler well if they think that that the front end loader is going to be suitable why are they trolling the tiller handle instead of the front end loader and um if it 's a front end loader i don 't wish to promote anyone in particular but i do know that drake 's haulage have a front-end loader that they may hire and they 're in oberon um they 're actually going to quote them to do work before with their front-end 'm sure that summer rain would be arranged with just trial and error tip i don 't counsel mccarthy i might know or tucker might know someone else but i certainly know that drake 's you know okay i think i think we 've exhausted that but the question is why they filing a telehandler or is that an error through the chair um it 's the australian recommendation for the uh rubber type of it 's council college of telling england as per the nation um just done projects third project over and off police dog partners and just fix that to leash and the independent living units how are the carports progressing are they almost finished for the chair of the space car carport has been completed uh it 's just the two card space uh it needs to be completed waiting on some rookie materials that wasn 't delivered with the with the carports as as it should have been we 've gone back to the shed company to get that i know what 's the other one no no no very important there 's no um the generator has been used there should be a description out there that 's when that 's so that those doors must be up and ventilation in that room when they 're generated and it needs to be there before the generator 's allowed to be used through the chair also councilman clario 's um the generator will be relocated to the old storage shed and he 's stored in there we 'll have some ventilation and that 'll come back to the the office and charge that and then once the solar goes on it 'll be able to uh boost the batteries by turning yourself on and off uh in the future what are we going to do no the leader come across the it 'll be elevated above the ground thank you now this is pretty solid okay this is a temporary measure well i 'm a bit bewildered for the solar because i thought the main big solar was about 20 000. but i thought council asked for some solar just enough to run the efos machine and i thought that was the nose motion the efrost machine in respect that the staff go out there if the solar panels aren 't they 've got to refuse the use of this thing until there 's enough sun on the batteries brought up to speed um through the chair we need to give our staff the whs requirements that says that they can go on turn the walls [Music] [Music] item 1403 recommendations report item 1403 's receipt of information and technical services report delivering second please council given um thank you mr mayor there 's definitely been a huge amount of work being done currently on burrica and campbell 's river roads um and a number of other noonan 's hill road today but a few and it 's great to see the amount of activities um and i think people in the council areas are appreciating that there are a large number of potholes and a lot of roads affected by potholes but they certainly appreciate that it has been very wet and it 's um the council has a real task ahead of it to fully maintain and keep these roads maintained with the last four months um i suppose the only only question i 'd have and it was raised the other night at a a community association meaning that i just asked the director of technical services could note and i did actually note it tonight coming in that both on burriga road and on campbell 's river road once the activity has stopped the work stopped a lot of the signs still remain out such as reduced speed traffic control ahead but there 's no traffic control because everyone 's finished work and at the end when you get to when you go to 60 or 40 there 's no sign at the end of it that says end of work so theoretically if i go onto borrego road tonight outside my place i would have been going 40 kilometers an hour all the way i believe to black springs because it was only at the end of black springs and i then got another 100 kilometers an hour because there was another 40 60 and 40 on the campbell 's river road but again it wasn 't something to say run the whole of the campbell 's river road at 60 and 40. and this was raised by the community of barringer the other night that someone 's not turning the signs down or you know and what happens as you 'll appreciate in those circumstances that people tend to ignore them after a while because well they 're always out they 're not down it 's like people who keep their stock signs out on the road um so maybe i don 't have to make a comment but maybe just um make a note to the work staff or the um contractor that you know a little love more attention to the signs might assist um there was a comment made and i can raise it directly but at the black springs community association there was a hell of a pothole on dog rocks road that has markings around it that has been there for over six weeks and if council could do something with it i can raise that via an email or something apart from that so i commend the director of technical services on the it 's great very detailed and i have seen some of that with the signage but i think i think it 's just work control which probably should be told to finish the job like they should and get paid for um the only other thing that i think is um it 's probably not communicated well enough to the community how much work you are doing and what work is ongoing and the best piece of information i get is the good news it usually has it all in there and i actually had a question can i use all of this and just put it out there because it really does tell a good story and you sort of get tired of people going to six months when am i going to do this where in actual fact you do actually have a schedule of work and it should be pushed out then um through the chair good news week is a is a weekly piece of advice and update that we give to councillors we also give it to staffing so because they sometimes don 't know it because the good news week tells the right story it really does about what we are doing so i suggest you should get it or a synopsis of it or a cut down when you go to community associations black springs o 'connell and burger through the chair we generally do that through the community newsletter to give an overview on that but it 's probably too late look i think what cancer tremble is getting at is is that we need to take the bits out of it and get it out push it out out there on friday that is the whole reason why i put it out we give it to you the thing is is that the reason why it hasn 't been used as a update to the community about what we 're doing is that one times out of 10 what you get back is well they do that but you don 't do it on my road and it opens up that conversation that we don 't necessarily want to invoke this is what happens i think they know the volume of it 's not just localized spots they might see the oponent or they might see that i absolutely know which is why we give to our councillors so they can also assist in getting that information but occasionally there are things in it that probably are not relevant and that 's concerning and that 's and that 's fine and that 's that 's where judgment needs to be exercised news fits like the work that the technical service department is doing in other departments the most influential thing about brains and just to appease council and the kingdom there are often times when we do a good news week for staff and we do a good news week for councillors if there are times when we 're giving you a good news week for councillors there is a reason behind it so some of the information in that might not be for public dissemination so we try not to do that because we 're trying to give that message to to you all but sometimes we use it as an avenue to provide information to you just a couple mount road we 'll kick that off that way first then until road um have we achieved the 70 metre road construction in the six metre seal good man um not in all localities if we didn 't feel the beam around the rock for the bedrock uh if we started coming or chipping away uh there 's also the new supplies pipeline through that location so we had to make a well-educated decision we supported new south wales as to what we could do and what we couldn 't do so yeah there 's only a minor or a couple of minor locations that it doesn 't meet the seven major expect okay um and then on the campbells river road i don 't know like director mentions for gary that a truck went over on friday um i was out there the dam and it doesn 't seem to be any compaction on the verge or on the batter and you can see where it 's just given away where the truck is but the concern from the people that use the road is that there 's no can actually see is there a scope of works that we 've given to the people that carried out the work is it eight meters wide plus the banner yes the uh project infrastructure engineer is in control of that particular project there i went there to site today to have a bit of a look um following the two incidents uh there is a location that certainly is little bit softer and in particular one location and it would be normal practice obviously to have a roadside batter no doubt um three to one where you can get it not always not always always achievable depending on fence lines unlike in the the alignment yes the pavement is um aimed at meeting eight meters and i think that in a particular location where full hogan had an incident they did drive too close to the edge i 'm not conceding that it probably shouldn 't have had more batter particularly there i 'm not saying that that would have actually stopped them from what actually did occur so being mindful of that yes it does it does help having edges um not always a chival but yeah to maximize it and get compaction on the outer outer edges of your road so there are some locations that do need some additional work from my observations this afternoon yeah i believe that one of the local contractors is that concern and and he 's gone off to state forest to see that something can be done and making that road a bit more safer and i measured the road to one spot there on friday and it was only 7.7 metres wide so that 's a foot shorter than what it should be contracted to so we need to go out and i honestly think we should engage someone to check the compaction because we could be liable here if this road fails because those log trucks are up here and the loads flipping about like that and if they 've got to get over it 's not as if it 's like a load of gravel or something like that what you remember we 're constructing a road project which is lifelike so we are not being careful being a standard payment label could be three and a half meters so seven meters i mean even if we 've got 80 meters still there now there is a provision there for it to be mind marked if we do see fit with the outer edge lines of course with that shoulder and i mean not always is the shoulder always used uh and shouldn 't be used only corrective actions and necessary actions when driver behavior or something how that occurs when you can make those directions so i 'm not trying to discount the fact that the whole payment shouldn 't have a natural compaction where possible there is a section that permitted that uh ease-off question as i mentioned in my last statement so um those correct productions will be discussed and had some remedial um actions from it and one on the other side of the crossroads back towards barrica i know this is and it hasn 't got the high batter like the other part is but there 's been no cross rolling a lot like occurred on the lowest main road is there any or i notice it lands well i think like we 've got this two-way conversation going and the rest of us are sitting around here and well they can can you can you wind this up and come out and to say i think so well i 'm trying to get to the safety side of the thing okay we 've had two truck accidents i realize we have a batter that 's not standing up to it and and you 've made that point this is legally clear okay and those two matters are being investigated but what i 'm getting at is if we had a process in place it wouldn 't have got to that stage absolutely [Music] and if you see something that you believe is a work health and safety issue you should put it straight to the general manager these people have apparently gone off the state forest to see if they can put some influence into it because they consider it dangerous and the the way our policy is written for work health and safety is that anyone who sees something that they okay the issue that clyde 's raising and i think chris touched him before i just went on like as part of the grant that was accepted to do campbell 's river road there were certain things that council couldn 't do and we have to be mindful of that so the replacement work being if it was seven meters wide there it has to be seven meters it can 't_''_13738.479 be nine meters or whatever we take the point about as chris has said some of the the um compaction on the edges is something that we that i 've asked for a report on because there has been two incidents there and we 're looking to find out whether they are related whether they are completely different and those things will be considered as part of that as chris remediation works with the contractor who did all right i 'm going to put the motion report have you got something that 'll be different to what 's being talked about already yeah so i 've got a few i have fairly brave questions but i was going to a lot of discussion about that i did send an email to the gym and the director so i assume there 'll be a response in due course and maybe that should go for all counsellors in light of the conversation just just from council 's information anyone who generally sends us information you know one-on-one gets disseminated between all councils um second question is page 86 first time from learning road my question on that was with the culvert replacement at the fish river to know what is the culvert size and was there some sort of catchment analysis done to determine that culvert size or do we have any idea whether or not it 's likely to overclock uh through the chair um you look certainly don 't have any hydrology and catch behavior other than to say that uh it is widespread obviously uh flooding or white spotting when it does occur um damn does topple the analysis on the running jet certainly has holes and structural failure from our observations and therefore we were looking to certainly get bigger capacity of greater flow under that particular any longer with regard to fish habitat and the like therefore the vox culvert replacement was proposed by no means and was indicated to cancel the time that would still be subject to inundation um so really whatever structure you put there certainly will still always be subject to likewise flooding yeah so i know it would still happen from time to time i was just interested whether the analysis and whether we knew how often that that might happen like one in 20 years or 10 or five or fifteen i don 't really have that information sorry counselor at this stage a wonderful thing um page 87 middle of the page water and sewer i think it 's an error crews have completed 75 percent of the whole slain water main is that the wrong line there 's just no work being done in hollister in development uh through the chair on the slain down off uh earl street that 's true yes so there has been some work certainly conducted down there with maine 's renewal with our clients okay i 'll have another look i 'm bridges for swallows in australia and bald retro uh yeah um at this stage a review of environmental factors is to be sent to fisheries for permit for construction the indications from our engaged contractor murray valley piling who was the successful tenderer indicated that they will be available during march and subject to permits being in place ready to commence the prefabricated structures are and materials are already ready to go so following their current commitment with another engagement they will be um intending on moving that project in march thank you final question uh it comes from the calendar december the 16th regional roads with classification conditions i 'm interested to know what 's the current situation with the regional road tree classification have those decisions been made about which roads would move from one category to another and if not when will that happen applications close on the 28th of february we have three nominations at this point out of probably road to state campbell river road to regional and albion street to the state yeah and i thought that had i thought those applications had gone was a priority round to start with which we identified those three roads as well um we were asked to lodge with everyone else thank you for your submission having a second goal at the same this is round one the first one they consider a priority man we 're in gate we were encouraged to apply those for those three roads and they didn 't get any outcome so we were then encouraged to do this again yeah i i do have some concerns about that but i don 't want to take everyone 's time there because that will take more time is it too late to have a another separate discussion with yourself and the director are those applications in and or those yeah yeah okay well and they will resolve more counselling yeah i know they were resolved i 'll just have to hope they don 't get approved the second time well i think as a counselor you 're obliged to hope they get approved correct um correct i wasn 't part of the and item 1404 month activity fourth public services the recommendation is move through a second of these council you 're moving i saw you first [Music] that uh the report will be received as information all right item 1405 stated investments that council receive report item 1405 as information and second degrees um no i 've got no uh i 'm happy to have seconded um noting that interest rates are rising slightly we may get some better yields in the future um in that basis um i 'm hoping we 're not walking in too too long-term that we have an opportunity to take the benefit of those rates as they rise item 1406 is received as information delivering second please councillor hayden johnson uh yeah it 's a comprehensive report i 'd like to um see a few more different grant applications going in but it 's very comprehensive um i think mr mayor it 's um it 's very pleasing to see that we received or notified on the 30th of november with a confidentiality agreement um being left on the third of february for three projects the new amenities and shower block of the reef reserve the dog park the accessible toilet the over on golf course [Music] it 's also no noting that we have a whole lot of applications pending and some have been obviously unsuccessful and i note your comment in relation to the item the last item in the table on page 104 which was the 8th of february 2022 upgraded the overall sewage treatment building better agents fund uh six and the letter of support i think you indicated from our federal member g in relation to that um so um i commend the report i think it 's extensive report uh does extensively develop [Music] observations [Music] um just on page 103 um that pursues treatment plant it 's been designed for four and a half thousand yeah and it says from the existing of 3100 100 and we 're talking about 25 to 30 years and the only reason for my question is i was on a a rana um and they did talk about sort of one of the councils that sort of raised the issue that sometimes the and i 'm not sure where these are come from not necessarily two different state government departments that we were actually growing and they refused to believe us because nine other of the group it 's yeah 4500 is is not too bad i know it 's not too bad but i mean it 's still considering the players yes built to be augmented yeah we went through this argument it 's just everything 's moving very differently to what it is if you notice if you notice the people in the room deja vu this has been a long-running thing that we 've had [Laughter] [Music] um do we still have damien do we still have the pamphlet that was given at the complex down today tommel where those people said that there was no facilities for horses in in over an area they said there 's no facilities between sidners and flaming do we still have that contact number that they give out as a penguin the chair i don 't think i 've received a copy of the pamphlet okay well i 'll chase foreign 1407 water and sewer plant report report item 1407 is receiving information the table at um point one of this reported page 105 is probably a bit bigotry at the moment with my nina 100 i 'm assuming well we hope it 's going to continue for some time but i suppose we need to put the readings in or or should we do it by exemption and just do it less frequently or is this just just come straight off the system okay all right i i have no problem with it um obviously the water consumption has obviously decreased in the context of interesting in the high levels of rain have caused some issues with our water treatment plant [Music] and our pump stations um which i suppose is to be expected but um it 's certainly a different situation too which we had a few years ago i 'm happy to um thank you mr murder no comments any other comments information item 14 1408 update of status of council resolutions and the recommendations of the report 1408 has received information and the movement in a second place national cuban council that 's forgiven um thank you as i can actually look at where you 've got to with the status of things and i do um thank the general manager because on most matters we have dates for things to occur which makes it much easier to track and to know where we are um but uh yeah i think it 's it 's a good report and just gives us the status of where we are with a whole lot of issues in one place so i find it very important very happy to move this uh move this report um and the only comment i 'd make and i 've already raised is in relation to progress in the stp which which i 've already talked about so part of it i 'm with the motion all the time 34 gwenevere avenue have we had a look at the septic to see if we can find the best footprint for building there um through the through the chair yeah we 've been on site we 've got the we 've got the um where the where the best location can be so when does that come me the design i 'll be very happy what 's that to draw it up yeah okay and the next one um can you give us the date that the consultant is engaged so we can keep getting an update on this the consultant was engaged last week and i 'll expect some plans back imminently i 've got them engaged to do some additional work on our industrial estate and we 've got two projects that we 'll wait for okay thank you carson thank you mr man uh on page 110 in the community i 'm just a bit disappointed that uh [Music] i think it 's correct that we were going to have a briefing to the whole of council on the hub project i understand that took place as part of the ibs last week but i 'm disappointed that it wasn 't communicating so yeah good any other comments uh put the motion more budget review statements for october december 2021 and the recommendation to report item 1408 is received as information [Music] and a second place mccarthy someone else to second place and discuss i can 't fathom this report especially down the bottom general fund so the cancellation the quarry bits give us the deficit at all okay the correction of the rental income independent living areas from going to fortnight to weekly payments created a deficit of 113.6 and no 131.6 yeah yeah all right and then the fourth dot point to alignment it reads that we had to sell the land industrial and a balanced budget for this quarter so i i just can 't_''_14946.8 fathom that that 's that 's the way that this report should read i 'm a bit i understand that this is not the way figures should be presented so we 'll kick it off first how does changing fortnightly to weekly payments give us a 113 000.6 deficit it 's the same amount of money coming in for the same rental corporate sources director yeah sure through the chair uh councillor that one through the budget review was uh and i guess an era picked up in the uh initial budgeting uh when that budget was done uh the there was a i guess another through this quarterly budget review so the revenue expected uh was double as to what will actually occur so we 've adjusted that through this this budget review process okay and then what about sale of the land surely goodness the sale of the land just goes to the land bank doesn 't it we 've had no expenditure in that quarter or or that year at all haven 't we through something so through the chair what what we indicated that we 're going to recognize in terms of sales through the budget has been exceeded so we 're just indicating that through this budget process to say we 're getting more money than what we expected to get so through the quarterly budget review that is the time and i 'll be corrected if i 'm wrong that you amend that to make sure that you are accurately reporting what you 're getting in and out as part of your operations but you you might have no sales so you should have budget for anything so we have to like if you 're not budgeting to do these budgeted and paid that money out right so it 's through this is income this is coming in so we indicated in the budget we were preparing the draft budget for 21 for 22 20 21 22 that we were going to get 750 000 worth of land size well the fact of the matter is we 've exceeded that so we 're recognizing that through this adjustment we shouldn 't rely on any land sales because it might not happen that 's right and the expenditure would have we would have revised it down if that was the case the expenditure hasn 't happened in the last what five years ten years there 's been no expenditure this is all income this is coming into us i realize that so the quality budget review is the later with money shifted around to make sure it 's a more accurate um document rather than the operational plan which is a forecast back to the budget that was forecast at the start of the financial year and in that particular budget there was an um 750k recognizing revenue in that initial in time based on the continued forecasting 's the end of the fyi um certain amount adjustments have been made uh as picking up uh scenario in the modeling with the independent living units revenue and also the potential for uh increased amount of revenue coming from these particular land sales okay well hadn 't said that we we had a proposal where we dropped the price on some ground and to my knowledge we didn 't sell the ground and we never got a report back about it so why doesn 't that happen so projected income yeah on that ground we 've discounted and the person was to take it over several years and it never happened so we should get a report that that income never happened and hey i think we probably did i don 't think we did well then it must be better or maybe to discuss it completely burying the food on the ground no but it never went ahead the second and third part but we didn 't account for it the projection that we make isn 't on individual sales it and if it 's sold this year you don 't forecast you 're going to sell it next year because it 's gone awesome didn 't sell it and we still never got to report that question but that just means it 's for sale good luck can we move on happy to move on councilman thank you ann um the the performance to budget is say reasonably solid i guess um just in the operating performance ratio um what the benchmark was there what the ipad benchmark we we 're running at around four percent or four point nine nine percent yeah through the chair the benchmark on that is zero so yeah we 've got some work to that 's right so hovering around that zero mark essentially is that you know you are experiencing operations as planned and uh so yeah i 'll read around that that 's the benchmark nd our own source operating revenue ratio which is probably better um we 're 20 off the benchmark there in a negative way we 've got we indicative of because the reason why we are below the of grants not that we 're getting not enough grants we are getting probably too many grants for our operations which is why our own source revenue goes down there yeah sorry all right yeah no we 're hoping we 've got more grants so the week more grants is going to get further down as well well i have to reach that we 're looking [Music] so if i could pledge 120 under the general fund and the adjustments that are listed there under five bullet points there 's a comment at the moment at the bottom that these adjustments were on the surface of 37k in the adopted budget if i add all those up and subtract them i get to a negative 15.6 k that is correct they do come to uh 15.6 however we were in a surplus of 52 after q1 q1 review so when we took the 15.6 off the surplus of 52 that 's how we come back to our 37. okay i understand what you 're saying because i remember reading the 52 etc but i think that probably should have been a therapist surplus without taking it doesn 't have any blame for it anyone else with comments or questions i just wanted some clarification on the independent living units rental that guy had the counsellor currently here where it said it says exactly the correction of independent living units rental income to recognize fortnightly not weekly payments as per the budget model this will create a deficit it wouldn 't matter if it was weekly payments or fortnightly payments it 's still going to add up the same uh it 's true they just put a public counsellor home they they had uh 52 ford nights in a year yes instead of 26. yeah that 's right that 's that 's what it is like forecast 52 fortnight 's occurring a year and only 2016. why the chart with the council was you 'll get x amount of dollars down the bottom and then by 5052. you get this much dollars every two weeks so it was an administration absolutely acknowledged instead of thinking that you 're going to get something that you 're not going to get anyway the forecast so you have to recognize that okay and it 's absolutely noted that it was an error it was the motion all right there 's no urgent business at this stage um local government act 1993 and the local government general regulations of 2005. in the opinion of the general manager of the following business which is the kind as referred to in section 1082 of the act and should be

election is required for the positions of mayor and mayor then it should be held by ordinary ballot um my intention is to run through these one at a time in order to bring amir into the chair as soon as possible so with that in mind um election of the mayor council on the cuban the council and kepney and with that being said i currently have one nomination for me which is a true and accurate nomination are there any others at this point in time if there are no others then i declare that councillor mark kellum is the mayor of overall council for the next two years congratulations um are

massive amount of new infrastructure so well done for the old council i 'll also acknowledge uh the fine leadership and dedication to our community of our former mayor catholic statues and despite her

november 2021 do i have a uh moodle counselor kevin and councilman jackie thank you mr mayor i 'm very pleased to be able to suppose that the foreign to be accepted by the council i know that a number of councils weren 't present for that meeting so yeah it 's really uh i suppose it 's really a matter for those existing councillors to make that judgment uh yes they appear to be a true and accurate recording of the meeting no problem all right uh item zero nine zero one the merrill minute and report the recommendation is the report item zero nine zero one is received as information justin gibbon um um thank you mr i would um just make uh the only observation i would make is about two-thirds down page 11 2nd of december but as a reference to a meeting with mick english who 's the vice president of the captain kate the word graham is spelled incorrectly and as katie is now on the council i should have been corrected g-r-a-h-a-m thank you we must get these things correct i am very happy to uh move that this recommendation be accepted another you add all right and uh putting a recommendation all in favor none against unanimous there are no notice of motions uh counsellor and delegates report the recommendation is this is the oberon arts council the recommendation is that the report item 1101 has received this information so i have a mover and second advice nelson mackerel council graham counselor um thank you madam mr mayor sorry i really slept there maybe a couple of those i 'm sure some of us with the previous council council term will will make that uh on occasion so please don 't uh don 't think once you change sex um look i 'm very happy it was a very active meeting um i i know that one of um our councils who gave apology on that occasion as an active member of the arts council at least and i have you on that on the arts council um i 'm very happy to recommend this report thank you uh there 's no committee reports we have one report for decision which is 1301 which is the over on lga election result many schedule and council committees and i would like to add a fifth recommendation and that is that councillors note requirements for the hit the ground running training and schedule which is attached to the units sorry which is attached to the budget so the recommendation is now in five parts the ordinary meetings of council be held on the third tuesday of each month commencing at 5 pm with the exception of january when no meeting is held council confirm its appointment and chair of the section 355 committees and make appointments to other council committees community committees and working parties for a period of two years council advertised for members of the community to participate as delegates in the section 355 committees that if the council of vacancy occurs in the first 18 months after the election the vacancy will be fulfilled using a count back council 's note requirements for the hit the ground running training and schedule we 'll have a move in a second [Music] [Music] all right please um these recommendations are to a large degree um simple procedural we are the general managers recommended we should move the start climate council meetings from 5 30 5 and that may be discussed uh as we go along um the confirming the appointments of the chair of section 355 committees and appointment of other council committees is a routine process um we will go through each committee in order as they appear in this business paper and uh people who wish to nominate may do so and if there are more nominees than actual places within that committee we will uh we will go to a uh process um we will this has gives us the authority to advertise members of the community to participate as delegates in the section 355 committees and that 's quite important it 's a big part of our community engagement is to have good community members on the 355 committees the fourth one is a new recommendation is due to the change voting processes where if a councillor um sorry council vacancy occurs in the first 18 months there will be a count back of the current election of the december 4th election results uh to fill that vape to rather have a violation which is quite expensive process and the last one which i put in there is simply because we have a section there about council of training and it is important and it is mandatory for parts of our management why is it needed to be included i put it in there for people to know and make people more aware of it um i 'm not sure sorry uh mr mayor i 'm not sure if the second was going to speak first in in favor of that problem i 'll think about it proposed amendment in a minute but i i appreciate the issue about staff times and and the five o 'clock meeting however as a council we also have to be mindful that we we want a broad section of people on the council and people have worked commitments and 530 would suit me personally better um i 'm sure they 're probably some other members who are sitting here who may have a similar view i realize that we have to balance staff time as against councillors availabilities um and infringing on also councillors time as well as well as our staff i would personally like to hear the views of other councillors generally on in particular resolution uh sorry recommendation one um to get a broad sense of what people 's feeling is before i look at proposing or potentially proposing a bit that 's fair enough though so counselors are happy i 'll go around from left to right and get a bit of people 's first council i 'd like to see meetings start around six again that 's the problem um i agree with the earlier start 25 it 's only once a month it 's a commitment to the staff who work here as well and just making ourselves available from time to time to begin with schedule council doctrine i would suggest a start time of about 7 p.m with a meal prior advantages to that um it gives a bit of extra time for people that are either working or living at their way from town to to psy even if they 're not here in time for the start of the 96 it also gives extra time for members of the public who might be working and who want to attend to get home and get changed have me or whatever before coming to the meeting and it also would give time during the meal for either counsellors among themselves or counsellors with staff to have discussions about things that are coming up on the agenda or to ask questions of certain staff so possibly get some of those questions prior to the meeting and also it would give those staff as the general manager pointed out there are um it 's a long day for senior staff but then it was generally and it would provide and they will try to go yeah the times could perhaps be negotiated somewhat that uh you know i 'm happy to either leave an amendment now or see what others say first suggest let 's let 's wait till we hear everyone else in any moment yeah i don 't really mind what time it is but i can see there 's a bit of a move for a later i think maybe one solution for the staff will be started later that day so they don 't have such a long day awesome okay i mean anytime i think just got to get be here and represent the community so it doesn 't worry over time 530 is i 'd have a preference for five students um same reasons as andrew has mentioned our work as well you know i prefer know your preferences um yes mr mayor i i have a preference for 5 30. the issues with the staff uh being here later on a meeting night but uh i think it 's probably easier to work around that than it is to accommodate some of the counselors that are going to travel and have irregular work coming but i 'll be happy with the status quo 5 30. um one of the things that i noticed in our some when we were going through after 10 o 'clock people started making very bad decisions um people got disengaged from the actual process and tired people do not make good decisions i intend to institute breaks during the proceedings at an appropriate time i think two hours of hard concentration at any one time is enough and then you have a short break just to get up and walk around and i 've noticed that quite a number of times that when we 've had that council has come back refreshed and and reinvigorated in to a remarkable degree considering there 's a small break they 've had so i 'm happy to stick with 5 30. but i will institute breaks um and although they won 't be exactly two hours they will be somewhere as close as i can make it to that depending on what the um the gender is giving us um so what what does that come down to at the moment you make it difficult uh mr mayor given the fact that you moved the original the original recommendation um it seems that there p.m there is a number of people that have said 5 30 there 's some that 's in six and one that 's in seven ultimately you have a recommendation that you have put in place if you want to through you and the second to propose a minor amendment to 5 30 rather than looking at an amendment from another councillor that would be up to the mover and the seconder um however at this point in time excuse me you have a recommendation there that has a mover and a seconder um it needs to be debated in that way unless of course you want to do a minor change to that that initial 0.1 and then once that has been made you will then debate that minor amendment and come up with a resolution from there so it 's entirely up to you if you want to go with the original recommendation that you 've made it 's up to cancel them to deliberate on that if you want to make a monument minor amendment based on the conversation that you just had it 's entirely up the second day uh i would go for 5 30 then so given that you both now concur with a minor amendment to that original um you have a new recommendation there that says it 's 5 30. currently now it 's with you mr mayor to facilitate that conversation um that 's the amendment on the on the table uh 5 30. um we 've had a mover in second round i 'd like to speak in favor if i could just i 'd also probably just like to deal with an issue council tucker wrote um i i can see why the suggestions made i actually feel that um a meal and a get-together at the end of the council meeting is quite important um for the fact that we can have some interesting conversations here in the council chamber it 's very important that when we leave this building we are a unified group of councillors and it gives us the opportunity to have a meal maybe a glass of wine together and have a chat and to make it still but we are unified i think of the meeting now some of us don 't have the opportunity always to stay for that um i note that a number of uh councils around us do not do that and have had quite a disparate group of councillors it is very important in us going forward that we are a unified we have a diversity of talents in this in this chamber so i can say we have a lot of strengths we have different competencies but together we have to govern for this community and i think one of the opportunities is once we 've had the council meeting we 've had the discussions we get together we meet and and if it 's like in the religious term break bread together but i think that 's important so i would i that 's why i think it 's important we do have the meal at the end because there can be some tough discussions as you will appreciate in the council chamber of the council meetings but together we want to leave this leave this this chamber as a unified group we 've had you agree with each other obviously on issues um but at the end it 's very important that we leave unified and there 's you know very very important so that 's why i pushed for the meal it 's not actually addressing the 5 30 but it 's an issue that was raised by council tucker i just wanted to address it all right thank you and uh yes noting that the views as we went around the table it 's clear that uh there 's not a lot of point in moving an amendment as i suggested so go ahead with the amendment as all right i 'll put the motion in five parts um all in favor against very nice now the next part of this is the section 355 committees um and we 'll start with the community service committee this is actually a very important committee it drives solutions for a lot of community concerns and it can be a powerhouse of solutions for things such as aged care and patient transport and a variety of other issues and i call the nominees nominate people to councillor what and just so people realize the deputy mayor and mayor can attend any of these meetings as they seek questions yep just wonder if we could get a quick explanation of what a section 355 actually means it 's something else um through the through the section 355 committee is a committee that is delegated a function by council to undertake a certain um a unique service or a new a unique provision that sits part of local government 's wide and the wide range of services it provides the 355 are a a group that make recommendations to council for consideration at a at a formal council meeting um they they are they are unique attributes breaking down what council do normally into that into that function in which councils can have councils that have a an interest in those sections to participate in it 's also another way for them to interact with community because we invite community members to sit on that 355 where they can debate and make recommendations around the terms of reference that they develop [Music] grove public school reserve uh councillor like to nominate for that how many did we need for that one just one or two traditionally we 've only had one mr ben well how about one and also then we 'll be up to each of the individuals happy with that uh i 'll step aside you 'll step aside yep there 's usually two um members of from the general public here really yeah one thing kenny fitzpatrick the fire captain because the green is where the fire station is and the other one was a young community member that has a very grain tweeting all right we 'll be writing to those people inviting them to resubmit their membership congratulations councillor hayden uh the heritage committee currently it 's myself as chair and counselor and [Music] generally have two and an alternate all right so the order of nomination was chancellor mccarthy castle trimbart and the alternative councillor baby over on sports facilities uh you 'll put your hand up counselor jumper yes council mccarthy yeah i 'll put my hand i 'll go back on that [Music] i honestly thought there was more than and why i support more on it is um as you know sometimes they 've come along and haven 't had a quorum so i 'd like the council here to consider that you have councilman kept him herself on i see this uh particular 355 commute becoming more important over the next council over this term of council and i 'm very happy to have uh yourself and five and uh council trimbath and councilman kekney as the altman just through the chair this is council 's opportunity to nominate whoever they want obviously if if you want more than two people the previous is just a guide the previous is just a guide to say how these committees were established and how they work so if council want to nominate more members on those committees it 's entirely up to council to do so i think the importance that this is going to play in this term of council um probably means there 's no reason we shouldn 't have three members on it um because this is going to be as you know crucial to some of committee in a number of areas so um it it very well maybe it may be that one council obviously can 't attend another but rather than have an alternative alternative just for this i 'm not suggesting this across the board but this committee is important for this term is there agreement on that general agreement all right it will be um council mccarthy council chambers and council mckinney now black springs community hall whereas i cancel uh the eyes on there anyone else um i can put myself up as a as an alternative to be there on a cave and if needed i think i 'm usually there councillor haydn is the council representative for the black springs community hall with an alternate of um councillor and i 'll try and get there when they can yes it does need some direction and this is it all right the audit improvement and risk committee um the mayor is automatically a member of that um and the deputy mayor is is well last term that was the mayor and deputy mayor um but there i 'm sure there graham and councillor tucker did you put your hand up as well i did put my hand up you have two and they are normally the mayor and the deputy mayor so you don 't really have to nominate yes um it 's whether the deputy mayor wants to allow another council to sit on it but traditionally it 's american deputy i 'm happy for an alternative [Music] willing to withdraw or willing to be an alternative or willing to talk to something i 'll it 'll be an honestness and and there will be times when two different can 't_''_2668.88 go on we 'll we will sometimes you can go to sleep in those movies all right the finance committee is uh it 's a whole accounting committee uh the finance committee meetings are twice yearly correct that 's correct uh and they are whole of council so they they have the same processes as an ordinary council meeting so everyone is familiar with that and oh and it has the same delegations um so that 's that 's everyone 's on that one uh performance review committee review panel consistent with the office of local government guidelines um and that would be the mayor the deputy mayor a council nominated by council and a councillor nominated by the general manager together with an external facilitator now princely council has had a whole of council performance review process which at times has been unwieldy other times it 's worked but the last one we had i think on the day of the race there was only four councils here we took inputs from all councils who wish to make input and that seemed to work quite satisfactorily councilman i strongly believe that all council all councilman should be part of the performance review committee i 've seen no reason to change it from the previous few years i think it 's works quite well i think everybody 's elected to have their input into it and i think the rate payers should be able to see that the people that they 've elected this is a topic a hot topic during the election and i think that the ratepayers should just be able to see that the people review i 'm not sure if that was a motion but if it was i 'll say well this is this is this is a discussion about the shifter this is a discussion about how [Music] thank you mr mayor i would i would support it uh with the proposal by um council 's mckickley and tucker um and then if it does appear it 's becoming unwieldy that we review the situation as we have the right to do it anytime anyway i i realize that um as you have said sometimes it becomes a bit unworthy but i think that the last few performance reviews have actually worked quite well so i 'm i 'm happy with it and i do believe that as council as we as council mckinney are so aptly put that we have a commitment to our community to ensure that from the management right through that the council is working to invest it can and that 's through the performance review because our communication is through the general manager no that sounds great okay well we 'll go with holocaust uh the traffic includes two council of delegates and an alternative alternate delegate as well as a representative from transport for new south wales and a community delegate who represents the honorable paul too okay thank you um the general manager received an email or sent a couple days ago i i don 't think the information provided there is correct i could stand corrected uh my understanding certainly the way it worked for many years and from what i 've been able to find online i think it 's still the case that it 's not actually a council committee as such it 's it comes under the delegation from roads and transport for the implementation of trade control devices and the membership is one one voting delegate from council one from the police one from rms and the local members representative so traditionally what this council has done is nominate one councillor uh to be the voting delegate and an alternative councillor for any time that the primary councillor is unable to attend so can i ask if the general manager has seen that email i have had in our problems uh that that 's my understanding and if that is the case i would like to nominate myself to be the primary candidate so through the chair first and yes i did receive your email and my email will be out back so i don 't know whether there is an is i 'll say 80 correct the the thing missing in this document is the police representative on the document council has traditionally been able to supply two members and an alternate to our local traffic committee one is the official member who votes but we have been able to have two members it has always been a decision of this council as to how they want to go about supplying those and the council is comfortable going back to one member and that 's fine and having an alternate but the way our local traffic committee has worked there 's been quite a level of support from all agencies including transport to have that second person on and as part of the discussion for matters that relate to local roads in terms of it being a committee of decisions they make recommendations to council to make decisions which is why council has previously and will continue to see it as a function of the whole of council which makes it a council committee which is why we deal with it that way the delegation is under the roads act so it 's an external point that is it a statute is it a statutory committee or not is one that we deal with as a as a council committee on the basis that any recommendations that you make will be determined by the council elect and also which here um we also chaired it 's down as an ultimate in terms of voting um but the reality is that there 's two members here that they both got to say gary just said traditionally has allowed two members of council to sit on this committee the delegation sits as one so council generally would be uniform in how they approach a conversation with with the traffic committee in this instance it would be very it would be very uncommon to have two councillors sit on the traffic committee and uh also bearing in mind that uh regardless of if the the two delegates agree or disagree it comes back to council on any council uh raised concerns at that time [Music] all right the mix stuff we 're happy with that with uh council tucker and mccarthy uh the works committee is next one and the works committee like the finance committee is a whole of council committee so you 're all going to be there and again that 's two meetings other committees and working parties in australia working parties uh mayor 's automatically a member of the working party and any other councillor can nominate excuse me um i asked the general manager do we have any other current councillors who are actually on that committee katie you wonder i 'm just asking because i think if there are good to know for these committees the rationale behind the mayor being an automatic delegate is that the australia day is vastly becoming one of the largest civic events that council runs and as being as it is that the mayor is delegated that that function as any council if they want to sit on that working party to do so and it 's up to cancer to make that decision just want to make a recommendation in this community working parties that 's all yep um i 'd like to see a new party set up it 's a a new working party for the sports complex so i think we need to vote whether we have that as a separate item whether you want the ball of council but i think this sport and complex is so important whether you want it all the council or whatever but i 'd like to see another committee formed that we haven 't used i don 't have an objection to that but maybe we should handle it at the end of the committee i i think like the over on sewer project committee it 's a similar nature we need to have a specific working party for that project i think we i think we need to have a bit more clarity about things like finance and and what is actually possible as soon as we have once we get some clarity on the options that are available that 's when we we can start actually having a reductive working group just to move establishment of working code these are the current ones that we have that we 're moving towards or there is recommendations on our on our status report we require continuation of these um there is nothing to stop council at any time wanting to create a working party it 's not if you don 't put it here you can 't have it maybe a suggestion is a report back to the february meeting whether in open or confidential about how that is progressing and what the what the nature of that is it 's entirely up to council once again but because you don 't establish a working party here does not preclude you establishing one further into the future maybe we could at the end just put a note that it 's intended to form that that is probably where i was going with the with my commentary i think i think it takes a little idea no i agree so the moment council timber anyone else so we need counsellor and i 'll ask the general manager to explain the cemetery headstand maintenance committee who 's what it does and how it does it yeah um thank you mr mayor it 's also a challenge for me to see mr mayor oliver madame um the cemetery headstone maintenance committee has been one which has been established for quite some time there is a budget around that committee and there are two local members who are actively going around all our known uh our our cemeteries both owned and on private land trying to establish who and what they are this is a huge project and the two members contribute their time voluntarily the the committee in itself is one which still requires quite a bit of work to be done in order to finalize the naming of people that aren 't named and trying to find out where things are and they are a very active group in that space um independent living units tenants panel uh the current incumbent sorry the previous incumbent was carson mccarthy um is there 't_''_3584.4 be the two councils i have no questions that 's fine councilman guardian justin jimmy you 're mythologists and i think um in terms of reference which i think was quite good last time this means that issues with the independent living units were raised by these two representatives that the rest of us councillors may not see yeah i think that that uh that should continue as part of the terms of reference the oberon youth council uh we have a youth mayor and deputy mayor and they discuss issues affecting the use of them in the over an lga this current youth council is particularly active and some very very fine young people involved and have actually caused us to spend some money on various things to improve safety in particular areas so they 're they have a good community conscience and i 'd like to have nominations for that uh councillor graham and castle trend bath all right um the common working party was established to develop the master plan for the over in common it consists of all councils at the moment the master plan priorities developed it is proposed to continue the work party however [Music] the general manager recommends a reduced number of counselors so we 'll just discuss that to start with the the commentary is that council has developed their draft plan and we 're working towards implementing sorry counsellors developed their master plan which is now working towards whether whether um all councils need to be on that implementation program is just something for council to consider we 're all working towards a um a standard that we 've we 've endorsed so really now it 's a matter of whether all councils want to continue to be on that or whether a reduced number is a more efficient way of dealing with things it 's in the hands of council man i think all councils should stay on it and if if you 're not interested don 't turn up which is happening at the moment i think one of the reasons why people lose interest is getting that action sorry but i really feel that we 've got to change the action of this um work party and nominated will resolve that no no i mean once council decide an action if you go back through the minutes some of them leaving the last financial year that action needs to change i 'm sorry but you might have disagreed with me gary but uh general manager yeah all right so let 's let 's leave this as the whole of a council working party and people will self-nominate in reality um the lake oberon cyclone walton track was originally set up to investigate how we would do a cyclone walking track around the lake um at the moment it is really between the dam and the golf club with not a lot of prospects for going further than that in the in the short to medium term um as it says here it meets on an hour 's needs basis and i consulted with the previous chair a few days ago and it hasn 't met for about two years through the chair that 's that 's not exactly correct the oven cycle and walkway is a priority which counter laws in the last term indicated that they an alternate tourist [Music] footpath type embellishment to the overall local government area a number of obstacles exist in that space so it is a very slow moving beast and one of those things is undertaking a feasibility study for how in fact all whether there is enough money in all of new south wales to be able to do such a such a thing so look it is one of those things that has been um there 's to be honest there 's been um limited funding for that type of activity to start with there are obstacles within that being that the the differences between who owns the dam and to what level and private landowners and the encumbrances on that which are still yet to be to be worked through uh but the reason why the the committee has not met is purely on the basis that there are a lot of other things that that we are doing which have sought funding or have funding and having that feasibility study unfortunately there 's not too many grant opportunities out there for feasibility studies so it 's a ad hoc basis so the committee is still there the resolution of council to pursue opportunities in this space there is no direct resolution from council to pursue a walking path around the common and the first part is to have a look and that that process is creating some sort of feasibility study as to what is the real cost of something like that should council resolve to do something so that 's where it 's and that 's what 's a working product um traditionally it 's had the mayor and another council that sat on it and it 's entirely up to council whether they want to sit on it or they want to progress it or don 't want to look at it i 'll suggest that until you 've in fact had a better understanding of my two-minute diatribe and what that means that someone sitting on it and we review it at some time in the future would be possibly the best way to do it all right i 'll nominate yourself for that council mr mayor um could the statement of the party to facilitate a path occupied by the common of the golf club at the moment in other words to get the rest of the ground in in the biggest obstacle is is the tenure that the way that the hand was taken up and if you take it up as you see with the heritage rail trail you 'll be required to put fences up which precludes the stock into the water so why don 't we be realistic and see if we just can 't start that walking track or whatever you facilitate down on the golf club reserve first and if it leads to something else in the future maybe yeah but if you don 't set up this working party why not just do the restrict it to the reserve and take the rest of the land out of it for now that without going back through too much is that the the way the working painting established was exactly that way to deal with what you know and what you own at this point in time and then look at staging it but once again have a feasibility study as to how how that would that there would be some encumbrance i 'll keep myself on there and i 'd like my other counsellor and as we get some opportunity to take this forward we will do so could i suggest that if council mccarthy 's got the time maybe he should be on because he knows that when he talked to you know okay i mean hardly ever means but you 've got the concept in your mind what 's achievable from what you 've said so probably all the logical all right um the over on sewer project for the new councillors this has been a long process which got bogged down in some serious bureaucracy in state government which drove us batty we have in the last 12 months made considerable headway once the um bureaucratic issues were resolved it 's important it is key infrastructure in oberon it 's actually more important than the water because water will last a while but if your sewage system breaks down you 're in almost immediate trouble uh it is it 's still working working for more than another uh seven or eight years and so we 're replacing that and hopefully we 'll get to the point where we can start work on it i mean physical work in the first half of next year um previously the working party was councilman kevin uh chas mckechnie councillor mccarthy um and myself um so and we work reasonably well together i 'd like nominations for this particular group i would be because the importance of this project and as it 's had considerable history um and there 's a considerable amount of knowledge to know about the past to get to where we are in the future i 'd certainly in this instance um councils recommended the existing uh subcommittee stand as it is because of that knowledge and because we 're a crucial point really i 'm happy with that i 'd also like anyone else one at least one yeah council attacker yeah that 'd be good yes that 's perfect yeah all right so we uh councilman kevin councillor tucker and the kidney mccarthy and current and the oberon speech escape mcgill uh yes i was on this um the only thing i 'd make at the minute is we have had a report issued to old count the former council and the new councils um i think it 's at this stage preempting the february meeting um it 's very important that as a whole because this is oberon 's future appearance that we are all probably involved in it um at this stage if we then want to go back to a subcommittee of two maybe that 's appropriate but i do think at least in the immediate future uh because of we 're actually going to be changing and and planning the future of the appearance of this town that it is important that we are all involved at this stage so maybe i 'm suggesting the whole council at this stage we want to cut it back to two or three or four i agree but because the report 's now been issued for us to review um with you um it 's a it 's one of those things that i think all the new councils happened um and that best way of doing that is having the whole council there for that police that initial february meeting uh and after that we can decide whether how to make better use of some other people 's time and have a smaller group so just to give some clarity around that in the new year councillors will be involved in a council engagement session with the current draft to get an overview to give the new councils a little bit more understanding on where we 're headed and where we come from so that will give some um additional opportunity for those councils to get up to date on that and just off the record that 's the thing is it is a comprehensive report needs to be read by everyone um i 've already made some notes i 'm sure every council will when we go to that engagement session because it 's i think it 's pre the next meeting yep um we need to have some views and bring your ideas because not everything that sounds necessary correct um um 2223 that 's that it in the wrong place but anyway is this the truth these are the training sessions which ones these are compulsory through the chair counsellors have an obligation to undertake training right there is no compulsory training per se as part of your role as a counsellor you will know you have to continue to provide ongoing professional development in in relation to being a new counselor these are the opportunity for you to self-educate and give those additional points that you require as a counselor so it 's up to you as a counsellor to go down this path um council itself will be also being provided with the number of training opportunities to hit the ground running is uh training um a list of training opportunities for councils who want to in fact progress and provide their cells as well there is no mandatory you must go to this one can i make that induction yes which which is the induction i mean well it 's all induction right but you 'll go through a number of induction processes as part of that like council had one last a councillor how you form yourself how you get through the council meeting what your role is all these types of things if i could just make an observation um one of the areas i have i found particularly hard loud last council term and i still find particularly hard is planning and the local regional strategies planning how it all fits together i would so the saturday and second of april because of what we 're going to be doing in this term is very important but i don 't know if that 's sufficient for us all to get up to speed because i still find it highly confusing very good planning and i 'm sure new councillors are going to find it even more baffling um and confusing so i don 't know i really think we we 're going to have to what we do in that space is going to be very important so through the chair as part of the proposed program of training works a very important date the council should put in their doors is the 27th of january this is when agency that 'll give you the opportunity to go through these things the induction processes that that this facilitator provides for is excellent and it gives an opportunity to not talk to me to talk to an independent about whether what i 'm telling you is correct or what you think is correct so that is a huge opportunity planning is one of those things that is i agree very difficult to get a drafts on and we 'll be concentrating as a council on on a continued um program of of uh professional development in space because of the amount that we 're going to go through in the next three years thank you thank you i feel that this new sporting complex working party should be added to the next box forum at this time in the movie whether you derive who 's going to be on it for the later stage but i don 't want to see it forgotten i don 't know when we 're doing with general business at a normal meet there 's no general business so here you get it really slotted see that added now while we 're dealing with these committees and working days well at the moment it 's a it would be a working party with no terms of reference or structure or that 's right but what i 'm getting at is when you do your general business you get the report from the general manager there is no general business available for the council so this should be slotted in now and i just feel that later on it 's going to be forgotten well i won 't forget it because i 'm going to tell the general manager now that we need to have this brought up at the february meeting with a proposal for the for the scope and structure and term for reference yet forgotten sorry if council mccarthy 's worried we could put boxes there and say terms of reference to the final february 2022 meet that 's exactly what we mean in terms of reference and if there 's a concern and just just for consistency the the way that this complex has been developed is purely under the delegations that have that authority that allows us to extend that i 've got no problem which is why i have no problem with the establishment of a working party [Music] the first uh five parts including the minor amendment to the time the 5 30. um i 'm very happy that we 've agreed on all the relevant meetings section 355 committees and council committees [Music] you already had a mover being yourself and councillor trimbath the first recommendation that you made was in fact to endorse the 5 30 time yes it was moved like it was endorsed by both you have now committed all your councils to the different committees and working parties that we have it hasn 't changed the original motion put forward by the mayor and council trembla it doesn 't need a secondary motion it is purely now a matter for council to endorse all those things together with the uh councillors elected to those committees i apologize i apologize you set this up i don 't know i apologize if there 's any confusion but ultimately um sharon will take me at the back have four people moving a motion and second when you only need to so for the purposes of um appropriateness it would simply be a matter of resolving what the mayor and council of trenbath have recommended in the first instance noting that counselors have endorsement of all the committees and working parties does that make sense so i 'm now just putting the motion you 're putting the motion all in favor because that saves me having a stand up with my executive coordinator now on to 1302 which is delegates to external organizations um the recommendations of council 's council appoint its delegates to external organizations for two [Music] no i think we we don 't need to talk about this we need to now go through and appoint the relevant delegates to the organization okay so so through the chair my understanding is frame is the chair of arts out west given that capacity previously she has acted as not only the chair as an independent but the overall delegate if council want to provide a delegate to that organisation it will not affect friends tenure as friend is a local rate player and purely once again up to council to make that decision on whether they want to have an external delegate in their own right or they wouldn 't want to endorse spring in those two mr mayor could i suggest that as katie graham is an arts oberon but she 's probably the best person to make that decision as to whether we should have another delegate well yeah i think fan does an excellent job but do we need an additional one or not i don 't think there 'd be much point in having okay that 's and that 's a way after the question so delegate remains unchanged um can i just make caveat on that is that we sort of haven 't asked fran whether she wants to be that telling it at this point in time sorry i can confirm that fran has indicated that she 's happy to continue on that thank you management steering committee you 're currently on a council agenda i am on it and i 'm a member of it um there could be the only issue um if there was an alternative there 's the alternative that would you solve that problem because as a primary member i 'm happy to do as an alternative well just just the two you know so and we we can you can attend you 're entitled to attend anyway so we 'll just bring you up and so you 've got to attend sorry man um through the chair just in terms of whether there 's a voting role if you both have a an interest then you need to have a delegate in your committee just so that voting role does not until i suppose there 's some finance until some finance flows from oberon then there would be some need to have a voting delegate on it without vote without any thought i don 't think there 's any money thrown over at the moment there would not be a necessity to do it sure it 's just for information services but i do agree that um yeah it could be difficult we 'd have to look at it at that stage yeah it 's a watch and why because as the name suggests the majority of funding comes from [Music] black springs community association i could be the alternate uh all right so it 'll be chancellor hayden um with an old with an um and this is an important committee because it has been um a little bit i can say this a bit disparate so it 's very important to try and unify this community um and it also goes through to the another committee which we 'll be dealing with which is the black springs fall two committees are overlapped with some degree but it 's very important this community working together uh district community association andrew yeah oh i 'll you don 't have time to attend it 's probably not necessarily 10 all the time um kathy wasn 't able to attend obviously all the time neither was i on some occasion so um it 's just really a question of having someone there uh central west new south wales joint organization uh that 's pretty much mayor and deputy mayor and um that 's just the way joe country mayor 's association is the mayor with the general manager i 'm one of the automatic delegates delegates joint regional planning panel this is where da 's of significance of which may also present a conflict of interest for council done by the joint regional planning panel the panel consists of three expert panelists in planning and two councillors and the last one we had come through here in fact the councils were excluded because it would have we would have personal or we would have had a conflict of interest so it was done by the experts it 's important stuff um it needs the ability to read a lot and and understand all the issues now currently councilor mccarthy is a delegate i 'm i was but i don 't have to see that i can actually do that anymore um so we need two other councillors assuming you 're you want to continue with this council [Music] that 's so new south wales public libraries association authorised elected representative was currently previously done by the mayor and in the in the interim tour i can nominate for that i will i will continue with that uh everyone asks council counselor graham uh opter was councillor cable not a volunteer to be the council 's representative all right councillor hayden and i 'm automatically a member of that as well and the general manager goes at other times um i can sub on that okay [Music] or four people go to that and represent the council 's interests yeah so through the chair it 's just an agreement between the parties that we attend or rotating hostile here as a member of the committee for the council uh council representatives uh at the opt meetings uh the oberon timber complex community consultative committee meetings [Music] i wasn 't particularly good at 10d at these things so if everyone else if anyone else says because they which is not a good day for me so council mckinney has put his hand up anyone else this is what once every quarter does this have any interaction it probably doesn 't_''_5575.28 with the national timber council association noting that the obviously the board representatives would be on those is the yeah so are you nominating jocelyn kevin or i don 't know that i could have really been a good attendee so i think someone else probably should i 'm happy to be happy to put my name down but you know okay through the chair unfortunately unfortunately everything would then fall back onto the mirror if that person doesn 't attend so welcome okay um the o 'connell valley community group that would probably place you in a position of confidence that 's the water and council timber all right uh the rural fire service chipley zone liaison committee uh currently uh council mccarthy and kevin our gain wasn 't a good attendee on this so anyone else i think would be better at 10 days than me because they do have meetings sort of 9 30 in the morning etc so if anyone else can attend would greatly appreciate so i didn 't see that quiet i would suggest some council what might be appropriate julie traveling around all the council areas involved he probably gets a better appreciation of weeds where they exist and the rest all right now kevin and through the chair there is another committee that council sits on that we probably should put in place which is the forestry hub is a committee that was formulated through the federal government and it 's the mayor and the general manager is the delegate to remain sit on that sit on that uh committee as well so just for a little fall from the man of the deputy i think this committee is going to have um well i think council it 's going to have a significant impact on on the on the council area so we need to know what 's happening what 's happening positively and some negatively both so that will melt you in a minute i will now put the recommendation which is the council appoints delegates delegates to the external organizations for the following two years all in favor the recommendation is that the delegations of the general manager be endorsed by council as presented in terms of your function um council look after the strategic operations and general management of the the operations of the council this councils in terms of council providing the general manager of those delegations to do israel for her role all right that 's well i think it 's a very standard way of operating that 's a hard any other observations or questions i 'll put the motion uh all in favor say all right all right uh item 1304 disclosure returns to quotes disposing interest and related parties disclosure recommendation in two parts the council will make the requirement to lodge a return disclosing interests of councillors and designated persons and council note the requirement to lodge a related party 's disclosure for newly elected councillors and secondary um i think mr mayor i this is obviously a requirement of local government act and we need to do it in both these areas i just note for the purposes of the new councillors coming in especially in relation to related party disclosure it is not absolutely clear at all stages what a related part of disclosure is so you need to read that carefully um some people read it as relatives cousins some people read it as a family so and there have been different interpretations um probably from a safety purpose has maybe read it wider but then you know it can cause some issues there as we all know in the parliamentary sphere in both federal and state in particular and in some councils people have been picked up or not having returned uh made the or dispose their interest correctly so you know it has to be done correctly and if during the course of a term you suddenly realize you fail to disclose something it can always be amended and submitted through the show but it is important um so don 't take it lightly and the related party area in particular i found difficult i know a number of other council areas found difficult so um i think the forms that we send out by sharing with major counsellors to fill out so that makes it easy and i think she 's going to send word one so that you can just film that type of information which makes it easier but they do need to be done they don 't need to be time of caution there when when you read um the disclosure of interest and you also read the complications sections of the handbooks they do overlap a little bit and sometimes you can make a disclosure that accidentally gives you a conflict of interest but when you make the disclosure you can add to it and alter it or you can add two interests that you 're disclosing later but you can 't order an existing one the way i read it so once you 've made one disclosure it 's binding not just for the term account this council but the term of the next council on following councils so you you need to be clear it is a bit confusing but just just a way of cautioning and i also understand for reading it that again that uh existing counselors if there 's no change or sorry re-elected counsellors if there 's been no change in their circumstances don 't have fulfilling another discrimination [Music] disclosure about just how far down the the list of relatives you might have to to list even though you 've never met them you know just just where to draw that line is it possible to get any uh further guidance or do we need to review and amend the council policy to make that a bit clearer or how can we make sure we do it correctly without going overboard it 's a bit like conflict of interest um if you 've got relatives who are living in western australia and they 're not likely to have anything to do with council that 's not a disposal if they 're living in baptist and they might be having something to do with council that is a disclosure that 's about as few as we could really make it at this stage so for instance if i could use an example maybe that 's um did you know david getting a given of relevance in minor structure the council occasionally buys trees from scrap trees so i list those as a related party but if i 've got relatives in sydney i haven 't listed them so it 's a bit like councilman california i 'm just using example because that helps to each individual counselor to make that decision which is why there is confusion out there the 27th of january is going to be very important in that because the facilitator will run through what that is and we 'll give you more information on what that is so look i would recommend not filling it in until after the 27th when you 've had that training and give a little bit more comfort around that um at the end of the day it 's up to each individual council law to determine whether they are or are not a related party so you can 't sit there and say oh the general manager told me that i did it it 's up to each individual council to do that this is so really disclosures but the 27th will be very important to ask those questions to get comfort around that for for little councils okay any other questions i 'll put the motion all in favor all right boundary realignment item 1305 boundary realignment and land purchase brian brian road faber the recommendation is in three parts that council provide six nine five four two close brackets as a public road by notice to be published in the new south wales gazette two upon closure of lock ten brackets dp one two six nine five four two close brackets be classified operational land and three council approved to transfer lot ten brackets dp one two six nine five four two close brackets to the owners of lot 20 brackets dp eight six zero four six zero close brackets in consideration of receiving the agreed price of a movement secondary council mckibben and castleman um thank you mr mayor i think um it 's important that the mover and second of this should be from the former council term because the history that goes behind this there is quite a history about it um as you will see from the commentary below um but i 'm on the basis of what 's gone before the commentary history and what we know i 'm very happy to move the recommendation in three parts it 's a good result any other questions for the motion all right 1306 ordered 2021 20 2021 financial 20 21 financial statements on public display for 28 days from the 30th of december 2021. smoother in the second place councilman kevin and the king thank you i respect there 's a question over there but i 'll leave it first these have been through um intense investigation previous council term and they have gone obviously to the auditors for the audit i 'm happy that the audited financial statements give a fair account of the council 's financial situation for 2021. okay um nothing further to add in regards to the motion but i might have some questions from the financial director through the chair this is simply to allow us to place these audited financials on public exhibition as the report indicates our auditors will be coming back in february and councillors can critique that at that point in time should they should they require a question my question was i was just going through the figures so on page three there 's a difference um there 's a difference of eight nine five where it says total cash and equivalence and investments if we add up seven it only comes to two four nine four four and there 's nothing to state whether eight nine five storm all in favor against [Music] unanimous all right village 1307 village fund project allocations but over on recommendation in two parts logon council approved a request from burger district community association to draw down three thousand two hundred dollars from the berger village fund allocation to support works at the barrica hall and two the oberon council approved a request from the black springs community association to draw down fifteen thousand five hundred and seventy dollars from the black springs village fund allocation who support work at the black springs hall right now councilman um i 've got some knowledge of both of these projects first one the barricade district community association unfortunately after a considerable amount of grant funds dependent that hall termites were actually located in nepal and i was present when they were all okay um and the 3 200 was for um the commentary you 'll see in the first paragraph it was polar civil engineers to carry out a structural investigation hall to see was and obviously the next one is the delta force pest control um to put a treatment program in place for the termites so that was right it is rather an urgent need um the hall will also in going forward or the community will have to find funds to actually do the structural repair to the balls to the hall 's floor which includes damage to joists in particular um some of the bearers are okay but most of them are i think okay with the joists so we need to keep that in mind moving ahead how we can help them or assist them in relation to the black springs hall um the black springs hall committee came up with a list of issues moving forward that needed to be undertaken on the hall and the first list was the critical issues which meant that the hall wasn 't really safe enough to be used most of those involved electrical works and the 15 560 is to go to those electrical works including an upgrade of the board which is commented on in the second last paragraph of crucial for those small communities in our villages in as a center and in particular in relation to the black springs wall we 're hopeful that once the works are done we can actually increase the use of that law and i think as a council we should be also promoting the use of these halls by groups whether in oberon or from surrounding areas to use the halls so that we can actually generate a bit of revenue once we 've done all of this so i know that 's an aside but it 's important that we look to the future on those so i am very happy to recommend uh that these funds which are allocated by council uh to these uh village associations each year i think it 's currently five thousand a year and be used for these purposes [Music] thank you thank you for [Music] there when they termites and the damage that 's occurred there and it will be doing much more needed to be upgraded and with black springs yes i 'm quite aware of the electricity that needs to be upgraded to have we get get them in use again i 'll put the recommendation all in favor yeah i want to talk on the black strings anyway let it go all right my apologies um there are no reports information or urgent business there is no closed session or confidential reports so i will close the meeting at 11 55 and the next meeting is at uh on the 15th of february 2022 at 5 30 at the council champions thank you gallery and thank you to councils uh _"

evening the first presentation will be provided by Mark Taylor who is presenting the signage Design Concepts developed following the community consultation so mark are you there this here ya go I can 't see you there not just at the moment I 'm not sure what 's going on there I can see all you guys did you just bear with this two seconds mark right yeah it should be up obviously you 're getting sound for me you can hear me speaking but you have another video for each is that correct that 's correct we can hear you speaking yes yeah well I 'm not sure what 's I haven 't done anything different let me get the troll on Friday and just go into camera separately and see if there it says you see me now no oh well I 'm not sure what 's wrong there I can see all you black screen in the middle is can we assist Lynette I can 't assist from this area because the video is controlled by the individual so perhaps mark if we put your presentation up you could talk to your presentation at this point in time yeah well I 've got a bit of wording need to read out so you can hear me I 'm having to do it that way but we will ask we will ask Sharon to put the presentation up and we 're happy to listen to you thanks mark alright so there 's just a bit of a lead in so as you 'd be aware our business was engaged back in October and November last year to develop a signage design toolkit which is to become the basis of signage refurbishment throughout the LGA the initial designs are for the town and village gateway signs then this is to then flow onto the LGA entry point signs wayfinding signage unity city sign inject cetera the idea being the final design chosen becomes a guideline for any subsequent cottage which any subsequent signage is to presents professionally Oriol LGA August reduced v initial mock-up someone concepts for the exhibition and feedback and consideration was required for the newly adopted over on more than you can imagine logo and how we can implement that within the design the follow of initial concepts were put on public display as part of the community consultation process we 've got the concepts out there through the council website the local paper Council social media and Facebook the optimi teams and database community and village meetings and also Street consultations feedback was received verbally by written letters emails facebook comments and so from that feedback we were able to gain a better understanding of what this community is all add from a project of this nature three main themes or three key points into the service that has been shared with each the the want portrayal areas here a teacher speaks lead at the pioneering cultural and the traditional owners of the land set in point being the use of imagery so sort of coral that visually descriptive the one to be visually descriptive ie to incorporate images of the to each town and village and the third key point was our natural beauty our natural surroundings so being able to utilize natural materials through our landscapes such as the stone and timber local stone was mentioned often in the feedback that we received well after consideration all the feedback this led to the three revised designs appear in genomic and sunroof each of these this one combines elements from the most popular mock concepts three and four in that community feedback received it 's a traditional post and panel thought construction reflecting a pioneering and rule rustic feel that the herd would give the frame contrasts with the heritage cotton panel creating a bill sewing has the town village name is the prominent message and can incorporate the desired information for each area ie the established eight know Aboriginal heritage elevation population cetera tell name to as it goes you guys see there in the mock-up was to be reflect be be is I illegible at night but we also have the option in the top corner do the lettering in size carb or be carb and gold leaf on the actual time balanced self a small tutorial to be added in the semi oval piece at the top this represent a particular facet of each areas heritage culture landscape post framework for this ideally be large gauge horrible beans or the repurposed Ridge timber would be ideal and the old LGA breeding portion to be oxidized steel above it that rustic very nice look and the large over on solid out sort of landscape I guess it would have a low tapered stone wall or shoot behind the installation the lower end closer to the rotor as part of a landscaping the leach signs would have a low circular stone wall edging encompassing the sign and providing a garden bed screen is that my face yeah yeah and if we go to the second heritage option this is obviously the same design but dude utilizing the colors of the adopted branding that was chosen a skewed adds that little splash of color but still holds that hearing feel we go to this one binds elements from the most popular concepts around for obviously the additional community feedback this storytelling theme using graphic elements for each area so on base it 's kind of similar across all sides to keep a little bit of uniformity there that represents the natural beauty of the landscape and we never hear each college or local attractions of ghosts in the body of the soul and also we go over on one we 've got through the caves in the background or a really far wing type picture stalactite somewhat more each each of those graphics represent each of the villages there and it can be altered as needed and town village name is want to be the leading message followed by the sake of the copy original here at each elevation that 's this design and then the imagery is the third component and so the backup each area is characteristics the LGA Brandi could be prominent as per the Oberon someone you have routing from the top yeah or it can be minimized as per the village so and so the dark green power you have the logo small ghost in one of the corners there just a bit on there something along the lines of a slightly larger arch rectangular stone wall there it goes the role in your graphic this would be behind the sign and then maybe shrubbery off to one side to help anchor the structure and this single piece monument type structure its describe what it 's made of it 's made out of a poly polyurethane hard-code ish with an eagle faded coding any insulation and minimal maintenance the other two options I expand and contract we 've done changes in the weather what the natural materials suggested the other other to go to the so that 's basically this was from feedback from the villages in regards to colors obviously check the shade uniform across us all the so on each but we can still keep the same feel but change the colors a little bit to suit each area that 's black springs up seized decide not to long ago though happy with those colors that 's the reason easy on that one Oklahoma vast or the earthy tones over the brown on the green there and are eager with mouskouri 's finishes most popular concert the initial concepts which was number four community feedback on the more favorite elements the design give dimensional structure utilizing natural materials which can be sourced locally stone utilized is local to each area so economy would also be more granite focused on the basalt and that forms the basis the bulk of the stone obvious addition of the repurposed hardwood LG a graphic gives weight very edge aspect this design is very minimalist I guess if you uniform across all villages and towns middle like this is playing on that you believe graphically imagined branding at all keeping that uniform across the signs not trying to differentiate between the towns villages sorry so that you click graphic it 'll become easily identifiable and it ties in with what we 've got and its immense that George a branding yes they televised the new earthy natural tones represent the region 's landscape and it will contrast nicely against it 's normally a generally rain backdrop around II here rustics steel or the rustic rugged steel main copy panel to wrap around the return side of the song message Tim no more the Billy each name obviously to be the main focus of these lines legally graphic compliment minimal landscaping required with this type of sign has met the natural stone a natural materials a nestled nicely into the surrounding scenery natural materials obviously favored all construction budgets going to allow but option as a structure similar to the second option still true to the design but maybe less than the cost if I think all genuine stonework is going to be too large I guess the option for this one basically it 's same design just the panel 's swapped out so that rustic panel becomes the vertical piece with the equally and the rain barrel holds the wording as I 'll see you lies as an alternate for another century and written script to sort of people with that heritage feel I think it works with that design but the one thing against that is it becomes a little bit less legible called the distance no that 's obviously needs to be taken into consideration and I 've just got a closing please screen down and to be not the be-all and end-all they can be manipulated as now eat it in further alterations by simply a direct reflection of the consultation process and the feedback was true from the community concepts one and three I 'll obviously design utilizing those natural materials and structure materials there is the option to recreate those in the same method as concept to still staying true to those designs those designs of each it 's this good lava costume minimize the fabrication timeframe and make the implementation of the signage smoother process Christian 's regarding cost and budget haven 't_''_1136.6 been addressed here at this report and they revised concept chance as the revised concept China still was still in design phase on this the next step if the report is to be endorsed is to set up public exhibition in the Survey Monkey God a collection in system revised concepts you can don 't remove Matthew and we do that on the council website in social media and just in closing before I finish I 'd like to extend a thank you to Council for engaging the local take your questions questions mark if the council 's have them all so yeah I 'll come back in whenever you 're sorted so on if you just like to stay there are there any counselors that have a question for mark or would like a comment counselor McKibben thank you madam mayor mark with the rusted panels they I assume will be epoxy or something so there 's no rust running into the other areas of the design but they 'd be rusted to a certain degree and then why suggestions for those particular but so that is on would be a certain urethane finish like gets to that point then it can 't go any further you 're not gonna have the staining and and whatnot like yeah that was a question to prevent sustaining I 'm assuming epoxy or certain Elliott right thank you Thank You councillor dhoni any good evening good evening mark thanks very much um maybe I 'm not reading it well enough but the upright sections in concept three the verticals with the four season tree display what do they may begin or ideally bridge main but there 's something substantial that sticks at the top of the young stone the stone work so so how would they show that for seasoned leaf pattern on the hardwood though the leaf would be then I guess floating above that so that would be cut out of probably a steal and then powder-coated why probably as you see it there it 's not what it looks like it 's sorry out of that timber wait away from the surface there 's another wires that make sense Thank You Costa Tony any other questions counselors well thank you Mark could we appreciate you coming in and will giving us under these circumstances this presentation and and we 'll be dealing with this issue tonight thank you Mark I 'm sorry my right to go now or do I hang around why don 't you write that and then she 'd like to hang around to see the item number where you become an attending if you like you I could cancel this we are having a second presentation this presentation is provided by the O 'Connell be a10 201 9.6 8.1 do we have the presenter can we unmute Lauren and I Laura hello that was going to work Lauren welcome and we are happy to sit here and listen to your presentation thank you very much you 'll put the presentation can you see it Lauren I can thank you so I just introduced I and learn from up and I 'm the secretary of the O 'Connell Valley community group and considering this is the way that we 're presenting normally we would have done it as a group but as we can not able to I 'm going to so we could move to slide two so just as an introduction we would like to start with drawing your attention to the aims of the overrun local environment plan statement towards 1.2 C D and E to identify protect conserve and enhance overruns natural assets to identify and protect overruns built and cultural heritage assets future generations you allow for the equitable vision of social services and facilities for the community and council should also be attentive to the overall development control plan quality subdivision in the open council area which minimizes adverse impacts to encourage use of innovative design and engineering principles which enhance the physical environment and the social fabric and to optimize a provision of infrastructure services in most efficient and effective manner the open note that one still on that one sorry the ovg Cee believes that the objectives of overrun local environment plan and over on development control plan should be respectfully considered together with councils legal obligations to consider the development under the provisions of clause 4.15 of the environment for planning and assessment act 1979 this Act provides for councils consideration of a significant number of environmental law requirements and statutory obligations which we believe are not all being adequately addressed by the developer go to slide 3 rezoning does not green like development that does not appropriately consider or respond to local impacts constraints and sensitivities this statement of in bottle effect an tp2i limited grossly underestimate the impact of a conglomerate of approximately 10 hectare poverty 's in a 28 lakh development the subdivision noplease neighboring the o 'connell heritage from conservation area classified and in 1978 he was listed on the Heritage Register of the National estate O 'Connell has the only Heritage Conservation Area in over uncounseled local government area and there was overwhelming community response reflecting our amount of public interest slope all the development is an extension of urban creep and unsuitable fragmentation of nor adding much subdivided rural area it has adverse impacts to the social fabric the scene equality and a central peaceful country character of O 'Connell there appears to be no settings note an analysis of key views to the urban conservation area they forget in slide 5 it 's the potential land-use conflicts the assessment fails to adequately consider the potential impacts of the proposal on adjoining and nearby ru one 's own land the objectives of the r5 large LOC residential zone are to minimize conflict between land uses within the zone archive and land uses within adjoining science rural sites this objective has not been addressed by the statement of environmental effects with regard to landfill vegetation coverage and surrounding land uses the council staff report states that buffers will be provided however of conflict Council has not considered for example the impacts of domestic dogs and the provision of adequate boundary fencing and we would like to see this considered from the beginning slide see in truth the environmental planning and assessment Act requires the public interest to be considered when assessing development applications community as a part of the public interest on the basis that the overall objectives of the EP and a act is to provide more public participation in planning process the applicant and council stated that there is no public interest in the proposed development however O 'Connell residents have placed significant public interest in the proposed subdivision its pattern and design there have been overwhelming community response to recent meetings and discussion of the puzzle and reflects a public interest in this application so second the koalas the state environmental planning policy number for koala habitat protection in the report is considered that subject land is not a potential quail habitat no tree removal is proposed and the subdivision boundaries between the lights are well removed and the existing vegetation it 's been identify sting and potential near to is built inside the applicant encounter both state that has no trees to remove in state environmental planning policy set 44 tip 44 has not been replaced by step koala habitat protection 209 and is required to be considered a draw attention to the requirements of the set which state that information have had by suitably qualified and experienced person provided by the applicant to the council demonstrating that the land does not include any trees belong to the feed tree species listed in schedule 2 for the relevant koala management area the pea tree species include yellow box we 're also aware of the subdivision undertaken on mutton Falls Road which required certain protections to replace an existing native vegetation for the protection of potential koala habitat the residents of the connell have evidence of local koala populations and cannot report from a suitably qualified professional Friday this is the endangered species and biodiversity all development must meet requirements of the biodiversity conservation Act of 2016 like my own mapped by diet biodiversity have been identified but not addressed within a statement of environmental effects Council states removed as part of development application regard fencing access and road construction there are no critical habitats identified within the site therefore the development will not trigger any requirement for biodiversity offsets however the clearing of land includes removal of ground cover being any type of herbaceous vegetation and as such the present for the installation of the public road alone it seems the legislated thresholds and if there 's nothing barren and as such consent completely issued by 00 this is regarding the water water all allotments will be served by rainwater and dams only no boards will be sunk as stated in the response to submissions a condition should be applied to ensure that no boss will be allowed in a subject land there are minimal impacts to the two creeks which run through the subdivision development area no roadways or dwelling envelopes are located within close proximity to the creeks the closest road is located approximately 200 metres from Stony Creek the closest dwelling envelope tool Creek is located approximately 100 metres on Alex creep all effluent disposal areas can be located so it 's not to 11 around response a condition should be applied to ensure that no boards will be allowed on the subject land well that 's questionable as water use approvals are administered by watering yourself Wales and how it appreataro professionals parallel collation of council and it 's an unreliable water source for potential down dwellings the cumulative impacts of AWS is required to be considered as well as access to stone Ian Alex creeps and not being considered they 're highly erodible and a very important ecosystem we believe that contamination of potential bores has also not been adequately addressed and can 250 50 meter buffer be maintained around all boys from effluent disposal systems 12 is the rule as aesthetic the objective of the arc I large lot residential zone is to provide residential housing in a rural setting while preserving and minimizing impacts on environmentally sensitive locations and scene equality page 13 we do not believe the key views of the Econo lobanov Conservation Area had been considered but future dwell our buildings have been considered we would ask that consideration will be given to a range of allotment given to the listing flats being retained as a large a lot as this is prime agricultural land and restrictions imposed to prevent further subdivisions it 's greater than 20 hectares it is extremely disappointing to read in the staff report that the state taught the statement that the subdivision will likely be similar to pattern develop development in the Botsford Falls Road locality these two settlements are completely different information topography and most importantly the proximity to the urban conservation area page 14 all residential can have our environmental social and economic cost significantly higher than standard residential development in this line there connell valley community group would like to see camp sicredi to ensure these do not reduce local rural amenity until a DCP is developed we urge Council to encourage the developer to abuse to reduce sympathetic land use controls to ensure the development means the aim and objective councils current planning controls sympathetic line controls side analysis with assessment of topography of the land including reach lines landscape geography slope gradients and erosions areas and review of areas of features of aesthetic ecological historical or scientific appear a prior to release of the subdivision certificate Street layer adding to be provided intersection of a con Plains Road and the two new public roads proposed this lighting used to be designed two cancer 's Technical Services Department satisfaction reason to ensure that street lighting at the two newly proposed intersections is constructed to include for vehicles or pass intersections we go to slide 16 why is street lighting required here whereas all other areas in the community rely on reflective rpms and guideposts can consideration be given to retaining the rural aesthetic and not introducing lighting that is generally used in urban areas there is no other lighting used in this Connell area presently except within the village and we do not understand why this has been included and our question is are there plans to include in future developments requirement for this type of lighting seventeen it 's the Heritage the allotments are not only within the heritage of conservation area and the lots do not contain any heritage items due to the topography of the land the majority of the subdivision area is generally generally Heritage Conservation Area the Coxes road runs through the point mented that is where it crosses the current buildings Bell Road near the corner of bas that road Cox 's Road then runs through the property toward O 'Connor Plains Road Cox 's Road is not a listed heritage argument either state or local level but it is recognized by over on council for its significance Council has committed to supporting efforts for the Great Western walk which seems to follow Cox 's road as a large walking trail would go to the next slide Cox 's Road is connected to the subdivision with approximate three kilometres of the original line of the load line of the road passing through the area it 's not listed under over an LEP 2013 as a heritage item however can some actions acknowledge the heritage significance of Cox 's Road with the public acknowledgement of the heritage significance of Cox 's Road through the installation throughout the open and local government area of interpretive and directional signing marking the original route retaining the O 'Connell section is particularly as it would be the walk commencing from the O 'Connell Heritage Conservation Area and proceeding to Baathists most of the original line of track C traverses inaccessible private farmland over on council is a strong supporter of the Great Western walk which shows 104 sites of significance described in the book of Cox 's Road dreaming and over on local government areas from over as heritage area no consideration has been given to the location of the road or the impact of the development on the Cox 's Road the original route of Cox 's Road is clearly scientists on Beaconsfield Road O 'Connor Plains Road and bloom corrode the area of the subdivision we believe public assets to the road should be retained and preserved for the benefit of present and future generations this is a significant opportunity to secure this land and join to the Great Western walk and the over a conifer Valley community logistics Bay protection as well we would however ask Council to request the applicant to formally identify the locational Road and exclude it from private land ownership is the first time it 's become available from private once included the new subdivision and locked up with private ownership will never be this opportunity of gain it would be a gesture from the applicant to the community and the history of England settlement to join this section of storage the Great Western walk and furthermore Council Street consistent consider listing the entire road of Cox 's Road within its local government area which contains more of Cox 's road than any other lgo over the next slide the O 'Connell cultural landscape is significant as an intact example of continuously functioning rural landscape it has some straight and partial structures the Coxes road was annexed auric staging post and key to European colonization of England New South Wales there is a strong historical association with the hassel family a prominent pioneering family and colonial New South Wales and there 's high significance for its aesthetic values as an intact picturesque pastoral setting and including its historic buildings there 's high potential to yield archaeological information on vernacular building technologies and traditions to the next slide conservation management plans had by city university conservation methods and practices unit and residential subdivisions of ten hectare Lodge which may pose a threat to the existing and historic visual presentation of uninterrupted agricultural fields the subdivision design and councils assessment has failed to address the potential impact of the development of urban area the Connell Valley community group requests that the application be referred to the councillors heritage advisor to review the proposed development would reference to these potential impacts side 21 cos 5.10 five of the overrun local local environment plan states that council will require heritage management document to be prepared and that 's used to access the extent to which the carrying out of the proposed development would affect the heritage significance of the heritage item for heritage conservation area concerned whether land adjoining or is in the vicinity of a heritage item or conservation area the over on LEP requires cancer consider how development Jennifers protects conserves and enhance opens national assets and to identify and protect over lands built and cultural assets for future generation how can Council consider this subdivision without a management plan how can counsel consider the pattern of subdivision in its current form and heritage bank volumes the potential impacts of rural residential development on those values areas of features of aesthetic historical scientific social or other special cultural value areas of natural scenic beauty or importance areas of valuable valued landscape character and any significant views to the loss of the prime agricultural land the subdivision of prime of agricultural land in particular the loosing flats has not been addressed conservation of this potential prime agricultural land should be considered nor has it ever been offered consideration just at fifty five and the potential for contamination which is illegally obliged to do so 24 this is just to talk to the community consultation process the development application the application was notified related to neighboring allotments within a 1 kilometer radius of the development site in addition the application was advertised within the over and review on four separate occasions the application was notified for approximately four weeks in total in which case 26 submissions in total were received but we meant to slide 25 not all the community members within this radius did receive notifications and counsel has advised was advised and one kilometer radius and we know that the urban review was used a number of times but there is a decline in newspapers and the reading of newspapers and we question how is overrun review distributed in the villages and probably would like council 's planning for ongoing communication with this media and how you get this information out to to the respective community not just if I live across the road or one kilometer radius we feel that it probably should be communicated to the wider community 26 the public domain the development will increase the number of residents within the O 'Connell locality by approximately 78 persons the allotment site being at least 10 hectares in size will result in ample on-site recreation opportunities for future residents due to the low density nature of the subdivision a public reserve is not a feasible option within the development the O 'Connell sports ground is identified as a project which is needed within the locality and once this is complete will provide an alternative recreation space they developed the contributions developed to develop of the sports ground in the future to this development as an available public space new public space is a large area but not currently available or developed and we don 't know what the timeframe is to have that sports ground finished and available to the community and we 'd also ask if you look at the contributions for public space like my number one cola is two hundred and thirty four dollars and 37 cents which would be a total one-off I 'm presuming of four thousand four hundred and fifty three dollars and three cents can being contributed to that space that is being linked to the development age 28 now in conclusion Sophia another ansel to be mindful best planning principles environmental law requirements and statutory obligations in its consideration about in science we would particularly ask that consideration be given to the following areas the Coxes road the heritage and the rural ascetic the retention of prime agricultural land and impact to the heritage consideration area due to the proximity of the subdivision and we would like to thank you for your time and thank you for the opportunity to present to happy to take any Chancellor questions I will try it was a great submission any questions counselors at all council mmm I think you met a minute sorry um Lauren the council mckimmon I was just um ultimately I mean what if your group you 've said in one hand you want the Coxes road preserve but on the other hand you 've got obviously some issues with the development so what are you ultimately asking for the council to reviews the development and to get and to ask the owner to donate the three kilometers of Cox 's Road to the community or the council confused though the Cox 's Road currently I think if you look at on blood set that most will be on a boundary line good good we 're not against the development development is just normal progress so that 's why we 're asking for considerations in different areas with regard to the Cox 's Road what we were asking if council because this is like a one-off opportunity to approach the applicant and ask if that corridor could be taken out of the mean having a sign of money gender with the copies doesn 't mean anything if I am doing the Great Western walk or it 's promoted as part of our community I get to one end of the sign and then I have to go where to walk around to find the other end of the track to join up to another walk so really is it 's just to ask if the applicant would consider making that gesture to the community and releasing that land within the subdivision to allow it to be a walk and become part of the Great Western walk Thank You Lauren are there any other questions comments if not thank you on for a very comprehensive presentation will now move on with our meeting thank you thank you very much okay councillors we welcome council McCarthy we 're on page six item seven questions from the public due to the current coab in nineteen pandemic and in accordance with the newly legislated state government requirements the april ordinary council meeting is being undertaken as a virtual meeting conducted using webinar facilities the general manager submitted in writing prior to 1 p.m. on Tuesday the 21st of April 2020 the general manager will read out any questions submitted at this point in time questions will be taken on notice and a response provided within a reasonable time frame members of the public who submit a question to Council are permitted to do so provided the following guidelines are adhered to the person lodging the question must advise of their name and in what capacity they 're acting if the person lodging the question is acting as another person or organization 's agent they must advise counsel if they have their prior consent or authority questions from the public is an opportunity for the community to put forward a question in relation to an issue or put a point of view relating to an issue that may be causing interest or concern due to the time constraints a time frame of 3 minutes to a question is allocated or now ask the general manager is there any questions submitted from the public thank you madam mayor at the time of the opening of questions there were and I propose to read them out one at a time giving an overview on what it relates if that works for all council no matter you could I ask that you speak up a little bit just sound just quite low let me fix that madam mayor hopefully that goes some way to fix it the first submission that the first letter that was received is by Anthony Dana from Anthony Dana town planning he acts as an agent to mr. and mrs. Condon the owners of the land in which report further no one talks to the the letter states that references made to the development application being DEA 10 2019 dot sixty eight dot one to be decided by councils at the council meeting on the 21st of April 2020 we have read through that councils town plans report with respect to the subdivision proposal and are very happy with the recommendation for approval the owners pattern Julie Condon would like this letter to be read out at the council meeting and may provide a history of the Condon family subdivision after a consultancy firm looked at the O 'Connell area for closer settlement slash rezoning into 25 acre blocks without our supplying for it the overrun Council of the day picked part of the property foreclosed a settlement after calling for objections and doing with those over on council had the land resigned the Condon family land is suitable for twenty eight blocks father already had days passed we are requesting four day approval today for the remaining twenty three blocks the twenty three blocks are bounded by the O 'Connell planes and Beaconsfield roads at the same time that the Konkan family were provided the opportunity for the 28 resigned lab was also resigned for Leonard now deceased and des Lee hill previous owners of Belvoir David and Penny McKibben of Stratford Kathy and Michael Biddle of Len betta Norman and Ray Jefferson now both deceased of Riverview Angus and Stuart McKibben today all those that have applied for da is up to this point have been approved the issues rate is relating to the location of building envelopes as a result of the Coxes Road have been addressed and the plan adjusted to ensure noted that a number of issues raised in the submissions should have been dealt with at the planning proposal stage ie when the land was owned to large lot residential the proposal is considered to be acceptable in terms of section 4.15 of the environment planning and assessment act 1979 as amended and potential impacts are expected to be minor with the imposition of standard conditions trusting that the information previously provided will enable council to determine the application by way of approval we don 't believe that there are any planning grounds to refuse the development application and you know sign off to say that we 've you have any questions you can contact the rider so that 's the first submission that has been tabled as part of D of the report though they know well which out that unnoticed Thank You junior manager they the second the second letter has been lodged by him is a need of Rodgers she acts for herself and she makes some observations and and the questions relate to a number of things they talk about council summary at 12.1 D and subdivision is not likely to impact nearby water courses which run through the center of each a lot of the allotment bf1 disposal is proposed well away from the creek build envelopes to be away from the creek how all this be controlled as is clear after the summer of 1920 council slush councils under pressure to keep up with playing for the future water events including the capture and all low rainfall or the sudden excessive rainfall or water quality or the anticipated spoilage of water at low dam levels or the quality over quantity of concern third point is as the total subdivision would permit a minimum of 28 with the potential maximum of 56 being jill occupancies how is council forecasting water used expanding the community draw without directly confronting obligations of supplier needs to be addressed if you and then there 's a quote to councils agenda item being for 907 it says although the overrun region has received scattered rainfall across the region during February and March 2020 Barry little has fallen within the catchment of the Oberon team continues to fall level to water 's a note also that over on dam level is currently at 25.4% as at 17 April twenty twenty fourth point is there an intention to expand dam capacity and a lot of planned expansion of the shire or increased number of dwellings or increase the population of permanent residents the fifth point how is Castle planning future water needs in an expanding community is their digital monitoring of drawdowns will there be fines to prevent water trading or theft runoff spoiling water quality at low level in dem the recent fire events the fire retardant sleek matter dust ash animal disturbance water quality is paramount it will be affected before low quality becomes an issue Pauline F is over on Council in respect of this subdivision concerning any of the following tank rebates compulsory static water supply additional firefighting tanks enforced as a condition cap water access and community pumps once the threshold is reached allocating and all controlling water access to community water okay over on dem and if so how is the cap water used point G at 12 of council summary it 's local environment plan water courses it 's noted that the comments are generalized response and unsupported in fact how are they unlikely impacts measured gauged or supportive New South Wales water controls and licences water extraction from creeks and bores how will the conditional taller restriction on the construction of bores be enforced Council has no a little role to play in this area or is there an attention to enforce the matter of style this next point is what is council 's what is councils clear intention with respect to this issue at H at 13 of councils summary in the DCP of 2001 if firefighting water tanks are not imposed as a condition drawdown will be from Oberon dead how will that be control or overseen next point water tank capacity 10 out 10,000 letters it is too small the following dot point with the cast 's of consider imposing conditions for the tank capacity of not less than 50,000 litres otherwise drawdown of excess required will be from the dam how will counsel police patrol or maintain this plea by at 14 if council summary assessment water how will the role does council play in this regard next dot point deems minimum what sighs compromised water storage by dam sea water New South Wales is requirements and J at the council summary recommendation of conditions Council has recommended recommended nothing in relation to water nothing in relation to dams nothing in relation to firefighting water supply and default the final comment is it 's believed that this is entirely inadequate thank you no manager machine you 'll take that on notice happy to say that owners mother Mary the third the third commentary has come from Philippines who acts for himself and this is a question from the public at today 's council meeting mayor sad Jewett 's regarding your reply to my letter about the manipulated fake SRC poll and my question to dr. Schar t7s Warren and I apologize if I 've pronounced that incorrectly one you did make a commitment to look at the SRC poll and there are a number of people who are in attendance at the meeting who are willing to testify as to what was said just because it was edited from the say you will do something you will do it point to and why would you not want to look into any poll that was obviously not to the truth of the real numbers of residents against fluoridation 3 as to my unanswered questions to dr. Shanthi 7 areas Warren I will repeat what I said before she made a commitment to get back to council with the answer to my question as an Oberon resident and right payer I expect you to follow up and get a reply the fourth point is and I may remind you and all councillors that you 're elected to serve the residents of Oberon in their in their best interests and not the other way around Thank You general major I will respond to that it was addressed to me and I have responded by email on two separate occasions to the questions tabled by mr. Haynes and I have nothing further to add to those responses thank you I 'm the fourth piece of Correspondence come from comes from mr. Harley dry him who acts and the submission or the country states sent on notice I take this on notice madam mayor said on record at the February meeting audio recording number three time stamp zero zero five one in response to councillor McKibben 's pointing out that the inadequacies and failings of Jim Wallace doing with the centium report when willowmere address this issue many items in the past will take it on notice by the mayor and council staff Council and McKibben contributed previously to cap committed contributor previously this council needs a rung sheet recording comments made promises given dates agreed on and issues taken on those so they are not forgotten why does this council not fire this well-established tool of controlling meetings what our council is in what I counsels intentions three called all actions transparently and if yes by when to help them here in the evaluation of the centium report filings and tax dot the attached document shows action items were modified which timelines extended by up to a year and which details were deleted the director changed highlighted items after counselors signed off of previous version without there being any mention in the business papers action item in February it is now on record the Jim almost seems to have approved the changes made by the director with all counselors condoning this manipulative process is this correct I look forward to receiving answers to the above questions thank you thank you I do note that there were 23 pages of dialogue accompanying this question which hadn 't yet been read as an operational issue the general manager I 'm assuming will be taking this on notice the last piece of Correspondence comes from Robin Wiseman who acts for herself and she writes my County Council my question for the night to Council many questions are arising from last month 's questions that have been answered however question six on last night 's questions I believe the first part was answered but not the second part of that question being who is to pay for these LED lights and polls my next question is regarding five June as many councils are questioning the wisdom of putting five G into their areas and she quotes Blue Mountains bar and Bay they are questioning the Federal Minister for being reasonably considered and assessed seeing there are many moratoriums to stop five G from being implemented in their areas due to health concern the question states does count does it what does it take or the processes for Oberon Council to lodge a moratorium on any proposed 5g tower upgrades thank you I believe I can probably answer that the upgrade of the lighting to LEDs included in the 2021 operational plan and is actually budgeted for the upgrades is scheduled for 2021 and result in cost savings for the rate payers of Oberon it will need to be assessed as to where the poles will be replaced will need replacing or not and this will be done in collaboration with the energy supplier or the energy provider when the project scoped and asked for 5g there is currently no plan to upgrade towers to 5g in the Oberon LGA any other questions general manager is all the questions thank you counselors were onto item is on page six confirmation of the minutes the recommendation is that the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on the 17th of March McKibben and a second Thank You councillor Killam any business they 're rising councillors no business of rising I 'll put the recommendation that the meeting the matters of the recommendation be accepted all in favor carry thank you page 7 I some 901 Mara Binet and report the recommendation is there counselors that report item is received as information can I have another place now Saluki banana seconded place how 's the technique councillor McKinnon very busy period and a number of meetings obviously a considerable amount of Correspondence during the period if I could met a mare on page eight two items from the bottom it was an update on this issue about the mount victoria bus service please if she raised with you by David Henderson yes mr.

subdivision recommendation is the council approved development application 1 0 201 9.6 8.1 for the 23 lot 3 why three eight six lot 801 in dp1 131 375 and lot one in DP 1 2 5 6 double 8 being known as 53 o 'connell play Ezreal o 'connell in accordance with section from four point one six of the environmental planning and assessment action 1979 and conditions contained within this report for the following reasons development is permissible within consent within the r5 large rock residential zone described by the local over on local environmental plan 2013 the development meets all controls within the Oberon development control plan 2001 the development will not be unreasonable in regard to its impacts within the context of the existing locality the subdivision will not unreasonably impact the environmental value of the property or surrounding properties and that a division record in accordance with section 375 a of the Local Government Act 1993 will have someone to move that recommendation please councillors Council McKibben and a seconder please council imitate me thank you house on the Kuban um thank you madam mayor and Whitehall council as I 've read through this report for decision in great detail and looked at and looked at the extensive analysis that 's been done by council staff in relation to this completely and I also note that this was approved under the MEP of 2013 and is consistent with the Oberon development control plan of 2001 I think unless I 'm wrong and I would ask the town planner Dillon Finnell or Bruce McDonald or through the through the general manager I believe this is very similar to the situation that arose with the titania development and the when I asked the then our then director Shane Wilson about if we oppose such a such a development application and what would the situation would be and at that stage we were advised that it was highly likely that the applicant would succeed and we would end up in litigation without any he basically without success and that we have obviously large legal fees I 'm assuming that that would be the same in relation to this because I 've looked at what 's already been approved and the LEP of 2013 that 's consistent with the overall development control plan and it 's certain developed and I 'm assuming that counsels basically in the same situation obviously there 's a distinction with the more recent last year I think it was the Belvoir development where it was not part and considered in the LEP but here we have a development application that is compliant with the LEP that the LEP actually committed as the letter I think that was read out by the general manager was saying the the applicant was encouraged to put an application for subdivision they 've already done certain blocks this consists of I think 23 subsequent blocks so in my understanding this should this basically should be the recommendations that should be approved and we have really no option and we should go ahead with that because all the issues that have been raised and that were raised by the community grows the seedling have been fully dealt with by counsel stuff in their analysis and obviously in these submissions put through by the applicants consultants thank you man oh man thank you can be chewed through the general manager is there a response to that I 'm over general manager cannot comment on the previous application as I wasn 't here however I have read through this report extensively I 've been to the site I 've talked with the planner about it I agree with the recommendations I can 't speak for the Land and Environment Court but I believe the other playing directors conclusion they 're very difficult to defend the refusal based on the report my spot is it and discussions with the planners involved Thank You Council on a technique yes madam here I I support the the application and basically I support councilor McKibben 's comments in that we don 't need to put council in a position of litigation that we may possibly not win we need to be very mindful of that the the application leaks of the LEP from 2013 and also complies with our development control plan when you go back through the history of it it it was probably instigated from councils necessity to have some large like residential blocks this is going to make several years and I think there was a survey or a consultancy report for for our five zoning council then went through the process of rezoning it so that these applications and these developments could go ahead and supply the market in the demand for these type of blocks this is stage two of of a of a development stage one is to the northern side of it 's fill road almost adjacent to where these blocks are it 's identical tired subdivision there 's no need for more utilities or services nothing needs to be upgraded there the road network doesn 't need to be upgraded these these services and that make these blocks very attractive commercially and I think we should support the application because as said in history we or the council probably instigated enquiring about availability of these blocks the applicant very well regarded in long long term family in the area one of probably our most astute farming families I 'm fairly confident in saying that they have a very high regard for the land and its intended purposes and you know I think we should support this application it fits and it complies all the way through it 's one of the most thorough applications that come before Horst so I don 't see any reason why it shouldn 't be approved Thank You councillor Callum I mean animate like to support the application and agree with the words spoken by councillor Cuban and McKechnie I went through the details of this application carefully and I only have one particular comment and I think it 's more a typo on the part of the plan but because that requirement for my intent that doesn 't leave us of water isn 't adequate and I think in titania we had a requirement for a hundred thousand litres per dwelling I think that might be the reason that it 's a typographical error rather than a an intellectual one I don 't page 19 counselor and that is about halfway down be 14.1 2.1 the director like to address that thank you madam e the 10000 leader requirement is a requirement under capsules DCP from however when the development applications lodged regarding the structures that go on the site have to require a basic certificate that basic certificate would you any other questions on this one councilors Kelsey McCarthy yes madam L I support the application we went out to the people the people told us they didn 't want small Lots that 's how we come up with these these ten and eleven eighty Lots I see the area of along the Beaconsfield Road with the loosen faxes included and I was just wondering whether the two mover and seconder my consider deleting 32.8 in respect that we don 't have any control over that even if we put that covenant there it 's up to the state government and if you had a ball to supplement some of the agriculture that 's proposed on those Lots I think it is more enhance the urban area rather than hinder for restricting the ball use I understand when this first came in it was Tanya remember those lots are only a little bit over Hector these are lives lots and are just asking the mover in a second would they consider deleting 1330 2.88 and could we get confirmation whether the six Lots would already exist are they under that did you hear the question I 'm not sure I couldn 't answer at this point in time you can 't answer that at this point in time thank you so you 're asking for this to be you 're asking for the report to be amended counselor I 'm asking for the it 's just the quest request I think I 'd like to see you get up because I think this would enhance the grant taking that restriction of the walls off its 32.8 that they can 't have a ball we don 't have control of that that 's by the state government yes I understand that remember the making that you attended where one of the chap said he applied for boar and he got within a week when Connell meetings yep I call that so so looks like the Department of course you don 't have a problem with it well you would have to put up an amendment to that counselor because the report is the report and we 're being asked for it or not imposing sir anyway I was just asking they considered deleting it but I approve the subdivision has been out to the people and the people this is what they come up with the size loss that they want but what about the streetlights can we delete those did general manager wishes to respond this far why of the clarification and things no temerity I 'm counseling McCarthy is requesting that the mover and a seconder consider the removal of the conditioned 32a as part of their recommendation so 32 exists on page 34 it relates to a 88 beams that if proposed to be provided to a to a restriction as to use on the plan of title ultimately Council has no responsibility or no control over bores however it would be a commitment from the developer to fight or restore or certainly to challenge in me any Borgia to be put on should this condition remain in place so I think just by way of clarification and I think council McCarthy is asking whether the mover and ii would would consider having 32a removed from the conditions I 'm happy I 'm happy to be corrected it would still require an amendment councilman Kevin wrote a reply for you thank you madam mayor um I would be willing to have an amendment proposed by councillor McCarthy to remove 32a yes better mayor I 'd be willing to accept that amendment No so can I see the amendment on the screen please so we 've got the amendment counselors counselor Cuban counsel McKechnie are you happy with that amendment I am Madame Ann yes I 'm happy with that better me my counselors is there any other discussion on the amendment I 'm sorry I can 't see the screen now would you call out or you can 't_''_5482.53 you 're muted is there any other comment on the amendment counselor counselor Kellum there it 's in the amendment is removing a restrictive covenant which has been which is in the in its original form is requirement for the developer to provide now that covers both the installation any ground water floors or or the no building or wastewater systems including effluent special areas should be over the potential route of Cox 's Roxas Road now both anything to do with Council it is simply that we have asked them to do that and they 're going to do it and I do not support that amendment I think it shows through 32 a and B should remain as they are Thank You counsel counsel McKibben thank you madam mayor and could I through you madam mayor of the town planner or the direct acting director as to why that comment was proposed or why it was suggested to the developers of that comment be put into the development application I was putting in as a response to the submissions are saved against the Donnellan so as a response to the submissions yeah thank you can i I did matter man thank you I I think the decision as to whether laws are appropriate really is with the state government and the New South Wales Department of water or the name of the appropriate Department is at the moment I don 't really think that council has the knowledge the knowledge that 's required in that area and that 's why the Department of Water has it to make application the Department of Water for a bore licensed and they make the determination based on the evidence that 's provided to them and there can be submissions I don 't think council should be in a position to be saying you cannot have a bore or not that is with the Department of Water so I think therefore we should be sold on the matter and that 's why I agree with counsel of McCarthy it should be removed because well I will just take councillor Helms point that item 32 does include Part B which is no building or on-site water waste system including effluent disposal area shall be placed on the land identified as a potential root of Cox 's road or in the land between the two identified routes so if you take out item B and I can 't see I can 't see the amendment now and bear with us because we 're working this way did it include Part A and Part B 32 just Part A thank you thank you okay councillors we 've got an amendment dad we 've to see anything before we vote on the amendments put your hand up do okay I 'm going to put the recommendation with the amendment all in favor or is that for counselors one two three four Thank You counselors can you raise your hand and keep them still please because the cop or counselor McKibben counsel alone is three four five and myself is six against I am unaware of whether we 're burning for the amendments or the all the entire recommendation we 're voting for the recommendation with the amendments that is the amendment to the recommendation okay so we have six voting for the amendment who is again council council calamy that 's you that 's only seven who hasn 't voted counselors counselors who were voting against this amendment only counselor Killam no madam mayor I was unaware whether we were voting for the omit the amendments or the entire recommendation and that 's why I interject add I 'm as I now understand no it was the entire motion I will vote for it thank you Thank You counselor so we have nine in hands up clearly one two three four five six seven nine thank you the motions carried unanimously that amendment now becomes the motion I will put the motion all in favor carried unanimously general manager you look puzzled just threw the chair madami you only have eight counselors voting not non remember I 'm buddy dounia 's left the room Oh course I 'm sorry I 'm sorry sorry my era so just in terms of clarification the amendment was won seven votes to one and the new amendment becomes the resolution was unanimous right now so thank you that motion is carried s35 item 1302 counselors design refined concepts the recommendation is that council endorsed the refined concepts as part of the second phase of the town signage toolkit that counsel indicated preference from the six presented options and that council placed on public exhibition the preferred designs for community feedback and boating for a period of twenty eight days and I have a move please council McKibben and a second the councillor Kellam Council McKibben thank you madam mayor obviously there 's been extensive consultation on this dishonest here that what I will be held before the kovat closed and of face to face meetings and I also know that mark Tyler has done a lot of work on this so I would I would commend the recommendation I 'm not sure madam mayor how you want to deal with item do you want us to individually vote on the on each of the of the options for that for that segment of the recommendation I don 't we all you know we all got our designs up in front of us counselors in the attachments we need to indicate a preference counselors we all have the I know sorry I know this counselor donees back in the room okay we have a preference okay we will go around the screen counselors so we have a movement and we have a seconder counsel Karen did you want to speak to this before we go around the room if we 're going to put it put something back on public exhibitions 228 days we should give people some choice if we 're going to just pick one I think think we should divide the public exhibition should provide choice for people to look at and I and I think that what Mark has done is really quite interesting and we should put them all up actually and your people that decent look at them custom Cuban be happy of that look like I 'm having that man Amalia and we 're suggesting we put them all back on public exhibition and I 'd actually indicate a preference at this stage that that counselor come soon so we 're what we 're looking at is deleting number two out of that recommendation is that correct counselor column so we should put them all on through if we take number two out that all will go up no I was I was suggesting we put all options one two and three up on public despite okay so we 'll put an amendment there the amendment is that did you get that Sharon just threw the chair Madame mayor if you remove a preference from the in condition 2 or in recommendation yep replace that with all so number 2 would read 6 presented options they council placed on public is it exhibition all designs or community feedback so 2 3 wouldn 't need to have some slight variation at amendment yes could I see that on the screen please Sharon councillors we 're changing the wording of that record or the proposal is to change the wording of that recommendation we have a mover and a seconder of that to either have any objection councillor McKibben no man I 'm just wondering whether we should be at least cutting it down from one two three four five six options two three I just think we 've got to start to narrow this down and if you don 't mind madam arrow might I might make some remarks which in relation to the options which may or may not be supported by others I 'm quite aware of that in relation to revised concept one heritage and revised concept one heritage LGA color option you know I think council at least should make a determination of which of those two should go on public exhibition if we go to revised concept t2 set up a little bit trite but when I go into Baptist they have some signs that have a similarity in shape but I must say I 'm not particularly enamored by them but that 's a personal view I understand so I 'm I 'm not a great supporter of the right concept to but I understand that maybe if we 're going to put them on exhibition that one or other should go on exhibition respector revised concept three I like the first one the natural beauty I think that the for the revised concept three natural beauty heritage script I think that the wording is not going to be seen well enough by cars passing by and that it will be hard to read and I think that Michael actually said it might be illegible so my view is that we should of the six come down to three to go on public exhibition so at least we can narrow in the field of it I think that the variation on the on the on the concept is something that probably should go out to the community actual concept ends up like so I I don 't think it 's beyond our community to have a look at six sixty signs council McKechnie at a mere I 've I think six is too many to go out I live my view would be three and I have a strong preference for the three that I think should go out and I understand that might not be the same as everybody else but I think which put the one on page 59 of the attachments the one on page 63 and the one on page 65 counselor counselors we 've got a different difference of opinion here we need to get this recommendation right can I have the counselors up on the screen please Lynette okay counselors how do you want how do you want to do this tonight can you indicate to me with the show of hands this is the only way I can really do this who would like to see three designs go out that 's four who would like to see the six go out three four is this so what about the just a frame of mind that the mayor coming to the meeting to express a preference as the one we wanted which for me is his concept number three of some shape or form I saw that as the council 's preference but it didn 't mean community feedback could be different from that and that that is how I read it okay counselors we 're not getting very far here castle McCarthy do you have a view yes madam mayor I was wondering whether we can go back to the squares in put down your preferences one two and three so it 's counselor so are we so first we have to decide where the three or six are going out on on on public exhibition this is what 03 ok counselors are we mostly in favor of three counts of Capel did you want to say something Capel yes thank you madam mayor if I may I 'm in favor of putting the six out and I think we 're selling our community short if we start fining them down ourselves we 've got we 've got six let the community decide if we 're going to put it on public display put the whole lot of them up when a community is smart enough to work that out Thank You councillor and I get a show of hands who else is happy for the six to go out so it 's councillor Kellan councillor Gibbons councillor lion that 's a table in Caledonia well I think we 've decided that the whole six will go out so we 'll go back to the recommendation with the refined wording that council endorses the refined concepts as part of the second phase of the town zionist toolkit but council indicate a preference that council sorry Sharon what was the second line number two so I 've got in front of me the council exhibit all six presented options and that council place on public exhibition all designs for community feedback and voting for a period of 28 days so this is the recommendation I had in front of me councillor McEwen and councillor Killam have moved and seconded that and I 'm going to put that recommendation councillors all McCarthy is against the motions carried Thank You counselors we now go to page 37 item 1303 investment policy two-to-one review the recommendation is there that council adopt investment policy two to one can I have a mover place house on a Cuban and a second a place councillor Callum Council McKibben thank you madam mayor I 've read through the policy I do if I could in proposing the in proposing the investment policy and motion counselor are you putting an amendment oh yes what a man okay the amendment the amendment would be and it 's in relation to the council 's order of parties which is on page 39 under three point four the order of priorities is firstly absolutely firstly the preservation of capital which i think is council 's we don 't agree to my concern therefore is that on page 40 which is this is the policy obviously I 'm in the table at the bottom where we look at the ratings and we look at how much the maximum those million can be invested in each of those invest investments that I think and if we look at some of the institutions when we go later in I think it 's 1405 the statement of investments and page 83 we look at a whole lot of the banks we have are not great at a rated less than triple B plus or our triple B plus my concern is in the current economic environment where the world is experienced the covert 19 and it 's causing havoc to the world economy not just Australia and I believe that some of our smaller banks are exposed to businesses that may not survive this economic times and that will cause huge drains on the small banks and could cause some of them major issues that we should be looking in relation to the bottom of page 42 increasing the amounts that are able to be invested in triple a double a and a and I 'm suggesting for triple a it 's 5.5 million double a 's five million a 's 5 min or in fact they could be higher than that because I believe as our investments roll over and I again refer counselors in if I look at 85 currently the Commonwealth Bank Macquarie Bank and National Australia Bank are the only banks that we are invested in that have a better than a triple B+ rating obviously there are two other banks that we can invest in West Bank Banking Corporation and they in said Banking Corporation but in the current economic times I believe we should have at the majority of our investments in our largest best rated banks because some of as I said I am concerned that some of these smaller banks if they have huge business losses and you will recall as of yesterday and today Virgin Australia has gone into administration I believe there 's going to be a lot of other businesses how many business does going into liquidation can some of these smaller banks sustain Obon counsel has previously had an issue broccoli Liebowitz Merrill Lynch when it was and basically went into liquidation I just want to ensure that we stick to our primary primary aim of preserving our capital therefore I think in these times we need to change that mix of maximum our safer banking institutions and I realize that the interest rate may be lower but again preservation of capital is absolutely critical these times Thank You about America thank you Express ask through the chair to all the banks we currently invest with have a government guarantee for deposits of the nature that we have go to the director through the chair yes they do so that in fact makes them quite safe to post safe a safe place to deposit our our investments and the Bigley they might not be as highly rated bank but that rating is not necessarily for turn deposit holders but for other investors many Merrifield cooled through you my staff and I have reviewed this quite extensively today and if I could please make the statement yep so that as some Islamic even has suggested the maximum dollar exposure to each institution is determined by over on council however we believe the new policy is robust enough to guide Council through these strange times as a result of the 2007 decline in the subprime mortgage market in the US and significant losses some councils including oberon by placing more money in higher rated categories which are few it would not be prudent for council to have oil its eggs in the one basket the loss would significantly be significantly high in situations like this one only has to note that a MP who continues to have a strong balance sheet and capital position with its level three eligible capital above minimum regulatory requirements of 2.5 billion at the 31st of December 2019 and yet Espie saw fit to generated council 's new investment policy only deals with instructions that are a de is that is authorized deposit-taking institutions and has the 250,000 K back in regardless of where they are rated or not the non rated institutions that council deals with of which we have three current investments are financially sound and because they are online institutions they produce the best result that being said council limits that dot million the dollar million in this area as a result of being financially prudent and we believe the revised policy should stand Thank You director any other comments on the phone councilors mrs. McCarthy yes was government recommended government recommended that we invest with the post yeah they come unstuck I think to spread out load over these different people is is fine and in the real world what 's happening at the moment I understand that the Commonwealth Bank themselves aren 't lending money to any think because of the kv-4 crisis of the moment but if you go through a broker you can actually get finance from the Commonwealth Inc but anyway I think the policy that the directors given us should be adopted thank you so any other comments counselors at this point in time I 'm going back to account yes it 's they could use coordinator the just with them amendment that the council is proposing we 're looking for a seconder for that do you want to see that on the screen I haven 't yet called for the amendment I think given just went to the explanation out I 'm about to now go back to counselor became and asleep he wants to put the amendment and what that amendment is and before I do that I 'm you very much madam me that there are strange times just for council McCarthy 's benefit the investments that were approved we 're not improved approved by the government they are approved by two major ratings authorities which were private businesses and got it hopelessly and and terribly wrong secondly when we were faced with the losses the professional advice we were given was to cut our money and run and the council wisely said no we 're going to hang in this and and fight all the way through because illegal and actually that is the sale of derivatives to local government so the two bits of professional advice we got at that time were incorrect our own advice with accurate on the basis of that logic I 'm happy to support Adria McKibben 's move to further restrict the holding of those deposits along the lines that he has suggested thank you cuz well okay Council to kick me yes better me I um I I think we should be very conservative with our investments in these times and I 'm not buying these trying to undermine the the Macquarie Bank at A+ and it 's the one that we have the least amount II I think we should be looking to maybe have another look at the higher rated banks Westpac don 't get a mention and they 're probably their rates are not that competitive at the moment but they they have a higher rating than some of the others and I just think we should be conservative in these times it 's very uncertain we nobody knows but in I sympathize with with the finance people and but I also support cancelling the Cubans the proposed amendment Thank You counselor I 'm going back to castle McKibben now to see if he wishes sister what the amendment on what that amendment actually is Thank You Man so the concept would be that we would agree the policy subject to an amendment to the table on page three of the policy which is on page 40 of the business papers the table at the bottom to put into increased in that table long term category from three million so I would suggest six million the double-a other issue and I think the remainder III will asked three minutes the Director Corporate Services would be in relation to those investments would probably be dealt with and I later on in item 1405 but I would be suggesting the concept would be in the current situation we would be investing primarily in thanks rated triple B plus all right sorry rated above triple B plus and with a government guarantee and for investments of triple B plus and with and with the government guarantee we can only invest up to two hundred and fifty thousand so therefore those figures I 've specified for that table may have to slightly increase because I we have five point five for a triple sorry what did I say six million below so your suggest that you ballet would be six million in hey would be 3.5 million and I would be 5 million so I think we currently have what fifteen point five million on in in investments roughly sixteen points yes yeah so and I viewers it currently we would invest in anything above the triple peak but this may anything so I 'm not saying we redeem any investments but as they run all over the concept should we we put everything into anything above triple B plus if it 's triple B plus or below it has to be 250 thousand maximum and the institution has to have the government guarantee of 250 thousand Council I 'm looking for at the actual amendment so it 's not asking for the you talking to it we have to first get a second up so can I see the actual amendment up on the screen please do you ask him am I asking Sharon if she can put the amendment up on the screen so we can all see it is that your amendment councillor McCullen yes I suggested triple a it was six million and I 've changed it slightly to six million as 5.5 million for double-a and five million for eye and then the appellants remain the same at a man yes but it comes from Cuban that is as I said madam an I was asking directions from the director of services as to the other should they director for the director first and then the general manager the director you know yes sorry yes that 's correct and counselor McEwen thank you general manager yeah that 's just waiting for my turn madam mayor through the chair my recognition councillor McKibben did you to put a limitation on triple B plus triple B an unrated to 250,000 I thought that was what you were me you finish the gentlemen a job I 'm just getting clarification about uh me a sonic a bunch I was mad in there but I think the answer from the Director of Corporate Services with those limitations should actually be raised in under 1405 not here is that correct director yes that 's correct so I push on oh those issues being raised under 1405 madam mayor thank you okay counselors I need a second up for this amendment sure I have one place I can 't see the screen do I have a second up counselor Ernie okay counsel McGivern has spoken to his amendment the donee do you wish to speak to the amendment the total allocation there and five top three categories sixteen and a half million is in fact more than we have had any bearing but I 'm happy to support the motion I believe that on the Cuban that 's there are the limitations yes madam mayor basically on the basis that I 'm trying to ensure that we can get all our investments into those top three categories there is a bit of leeway because in six months of 12 months time it 's possible well we could have more slightly more money on I don 't know where we 're going to at the moment but that 's why I provided a little bit of leeway thank you you 're cleared to cast attorney you 're on that response that there the limitations yes just argue any other comments on this amendment councilors okay I 'm going to put the amendment as it is on the screen all in favor [Music] six seven against two the motion is carried the amendments carried it now becomes the motion all in favor of the motion seven against two the motions carried Thank You counselors is a recommendation in two parts counselors that council endorsed the draft version of the Oberon local strategic planning statement and probably exhibit the drafts for a period of 28 days that council for the draft to the department of planning industry and environment for their endorsement can I have someone to move that please counselors counselor Kellam thank you a second of these counselors counselor capable Thank You Chancellor Killam thank you madam mayor I 've spent some significant time in the last few days going through this document and although it is compliant with the requirements levied upon us by government I think it needs small work before we put it on public exhibition that work will not change substantially the content it 'll simply make it a lot clearer to anyone who cares to read the document and mostly the the amendments are about just that clarity and readability by anyone in the in the LGA who cares to Rita at the moment it is a bit hamstrung by planners speak which doesn 't let into great field for clarity so I would suggest an I 've some amendments to the general manager if he would like to have them and we could then get the a more readable version that is documented out for the public thank you so you 're not saying that the document shouldn 't go on public exhibition just that it should go on public exhibition with a few amendments not to the structure of the document just maybe to speak of the document is that am i clear or substantial content thank you sounds like people thank you well yeah I thought it was very comprehensive and a very yes yet forward-looking document which is just what we want but I do agree with councillor Kellerman that it perhaps does need a little bit of polishing up and that could be made a bit easier to read but I think the content of the document is is good it is comprehensive and I think the it certainly shadows the the meeting said that I went to its Thank You counsel any other comments on this one councillors Cardoni thank you madam mayor I read that the timeline is mandated by the 1st of July this year 2020 I 'm just not sure if that online is such a good idea at the moment you met him there no of any ludes to just lengthen that at the moment or are they very keen to drive this through that 's why there is a timeline that the the department is insisting upon we have tried to get an extension on two occasions and have been rejected and this is not only our Council or councils who have been advised they must stick to the timeline so there is no opportunity for us not to adhere to that timeline I 'm afraid councilor McKechnie yes Ben Amir oh um I agree with councilor Kellum that and he 's difficult to read and it 's very much a bureaucratic type document just wondering will the other councillors see councillor killings proposed alterations the Florrick goes on public exhibition through the general manager through the mayor are more than happy to distribute to councils before it goes on exhibition as councilor the deputy mayor has indicated that the amendments relate to some wording and readability before it goes on exhibition I am mindful however of the need to exhibit this in the appropriate way and over the appropriate time period I understand the the Debbie Mary 's has is looking to provide that to me as soon as possible and we rule to get that out in the draft version two councillors for their consideration just by way of clarification we 've in fact approached the state government on three separate occasions now to try and get a deferral of this given the current situation in that response as indicated that that 's nice thank you any other comments on this one counselors before I put the recommendation now I put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 46 item 1305 Mount Bryan and Mount defiance transfer of responsibility are a taste of New South Wales telco authority the recommendation is that Council provide a letter to the RFS for concurrence for the installation of the government radio network and approved to transfer to the New South Wales telco Authority with the following conditions that the New South Wales telco Authority supplies Ryan as I as outlined in their proposal at no cost councils or the New South Wales Rural Fire Service can occupy the site in perpetuity at no cost that the electricity accounts for both communication sites are transferred to the new south wales telco authority on occupation but council is an agreement to transfer Mount Ryan on lot 8506 DP one two zero two zero nine six consisting of a free-standing steel tower RFS shelter and concrete monopole that council is in agreement to transfer Mount defiance on lot 42 DP one zero two five nine two zero consisting of a free-standing steel tower and RFS shelter but council is in agreement to transfer the Lisa for the land of Mount defiance is located to be transferred to New South Wales telco authority or property New South Wales that the New South Wales telco pays all reasonable legal costs for the transfers item to the council delegate to the general manager the authority to sign any required documents to effect the transfer of the vested communication sites and the occupation of the grn on the science or for owner another please councillors council but given the council appearance Thank You Council McKibben Thank You Madame mayor I 'd like to congratulate the general manager and finally bring this issue to an end and there has been a long saga even before the general manager was involved because I the Jeff Ryan had a lot of time over this and I think the result the general manager has achieved and satisfied everyone including New South Wales telco paying legal cost of all the appropriate transfers and RFS getting the petrol license and also the New South Wales Teleco paying for the you h CB repeater on Mount Road so congratulations general manager very well done Thank You councillor castle Gibbons further chair this is a great result yes we 've been wanting some clarity around this for a long time that 's been poor reception out that way and no one knew what was going on we couldn 't seem to mail something down so congratulations in there another great result for the community and those sparsely populated area Thank You councillor any other comments on this one cast was 's just a disappointment that the Rural Fire Service won 't acknowledge that the jury are in follow up that it 's just not good enough I 'm going to put the recommendation our councillors all in favor carried unanimously thank you yes what 's for information councillors page 48 item 1401 monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that the report item is to be received as information can I have someone to move that way please council mckibben in a second a place councillor Gibbons Thank You councillor Kuban thank you thank you madam an extensive report if I could on page 49 under the community harm obviously we 've had the good news of the announcement the three million so does this mean that none of the previously allocated money for the partial upgrade of the hub is now required to be used and that can go back into the town improvement levy or wherever else it came from I can 't recall where it actually was sourced from the gender manager currently the the costing on a QR from a resourcing perspective hasn 't been part of that there is a recognition that council do

process of agreed that we 've lodged with the federal government to try and and try and short shore up that investment um however a draft has been provided to us and we will be looking to try and activate that however given the current circumstances we you didn 't want to need to be pushing that you know you know non-communicative way divider Boulevard do you mean pushing mean pushing it in

through the chair yeah there has been some replacement across the board as you can see in recruitment part F on the next page there are a number of positions that we are looking at going down that path on in our current time where we have restrictions on on the things of I think it 's prevalent to a council to be very aware of a situation so we 're looking to basically slow that transition but we 're looking as part of our reactivation plan to have those positions filled I think the question was where that outdoor staff through the chair across the board Thank You forgiving Central the first maiding the GM water yeah these are water strategic plan anything to report from that through zero domination of the central group or the central J a group now working as a regional collaborative to try and look at our medium and long-term solutions to water security yep the mayor and myself said part of that group in order to push the best possible scenarios for Oberon we 're very practical I 'm currently the long sort of the leaves a long term objectives of the group relate to large scale water storage facilities however those short-term ones are the the the initiatives are they 're trying to get on the back of to enhance our position for permanent water storage and additional water than in our own catchments and I think because this this was a fairly this is a fairly newest group we were setting the parameters and priorities mostly but I when I did the minutes of that meeting I 'm very happy to afford them to you counselor I do I said it 's with you mr. Gibbins yep thank you any other questions all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 59 and item 1402 monthly activity report planning and development the recommendation is there that the report

plans encompass and what are the advantages and disadvantages please I think you through you madam me um well we regard means included putting a dick on to the area where the toilets and change rooms would be so we could put all the internal mechanical equipment there which is an advantage to us in terms of maintenance and longevity of that equipment and also to look at the ceiling and have it a more rustic sort of a and appearance rather than having a low level ceiling having a higher level and that they 've been implemented through some cost is at this point in time so is there a costing change or we don 't know are we still working at the fingers we expect it to be certainly we 're the removal of the false ceiling and going for a full set should be cheaper thank you acting director I think most of the other areas somebody 'll with grants I 'll deal with under the grants but I recommend the report madam an Thank You Givens [Music] sorry Cass sorry cow is there a completion died counselor when you 're talking could you just lift your head because when you look at the computer and Brett it 's breaking up it 's very hard to hear Thank You Lynette castigates could you repeat

Director acting thank you for you madam me and the project is progressing well I 'm still trying to find the contract documents to get the exact date for finishing it is there a six-month project we expected in July or August to be completed so I 've still got to firm up that day thank you to the director Catholic events thank you any other queries and questions on this one councillors please I 've got councillor McCarthy there 's some but just straight I think all the counselors should fight they 're hitting the indoor fitness center and just show see what 's going on as internal frames that have got had to be made where the outside of the she should have been the external walls anyway it wouldn 't hurt to see what 's going on they get in there and have a little it 's just saying still leader have to make premade trains to to a billion that already had an outside skin Thank You counselor now the put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 65 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that the report is received as information can I have someone to move that please counselors counsel McCarthy and a second our counselor on the Kuban Thank You Council McCarthy council McCarthy it 's pretty straightforward murder mayor the report Thank You counsel make you know um thank you madam mayor it 's pleasing to say that the Boyd River bridge replacement is being looked at and the cost is all going to be climbing below under Section 44 that 's hmm third to half way down page 65 there 's also been quite extensive braiding and I notice that any pipes on Jurong Road and particular where Isabella Road been replaced which is excellent news because I it 's been quite a number of people raising those issues about those pipes for some some time I just wondering and top of page 67 if there 's any update on the so long equipment data collection if the analysis been finalized and if we as it come within range an SDP committee thing issue but as it 's here I would just like to ask the general manager I 'm quite happy for the director to give an update you threw the chair at this damage you know the analysis has done what it 's set out to achieve there was some question around organics within the sample and we think that we 've we 've nailed that down to some of the discharge from the water treatment plant as a result of committing to that so we 're getting closer with DPI and satisfying the the total volumes and alike so look it is moving for that 's good news if we have on the singer my stardom on page 67 we heard in the update from RMS I noticed about two months it 's four more since we actually communicated with the moment after this we 're cresting a further review that 's in relation to the road closure portions where to throw through the chair at this stage no I have not had a recline from transport for New South Wales I did send a letter a reply to that as as I did request for a review of their determination thank you halfway down page 68 on the plan and we got advertised we 've gone out to contractors saying expression with expressions of interest through the tube and actually yes getting through the chair we as currently in a position where we 're waiting for the finalization from public works of the amendments that we 've made or forward back to public works to do to finalize that document that will then allow us to send the the documents through to dpi II and also New South Wales health for their review and approval prior to that be no permitted to go out for request for quotation so it 's unlikely that that actually will happen in April it 's probably likely for me look I 'm expecting the the document to be finalized by the end of this week that will then allow me to for that on to those state government departments for their approval it 's still anticipated that we can hopefully get some approval before the end of April that give you a firm date at this stage to be precise okay page 69 the GPS systems required under a chain of responsibility policy where are we up to with that have we actually got some we have we actually attack got a company who 's going to install them yes through the chair we have engaged a company formerly known as pin point which you know Ned Stark they have provided quotation and are already following me the curve at nineteen crisis to be able to appoint their technicians to come beside and commence the installation on the hidden vehicles stage of that ton that work so when do we anticipate that starting and when do we anticipate all vehicles will have it installed at this stage where look we 're aiming for toward the end of this month for that to commence following the availability of the technician given the covert crisis they are or experienced delays like every other business at this point on okay so likely to be two months look I 'm hoping look early May at the latest okay thank you and two-thirds for the council either through you director all through the mural through the general manager have we advised the federal member that we were not successful the tranche one and that we have have supplied for trudge to just to keep the said remember advised no manager here that Andrew we 're about folio we haven 't formally done it but I 'm more than happy to do that I think we I think we should do formerly a that we haven 't been successful what we are applying under tranche to and when it was submitted it just general details I think it 's a good idea to kick them they 'd remember advised on this because he wasn 't he was briefed extensively on the Campbell 's River Road deviation okay that 's all madam may I come in I recommend the report thank you are there any other questions on this on counselors place Casa Cubans yeah just on page of 72 pick up there to the lake we 're going to be doing on the castle right highway just to comment that there 's two months work I 'm going to put the recommendation all in grade on married unanimously thank you at 75 our item 1404 monthly activity report corporate services the recommendation is that the report is received as information but I have a mover place counselors counselor Cuban a second a place McKibben the second done tell us the Killam Thank You councilman keep him going thank you madam an an extensive report from the obviously there 's been a huge impact on you know library attendants and those those things that require face to face but obviously everyone 's been working around it in compliance with the Cova dining restrictions and online experiences of becoming the norm as we 're all aware so I commend the staff in the live in everywhere and working around this this very difficult time I note and page 77 the age of debts that we 've still got quite an extensive title of unpaid installments from installment three this year back through two previous years and I noticed from an email previously that we are seeking to recover a lot of this debt and we have been so we just need to fight on with that through our debt recovery table thank you madam mayor I recommend the report support the word from councilman keeping about the library staff well you 've done a great job and 260 near members in March well over fifty percent of the population of our problems now our members thank you any other comments councillors on this one any questions put the rumination all in favor carried unanimously thank you okay eighty-two item 1405 statement of the investments the recommendation is a report is received as information can I have a mover place Council McKibben a second a place counselors can I have a seconder Kelso Joanie Thank You cousin McKibben thank you very much as I spoke previously I would be unforeseen I I recommend the report but I 'm also recommending some additional points to this recommendation as an amendment I think when would you like me to put that I can explain that but I again you don 't mean to do it now yes please I need we need a seconder before we can start discussion so the recommendation would be and that that investments of the council until the council otherwise determines should be for amounts greater than 250,000 Australian dollars with institution with banks that have one Australian government guarantee semicolon and two S&P long term ratings above triple B plus and pit stop and for investments of up to 250 thousand can be with institutions of triple B plus S&P long-term ratings or below provided they also have an Australian government guarantee that it can slow if you like it as a separate point this policy this this prevent this policy should apply until the council determines otherwise which on which by them is not part of the amendment the otherwise I mean when the covert 19 finishes and the aftershocks from it have dissipated so that we can actually see where the economic situation of Australia and its banks is no surviving right can we see the recommendation please that 's why McKibben is this your is this your well it really is an amendment sorry it keeps flashing about sorry thank you madam mayor and I think this scene should be a it yes that should be three not seeing any yeah thank you and if I could Sharon can be with institutions with an S&P I think I just I know I use the roads in the wrong order it should be with institutions of an SMP long-term rating of BB and plus so just changed the S&P long-term ratings and put it before they are after the oven before the baby plus yeah he said you have amendment yes now I think in to I think what we should do is delete the words until the council otherwise determines because we 've said that in for and in for we should say the policy the policy in two and three should apply until the council determines otherwise two and three so it 's just flicked off the screen I was just reading the last thing if I could matter man that said that this policy in points to answering yes and the below and question mark can be deleted or below question mark can be deleted I 'm sorry ratings of B b-plus or below sorry or below I 'm say it or of a lesser rating or the lesser rating lower rating yeah you happy with that counselor I am better man okay counselors I need a seconder for this amendment do I have one and I can 't see the screen until Sharon 's finished councilman councillor Keller was off he 's waving at me councillor Killam you happy a second them at the amendment I will for discussion purposes only I will provide a different point of view we have just spent some time doing a policy document for investments and now we 're having a second crack at it so the last paragraph would have to be this should be included in the latest investment policy because that 's what we 're doing we 're having a second crack at the previous agenda right before we have this discussion you are seconding this motion this amendment okay so now we 've got a second mover and a seconder for the amendment councillor Kelly you want to speak has the Givens has spoken has the McKibbon spoken would you like to speak to the amendment there 's the the amendment I don 't have a particular problem with what I have a problem with is the fact that we just went through an entire financial policy document and agreed to it and now we 're having a second crack what I can see largely is in fact it simply adds detail to what was said in the previous agenda item on Finance yes thank you the corporate service director like to comment on this through you madam mayor I believe that this is going to make it very difficult for council to have a diversified investment portfolio but that 's all the comment that I 've got thanks Thank You councillor McCarthy understand is what we have in 1405 is a statement of investments that 's that 's like a spreadsheet telling us wherever they use now Andrews putting the control device in this report or or statement which I don 't think believes that I believe it should be there I think it should be in the investment policy if you 're gonna agree with what Andrews trying to do it needs to go back and before us is just a statement of the investments that 's all should be Thank You councillor any other comments on this one councilors going back to councillor McKibben oh sorry care for Danny I didn 't see you councillor Tony thanks very man I was just um remembering an email from Corporate Services Director I was not at the last council meeting but there was one before that noted I think that all of our deposits are institutions that have the 250,000 guarantee was correct through you madam me I believe that is correct I don 't mind councilman McKibben these are extraordinary times how long a transition process madam mayor again through you to the corporate services director could this take I know that 's based on maturity of deposits but I 'm through you many men these could take and to probably February next year it could it could actually take until August 20 21 thank you madam mayor I do appreciate that it 's not an easy thing but I I still support them as an extraordinary measure in an extraordinary time because I do think lost their head about debt incorrectly but they still lost their head and I suspect they will do that again so I 'm quite happy to support Council McKibben 's measures Thank You councillor Capel yeah thank you madam mayor I think the Corporate Services Director in passing said this is going to make it very difficult but we asked her please to enlarge on that statement why what you meant three amanah mean this is going to be difficult because investments under 500,000 are not practical the interest rate is so low that we probably wouldn 't do an investment for two hundred fifty thousand five hundred thousand dollars is our lowest investment that we would go so we would be looking at investing most of our investments in a handful of institutions at this point in time with this restriction placed on us thank you yeah the comments before I go back councillor McEwan Cal Samba Kiran Thank You Madame mayor if a bank does go over under than our maximum exposure over and above the guarantee would be 250 K for those you know institutions that are Director of Corporate Services in response before you will recall madam mayor through you that I did ask the Director of Corporate Services when we were under the other item I didn 't visit this thing and said should I raise this as part of a policy change or should I raise it under 14 point oh five I didn 't ask that question the general manager will recall because he asked the same and I and I the director did say no it should be raised under 1405 so I took direction from the Director of Corporate Services on that thank you any other comments councilors I don 't think there is this is the amendment we probably all forgotten it by now is it going to be helpful with the director if House Counsel McKibben suggests that he raises the limit in his amendment to 500,000 through easier but it will still be restricted to a limited amount of institutions so counselor McKibben do you wish to change that before we put this amendment sorry castle Kimani still muted calcium equivalents are you now unmuted hmm thank you arrow think was councillor Dhoni I would ask his view but I would be prepared to change it to say investments council we fear man 's greater than 500000 we can take the K out because we don 't need that in two because if we 're putting 500,000 in and then say investments of up to five hundred thousand and three can be with institutions S&P long term all that provide they also have an Australian guarantee for the initial for the initial two hundred and fifty thousand for a guarantee for two hundred and fifty thousand yep councillor Kellan I 'm happy with that if I 'm happy with that if my seconder is happy I think oh it 's councillor Kellan sorry support five hundred thousand but I 'll continue to make the point that this should be included in the in the financial policy not in a spreadsheet which is being presented at the end of a month and I think the advice that council mckibben received earlier when we 're doing 1303 may have been erroneous because people weren 't actually aware what the nature 't see a great deal of difference between this amendment and what we actually put in the table at the bottom of page three of 1303 except it puts a few extra numbers it Thank You counselors okay tell general manager just my wife clarification matter where that was the whole reason why I made that statement previously but I think that counsel would be of a mind to include this in the investments policy should they come up with these decisions I think that would fit within that exactly exactly within that table that we otherwise discussed in the previous in the previous some policy 13 so could you just clarify what you 're saying please general manager through the chair I think that through the changing numbers that council is proposed it 's simply in addition to that the table that exists now in the investments policy so it 's just a change and continue to change in that investments policy to limit risk you know the institutions and triple B plus or below so you 're saying that this is already covered in the investment policy as 're going sorry America simply think that these with the additions that counselor the Kidman proposes amends that policy and we should reflect that in thought oh no 5 to say that we replaced these restrictions within the policy at the time they castle could come and you know the Director of Corporate Services can provide a report next month to change the policy it 's just that for this time the way that counsel McKibben is suggesting that we limit the exposure in triple B plus and below and that can only be reflected in the current policy that we have councillor Kellum I 've been getting it this is not an issue of a report this is an issue that is a policy issue and that 's where it resides we can put it we can put a fourth dot point in there and say that this is to be reflected in the fine in in the policy 3 2 1 1 investments and if you replace the current table at the bottom of page 3 of that policy with what McKibben is spoken about that would be as the and not as a recommendation or an emotion that 's hanging in the middle of nowhere okay well another tricky one counselor McKibben could I suggest we 've already changed the table on page three and six we put as I think has been suggested to get over this issue as a fourth bullet point that items two three and four as a fifth point items two three and four be included in policy two to one one at the bottom of 33 at item three point five a four as from today 's date until the council determines otherwise in accordance with point four above will that solve the problem it may solve the problem we have already moved a recommendation on item from 1303 to I 'm assuming you 're procedurally if we can revisit that can I get some advice on that it 's not a third before we 're having an addendum to it for a resolution that you 've passed it relates to the top three categories within the within the table this resolution will relate to the bottom four so you are addition to the policy changes you may eat as part of the third and actually it 's quite permissible to do this procedurally does it does not preclude you doing it because it 's not a secondary resolution glory it is a secondary resolution it 's not a change of an original resolution okay so can we see that up on the screen current Sharon place in the you know in the revised for master contra that Castle make you managers put there well that 's a Karen madam mayor and I 'll take some advice from the corporate services director weather would it require an additional exhibition period should this change be proposed or given that it 's been an exhibition and this is a addition from Council could it be endorsed through the chair it 's my understanding that because we 're actually changing the figures on page three table that in fact it should go back for public exhibition because it 's a substantial change to the investment policy I agree with that it should go back out on public exhibition so my comment madam mayor would within your recommendation indicating an additional period of exhibition okay okay counselors can you all see the so I 've got to move it to the amendment and a seconder to the amendment which is counselor McKibben and counselor Dhoni recommendation you 're both happy with that I 'm sorry that was counselor Killam to the amendment sorry McKibben and I 'm happy with it man ain 't counselor Kalam I 'm happy you are happy with that okay so we can get it back up shout I 'm sorry very difficult working like this I know okay counselors you can all see the amendment there and I 'm going to when I get the screen up I will put the amendment all in favor of the amendment so the amendments carried unanimously the amendment now becomes emotional in favor of the motion motions carried Thank You counselors well was there any other questions we didn 't really get questions on the investment policy from anybody is everybody happy with the investment policy as it is okay we 'll move on to page 86 item 1406 water and sewer plant the report is received as information and I have someone to move that way place because the Givens thank you and a second are councillor Killam Thank You mr. Gibbins detail just interesting if I have it right that the town consumption is virtually equal to the raw water that New South Wales consumes is there 's no other takers from there from the DM is there I just did the figures of a very poor person after eight or so in other words there 's not near as much water going out by other users than when there 's plenty of water in what other uses our own restrictions while they 're on level two I haven 't got a life what information about how much water other users are taking from the dam we don 't get that information yes I don 't get yeah sorry we don 't get 40 years from the power stations we only just get it from more than yourself oh yes sorry yes what you 're saying is there are other users we saw it 's more than yourself files in the killem I hope we get the wet winter that the bureau meds talking about because of the dams looking good at the moment thank you any other comments on this one counselors but there put the recommendation are you for a comment or the recommendation counselor Dhoni I 'm sorry I don 't know what that means Oh me comment thank you I was going to raise it in one of the monthly reports was relation to human resources correctly where I 'm rolling through you to the relevant director we 've lost a lot of external and internal expertise in the water treatment plant in recent times and I noticed there was a appointment correct me to the to the water treatment plant in the human resources I just want how we 're going there what sort of what sort of human resource capital we 've got in water treatment plant at the moment I 'll experience through the chair yes we have a coin today and you start certainly has a technical fabrication background has had some previous experience in some sewer plants but not particularly in the that we 've the right person for the job he 's quite a young fellow with a young family and yes so willingly I think you 'll be a feasibility we 'll pick up quite quick in terms of the training that 's required so yes he is really behind the eight ball but um I think that you know it won 't take too long to get him into a you know capable sort of ability there to be able to take over a little bit more from the supervisor for both warrants or in assisting you thank you but it comes less and nothing else I 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 88 1407 water uses drought assistance the recommendation is there that report be receives as information and I have someone to move that way please tell us McCarthy and councilman click me council McCarthy Thank You councillor McKechnie yes recommended we adopt the report thank you any other comments on this one councillors with the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you Miss 1914 o8 grants monthly update the I have someone to move that way please counsel McEwan and councillor Gibbons thank you how 's the McEwan report I know that there are a number of grant applications pending and a lot of them have been pending under the since September obviously December and I 'm assuming that we 're not certainly with the current financial strains and our respective federal and state governments when we may get when we told whether we 've been successful or not successful is that correct three men the general manager is general manager you know that 's correct counselor however we are starting to see some movement in that space I know the local members to kinda to move in a significant grant to us the the creation I understand that here 's of a mine to try and start to reinvigorate and get some stuff out there so I can only take his point and say let 's hope that they make their mind up very soon because we 're quite keen to see the outcomes I just note that the 300,000 wasn 't a grant as such it was I think you met him in detail it was the 300,000 or the three million we 're talking about I 'm sorry the three million sorry Thank You manager for two and three but it might be also worth approaching our federal members for the federal grant again as I said we we talked earlier about the Campbell 's River rohde deviation and so it might be also worth updating him on the other federal grants were applying for Thank You Madame Ann a stochastic events yes great years to say that about ten million dollars for the Abercrombie rate for the twenty one kilometers very serving very good news and I think it 's a good idea on year page 94 up the top where we get some external project managers to help us get through some of those grant money and the projects that we have to do there because we 've been really bogged down with a real other way really a lot of grants and fairly stressful time for some of the managers and I just think it 's a great step to get an external you have the comments councillors I 'm gonna put the recommendation all in favor carried thank you we 're on page 96 councillors there is no urgent business this evening page

the recommendations in three parts and i will just before we get to that make a minor amendment to the wording of the third part to make it more correct it should read the capital funding to purchase the additional gps telematics and expand the expand into the remaining fleet and be considered in the 2021-2022 operational plan so the principle support for consultation to be undertaken with staff relating to the ongoing rollout of gps telematics to the remaining council works fleet part two council proceed to purchase and install gps iridium to the three graders uh this financial year at a cost of eight thousand three hundred and twenty five dollars which can be funded from the 2021 plant replacement program and part three that the capital funding to purchase the additional gps telematics and expand uh into the remaining fleet be considered in the 2021 2022 operational plan do i have a move and a second uh council mckinney council givens council mckinney yes acting mayor um i support the um the recommendation in base mainly on the safety aspects that it will provide our council as as the comment says it covers a lot of area where there 's black spots for mobile and satellite communication so any anything we can do to make our staff and our operators um and give them the opportunity for us the opportunity to be in contact with them uh at all times is has got to be a major financial years uh is is a good way of um uh limiting the um the cost or spreading the cost over 24 months and i think it 's it 's a good idea to do the three graders and um because they 're the ones that are out in the um in the more remote areas and and in the emergency situation so i support the recommendation thank you council gibbons through the chair i 'm supported the recommendation again on the safety emergency and the location the locality of where they 're working i just also think it might give the greater operators some more responsibility and an ownership of where they are and you know the the way that they can assist the engineer and team and carrying out their works more effectively and efficiently as well and to have that contact with them i think it 's virtually a must in this day and age when they 're fitting into all private industries everything 's heading that way and it 's better for all around so i 'm supportive of it thank you um councilman kevin we mover in the secondary have spoken is anyone else wishes to speak councillor mccarthy can i just have a clarification just to gps meridian does it show up like a dash cam or is it only a tracking device technical services director oh yeah through the chair um it 's a it 's a tracking um device no doubt and it does show up uh certainly locality and a like on um on software uh what my question is does it show if someone cuts in front of the grader or something like that say a car cuts in from the grader um would wouldn 't_''_469.039 we be better off with dash cam if we 're going to protect the staff yeah through the chair it uh it doesn 't have that particular function as in terms of a dash cam uh facility that would definitely be something that you know would be a separate component to this particular software okay um my understanding the dash cam provide a safer thing for these staff and it 's not nowhere near expensive uh through the chair again um certainly you know has the the the tracking in terms of both safety off-road tax credits um it also has the ability uh you know certainly to communicate and relocate machinery as required in terms of maintaining contact with staff so it does i mean certainly sell itself from a data set also in terms of the amount of production you 're getting out of a machine certainly can be gauged for life of assets so they 're the functionality components around the particular gps iridium facility okay my concern was that if someone cuts the greater driver operator off with the truck or something like that it doesn 't show up does it ah through the chair no it doesn 't and i mean none of our other plant have that facility either that 's fine i understand the dash cams aren 't all that expensive that 's all thank you councillor cable thank you mr thank you mr acting mayor just a question um is there any annual running running cost for this equipment and if so how much technical services director thanks mr chairman um yeah good the question the monthly cost which is approximately forty dollars and that 's to be a part of the the mobile or satellite network um so yes that is an ongoing cost it 's not a huge cost though not a huge cost though by the sound effect uh yeah through this year again look at uh you know over a 12-month period now certainly uh you know 480 dollars is not a huge cost by no means per per item to have that uh data which i think is critical to the operations of a of a council business thank you council darling um thank you uh mr mayor um quick question does it um does it default to the mobile network and only go to satellite when there is no reception or um and second question um therefore if we fully lay out this system will that be 40 per month for every vehicle that we have in the um in council asset base general services director two questions uh yeah thanks through the chair um yes certainly the satellite network iridium does default back to the mobile network where it capability certainly from the satellite sense and yes there is a fee associated with um certainly the other gps tracking units not quite as much as 40 dollars but they do come with a monthly servicing fee also to have that collation of data um i think that is between 30 to 40 that fee also but it is per item correct sorry i 've just been advised by the technical services manager the the other uh mobile network devices are around twenty dollars per month uh per year per item of equipment that it 's fitted to thank you anyone else wish to speak or ask questions all right all in favor and against unanimous have we lost um um andrew again have we all right thank you all right next item zero five zero three fixing local roads grant the campbell river road project uh the recommendation is that this report item zero five zero three be received as information may i have a second and a mover in a second to please counselor cable and council gibbons councillor cable thank you thank you thank you mr acting um i 'd like to uh thank the um technical services manager and the technical services director for a most comprehensive report on the um on the job i think it 's um very well laid out and it 's the sort of thing that we 've been uh hoping to see for quite some time so thank you very much for that and uh yes i i 'm happy to move uh that the report be received for information councillor gibbons that 's further chair very good information separates the areas where we need more works and some of the other areas it 's all there be before us and i think they have done very well in explaining section the road so a good start i accept the recommendation council donating thank you um i i keep being stuck with mr mayor thank you mr man um just a question on the last second last paragraph where it notes that the second program of fixing country roads the submission for 1.75 million for realignment of the campbell 's river road is that specifically aimed at the bridge and there a renewal or realignment of the bridge and that 's something we 're still pursuing to marry with this project or am i mistaken in there technical services director oh yeah thanks uh mr chair um the the response to that is still that the second round of the fixing country roads grant submission has not been announced it 's just highlighting the fact that if uh if were to be announced in a timely manner then uh something that you know we would then have to take a a another position in relation to that realignment work which certainly would bring some benefit to not going right down across the existing road alignment as is currently um so at this stage what we 're saying is that whilst it hasn 't been announced our intention is to do it or do the road upgrade works as per the the current alignment of the road across the campbell 's river culvert as it presents currently uh come back to council danny councilman mckibben um thank you acting um mayor i apologize for my uh lateness i had a year 'm still in my work clothes so i do apologize to uh those attendees uh to my attire um i i read this report and i sort of understood that the last work or how we should be scheduling this is that the last work to be done is going to be that section across the campbell 's river in case we get the grant uh you know before we get to that stage is that not correct uh technical services director yeah through the chair certainly it 's a it 's a view that we are of a position that you know look we we can leave that um you know to the last uh part of the work um again we 're hoping that there is some forthcoming information on that second round of the fixing country roads as i i did mention there to the uh to the committee there uh just earlier um so that being the case would bring some benefit no doubt to the to the project um and uh you know we would take that approach we would welcome that approach should that the road um in that section council darning um thank you thank you mr may i just to the layman and i i do not have the engineering or practical knowledge of road building that so many of you have we 're just seeing that uh logical that we should be in discussion with somebody about this um second grant if this major work is to be undertaken on 23 kilometers of associated road um that just seems common sense just seems what we should be doing um those who understand the process better than me can you guide me as to um that this is appropriate that we just wait and see or that we actually pursue this through the chair certainly it 's it 's a process um unfortunately that has been a little bit frustrated um but in the fact that there was an email sent to state government this week actually asking on the position of that announcement so again i haven 't got a reply to that our grants officer did send that email asking that question because that certainly as you quite rightly outline we can do at this stage is take that approach that uh maybe work around that section until such time you know but again once the stabilization starts that is one of the defined sections on the current alignment down into that river should that fixing country roads grant not be successful then you know um we will have to proceed with stabilization on the basis that you know um we 're not going to get this grant thank you uh councilman kevin um thank you mayor then should we in the schedule that is on page 17 or i presume this is a schedule because it does project scope summary should we then be putting row 9 at the end before the total length because i 'm not sure if this is a chronological order in which we 're doing the work as it 's headed scope summary um i 'm assuming that it is and therefore i would believe that i think it 's row nine one two three four five six seven eight or it might be eight which says 8 30 to 9.6 kilometers that should previous discussions that there may be the determination on this grant for the aqueduct over the campbell 's river may take some time through the chair yes you look at certainly the the table is not in a particular chronological order of works approach it 's merely just in a running a running order to give i suppose informative advice about the treatments that will be undertaken again look certainly take your view and the position of yes we probably should have that held over as long as we can to the 11th hour on the project on the basis of this announcement or pending announcement thank you nothing further anyone else council gibbons to the chair uh as the works progress and if it 's a dry summer and efficiencies are there it may well give us some extra money to concentrate on the on the existing crossing if we don 't get any more funds and that crossing can be made a reasonable amount better than what it is now if there 's some funds available from these works as we go as it happens so it certainly be the last on the list anyhow the last four or five hundred meters of you around that area councillor carthan um just a clarification this worked on the end of the arc stone road where it goes to bally row and goes into barrier i believe the um road was the intersection was extended to allow blue doubles to go to bally row and it was not up to scratch to go to barrier will that be addressed in these uh road works i understand it had to be a pipe extended or something to the director of planning uh director of technical services through the chair yeah there was a number of applications made through the fixing local roads program as council 's aware um this being the most well this one being a successful one as the priority application but certainly the intersection of campbell 's river road knocks down road if i 've got this right we would need to certainly treat the road intersection accordingly as you 've mentioned nestle mccarthy so when we finish this road works it 'll be up to scratch to the chair uh look certainly on the basis of or the history of that b-double um permit that was allowed from campbell 's river road through to belly row it 's not probably of my view that uh you know the road is still off of scratch up to scratch to uh you know facilitate i wouldn 't encourage additional movements so say uh and hence why we 've actually put our additional applications in through this particular program um which may be considered you know in future stages of funding but isn 't it already an approved route by um the action taken by bailly rio years ago that they had a truck go out there and the police camera followed and a report come back and it 's a designated route for a b double isn 't it valeria yeah through through the chair my understanding uh yeah it is already a gazetted or approved route for uh trucks to go from the intersection there through to belly rail [Music] but again look you know certainly that 's why we were certainly looking at additional funding sources to a narrow road as as he 's understood and and and the reasoning why we 're we 're fighting to uh uh to do some works on that road should funding permit i i understand that but that 's not my question i 'm saying it will the intersection be left up to scratch to fatilitate v doubles in both directions so will this allow him to go back into barrigan now uh get through the chair certainly we 'll be taking right up that intersection that will allow you know trucks to still maneuver as they are that 's right yes correct okay thank you last question and uh councilman kevin um thank you thank you mayor i 'm sorry i 've got another one so on page 18 we have the three stages of work there in the center of the page in respect to stage one that also i 'm assuming is the work which is the initial um stabilization scope which is on page 17 in that tabular form am i correct technical services director uh yeah that 's correct and and certainly as i indicated should that be the case about fixing country roads so we would leave that to the 11th hour as i indicated but should we actually hold off on the stabilization of that camel 's river crossing further up after stage two or in fact up and after stage three how long do you think it 's going to take for a determination to be made on this on our aqueduct proposal uh through the chair they 're saying that the the announcement is um imminent so what that means i said i haven 't got a definite date of when that 's going to occur but uh it may be the position again and if we haven 't got nothing uh in the next week or two that uh yes we changed the the order there in terms of uh doing the reshaping and and a lot and additional payment works and set the stabilization back um in a different order so well you could do you could yes just not do the stabilization that it but if we are unsuccessful in this current round for the aqueduct i understand in under another one of the rounds of grants under this for the aqueduct does it uh yeah certainly there are other grant applications that may lend themselves to uh the criteria of a realignment to support you know heavy vehicle movement along the campbell 's road road again it is of a the actual campbell 's river at crossing itself is of a very poor nature as it currently is so i think the do nothing is really not an option again it 's still costing council funding in terms of maintenance and ongoing maintenance to to facilitate that road uh for those vehicles so uh again look up we we 're we 're hoping that an announcement is going to be due very shortly and the next uh meeting honors councilman kevin um i think we 've had a good good crack at this one and i 'm going to put the motion those in favor against unanimous all right uh item0504 on page 19 capital works program progress update the recommendation is the report item zero five zero four be received as information i can have a mckibben council dhoni um thank you mr mayor um my compliments on these last two items really there 's a huge amount of work and uh again from my uneducated stance my compliments to those carrying this out this is uh fairly rigorous one small local issue i noticed um possibly because it 's too small i couldn 't find the uh o 'connell footpath uh anywhere does that mean it 's um just a minor piece of work that 's i think it 's on track to go pretty soon anyway and therefore is outside the ambit of this or has it just fallen off political services director uh through the chair yes certainly i take your point um you know i haven 't it 's not on there unfortunately but certainly hasn 't fell off the radar if that um i i didn 't feel that was the case and in fact thank you um mr mayor i support the report and councilman kevin uh thank you mayor um here 's the gantt chart uh on page 21 and 22 and 23 is of assistance to indicate the and there 's a major improvement um however if we go to the sewer treatment plant on page 23 um that just seems to have a never ending date because it goes first july 21st july 21 it has a reference to hunter h2o without any sub subsections under the gantt chart showing for each element which h2o is and i would have thought for a project of this significance we should have that and any other contractors on that project uh yeah because there are a number of disciplines involved with the sewer treatment plant um and obviously some of them are dependent on approvals yeah yeah through the chair certainly uh take your point very hard to represent on this inclusive work scope it does have an independent timeline as you 're aware except being a separate committee so uh you know again being ongoing is sort of representational that this uh is in progress more so than anything um other than the uh the syria treatment plant uh committee that works party that runs that particular project so that as i say again has a separate timeline only the other other section is the town improvement program item 19 page 21 sort of goes from first of july 20 to 30 to june 21 um so i know some things above go to first of july 21 so maybe a day 's difference there um and then seems to have a blue line behind the gray line the blue line the blue bar i 'm assuming is capturing all the activities under the town improvement levy and the gray line just seems to indicate that it 's basically perpetually funded is it uh through the chair i you know i see what you 're saying in the print i 'm not quite sure why the blue line is actually printed in under that but that 's the the gray line is the overarching for all projects under that particular town improvement program and the uh the smaller blue individual lines are the particular project timelines for when those activities are going to actually occur but again i do take your point as i say i 'm not quite sure when that 's pdf 'd uh across from just ignore that lining under that gray line at the minute it 's not assigned and on page 20 we have uh safer roads program uh do we have any idea when we 're likely to know the result of this uh application uh through the chair that 's just been put in uh this month uh for the next round of the safer roads uh program um as indicated on the edith road uh there has been a notable crash cluster which has allowed council through a analysis there to put an application in so again there is uh no defined um announcement time but again that wouldn 't be until next financial year again this will be announced this financial year but the the work wouldn 't be if we 're successful wouldn 't be until uh undertaken until next financial year so it 's just indicating again that we have put another application in through safer roads program this year we have funding under that particular program to do work on abercrombie road which is you know 1.9 million dollars worth of work in this financial year 300 next financial year to to carry on with that work in abercrombie on the abercrombie road so with any luck we 'll certainly get another application up which will allow us to do work on edith road as as part of safety improvements um thank you mr acting mayor i uh second the recommendation that this report be received as information thank you anyone else uh wish to speak council mccarthy um just a clarification the ginken road number three in in the um program is that going to be sealed that road works for 1.3 kilometers to the director yep sorry just unmuting uh yeah through the chair certainly last month after year we did a reseal on the last one kilometer of work that needed uh bringing back up to condition acceptable condition this is this work here talks to an extension of bitumen seal on the next 1.3 kilometers up to keith armstrong road intersection four or 1.3 kilometers so it 's an addition uh to the bitumen seal network so thank you that 's what i asked um the other one is um 18 on starting on the lowest mount road this is the special rate variation money isn 't it uh yet through the chair this funding here has been combined uh with special rate variation money or form of special rate variation money uh and raised recovery money but the section that we 're looking at at the minute because there 's another application in with the government under the table lands way project uh albeit uh given this is one of the eight priority roads where we 're throwing money or putting putting money towards the lowes mount road section from the 100 kilometer zone the end of the substation heading out towards brothers bridge road so getting one kilometer of rehabilitation to the pavement there okay thank you um and the other one was in the safer country roads weren 't we i 'm going to extend the road in between butter factory lane and back towards adeburn weren 't we widening that section of road didn 't_''_2191.599 we get funding for that uh yeah through the chair certainly the rep the transport for new south wales repair program the submission for two kilometers of upgrading between titania road uh to butterfield uh to butterfactory lane so yes there 's eight hundred thousand dollars of work will be undertaken there over that two kilometer section which is a 50 50 uh funded project and where is it scheduled in on uh we have that [Music] line item number four number four it 's got repair and brackets so okay it 's scheduled uh it 's scheduled for the end of this month and hopefully it can be completed by uh by november this year okay thank you uh council gibbons you say the chair i 'm forever the optimist just making some comments um i 'm hoping that on the carl wood road with whether a bit reasonable we can get more than uh 2k is done for 380 000. uh again the road out at ginken is very strong and solid road again there there might be room that we can get a bit more done because we just looked at the eta throughout this you know we 're costing that at four hundred thousand dollars a kilometer and we a bit over two hundred thousand dollars a kilometer so you know i i think we 've got to try and aim to get a bit more done or save some money somewhere with efficiencies but uh yeah the balance just doesn 't quite seem right to me but at the end of the day when these jobs are done we 'll have a look how they went but just comments on that thank you well anyone else all right i put the motion all in favor against were you against andrew all right unanimous uh mr chairman mr acting chairman yep um in respect to the next matter 505 as if there wasn 't an attendance at the time the meeting was called um i believe that i could have a non-pecuniary interest here because it 's a recommendation that a relative may receive remuneration from over on council for purchase activities and under the accounting standard which i 've quoted to uh director of community services before it can be taken that a cousin is sufficiently um connected um i can 't remember the standard i know that one but i i have read a case where it was directed the cousin is sufficiently uh connected so you 're declaring a uh less than significant pecuniary or well i don 't receive any money out of it but my cousin does okay or could do so i 'm not sure how you handle that but i do know under the accounting standard that it has there has been a case where a cousin has been deemed to be sufficiently connected to a counsellor i did read it yeah okay i thank you for making that disclosure uh councilman kevin and we 'll record that as a uh pecuniary interest then so would you like me to remove myself from the meeting uh on for this item um you could go make yourself a cup of coffee how old i know when it comes back on uh we 'll we 'll can we call you well in that case as long as you take no part in the meeting i 'm happy for you to remain right all right so item0505 the warrigo lane beautification project the recommendation uh utilize twenty thousand dollars from the section 7.11 contributions for open space and complete the warago lane project uh can i have a mover and a second to please moveo uh brenda council line and councillor dhoni council line uh this will be good to uh complete this project um one thing that i would mention there 's nothing in here that says that we could put in something that the owners could water the trees um we 've had some very hot summers mcconnell 's a lot hotter than oberon if we 're planting the trees we 're spending this much money on trees i think we need to put in some pipes beside each tree that has leakage holes at the bottom of the pipes so that the trees can be watered in the root zone if we water from the top we encourage roots to come to the top and if it gets too hot and dry they 'll die um i think the choice of the trident maples and the crabapples will be lovely along that lane um castle have you got anything more to say doni uh thank you i 'll go with mr chair i can 't call you quite acting yes it will be uh wonderful to see the uh spring blossoms and the autumn color and it 's um it 's very good this has come about uh it has been a bit of a dog 's dinner to achieve i note that the original impetus came from a local community group down there i note the general manager 's comments that this proposal should be supported as it can be used an example of what other developers will require to do across the lga that would be absolutely wonderful we just need to tidy up a couple of things such as the developer isn 't doing it the council 's doing it and we 're paying for it and in the concept of user pays um since the developer got the money for selling the blocks the developer should be providing the money for the trees which may explain the particularly helpful uh attitude of uh some of the parties involved so council needs to actually make sure that the costs ratepayers unless we choose to do so um because there are no residents how can a developer put in a tree plan if they 're going to charge the residents if there 's no residence until it 's sold and also whilst i think resident involvement is excellent i think we also look for a bit of council planning in the long run as to the the treescape that we we choose to extend across the uh the council area so i think we could fine-tune a couple of things but um it 's going to look absolutely beautiful thank you check mr chair thank you council think anyone else wish to speak sorry mr just in terms of clarification the intention of that footnote from me is absolutely for each developer in the future to know what is expected as part of a structuring plan when asked for that was the intention of the the um commentary in the report not that we would do it not that we would pay for it it 's the example of what we would expect just wanted to clarify thank you mr three time ripper due to eric 's with expectations that this will be done by the developer can 't we hire a three-time river for this project and then we shouldn 't have to use it in the future in respect that um yeah it should be done by the developer and we will have no need for the ripper hasn 't some of our staff got one that they could hire us um through the chair the reason for the the ripper in this instance is um staff have indicated a given council 's appetite for um additional ongoing tree planting across the lga this type of apparatus will not only be used for this development but a a really good addition to our um parks and gardens plants for ongoing and future future um uses which is the reason why it 's been provided for in this report if council proposed not to incorporate that into the into the recommendation i suggest that uh they could do so at their at their recommendation my suggestion is that we just hire one for for now because we don 't anyway i 'm only one that through the chair there is enough to cover for this this purchase no that 's not what i said i said we don 't know how many more projects we can fund under this section 1-1 in other words how much more money is out there for trees that was all right through the chair this this will be used for other things than just this fun the the we have beautification monies that we have we have a number of things we have um tree planting in our road reserves that the the staff are of the opinion that this would be a very um uh good item to have as part of that that 's that 's why it was included i 'm happy to take counsellor 's recommendation in this regard counselor doni sorry councillor cable thank you thank you thank you mr acting mayor um councillor dhoni uh as she was moving the motion um made reference to the fact that we had discussed um the uh some uh watering systems or the need there of um is is has system of any kind on it and if not i think we probably should make make room for a watering system through through the chair this this um development has been escaped by our staff in the preparation of putting this into play uh and more than happy to take it on notice but i would suspect that as part of that development they would be looking at something like that um the beauty of this development as it sits right now is that it 's the the buy-in from the group in warrego lane has been has been very supportive as well as constructive and they 've also congratulated council for taking this approach whereby they 've got some buy-in to what they want to do so the reason why we did this is that we buy into what they want i 'm hoping that they buy into what we 're trying to achieve down there and they take some ownership themselves in trying to water and keep keep an eye and some awareness on this um i 'd hope that that would be the case um we still survive but i i would hope that as part of doing in this process that the residents would take some sort of ownership over that as well okay councillor gibbons yes sir the chair i hardly agree with the gm i can go back a few years when the black springs progress association purchased trees for the village there but the opportunity was for the the people where the trees were outside their house to make sure they lived and they all lived and we took the responsibility of watering and and i 'd support that particular way that the community that down there has some buy-in and opportunity to do something towards it thank you you had a last question councillor mccarthy okay the trees will have mulch around them will they mulch your bum loosen or something like that um through the chair once again i would be probably deferring to the expertise that we have on site but i would be assuming that all those things would be in place yes thank you okay councillors i 'll uh put the recommendation all those in favor and against six that is general business um i 'll ask each individual counselor if they have anything they wish to bring on in general business i 'll start with council line um i just um like to talk about the tree policy and whether we could form a committee including the staff and move this policy along so that we meet a little bit more regularly until we get the policy up and up and going um council line what 's your suggestion for the makeup of that committee and what its terms of reference might be some horticulturalists you recommend i 'm looking at the um the list of trees that um the general manager sent to me i 'm looking at putting that into a i can say a system where the shape of the trees the size of the trees how big they 'll be in certain in a certain period so that we can um have recommendations for people that want to plant trees that come to the town and we look at our town trees in particular that we we have we have ownership of the energy coming and mangling the trees that we have so we need to look at the trees that we have and the trees further planting of the trees whether we 're going to replace some trees in town and with the type of trees that we need to put there so a committee of like people formulate the policy can i suggest that what you do is you actually write something about what you think the committee should be who should be on it and what the terms of reference should be and put that through the general manager and then we 're gonna we can approach that at a an ordinary council meeting okay but i i agree with you i i think it 's it 's important but we need to i think getting something on paper is the first step counselor mckenna um look i i i would support uh council line um i just wonder this should probably be a maybe it 's a sub element of the streetscape subcommittee that we all already have um i i would think and i i think we should to the tree policy that was circulated by general manager and i 've already commented uh that i thought that was a good document um i suggest a few changes but i agree with council line that it deals with the height of a number of trees um maybe a couple are classified incorrectly but also people need to know that the spread of the tree as well as the height which is uh obviously is important but i think we 've got a very good starting point in that tree policy i was actually delighted to see it was quite a good docu a very good document and i think this i think i agree with you uh actually man that we should deal with a whole lot of things as what is the best way to water these trees for instance is count raced by uh councillor cape and respect to the uh warrior lane which i wasn 't part of a the go and and um whether it should be the use of slotted hose and a council employee going around filling that once a week or look at that from a cost and we need some advice technically of cost etc different options so i sort of felt it should be an element of the streetscape committee i think that 's a reasonable reasonable call but again let 's get some some ideas on paper and uh so that we can um make that happen uh gm yeah through the chair sorry mr chair um the free policy is absolutely already a subsidiary of the communification working party the reason why the original document was sent out was because it was part of the terms of reference put together for the street beautification working party if council now on a resolve to separate those two um you could be at locker heads with a tree policy working party competing against a beautification working party so i 'd i 'd probably be walk a little bit wary should you want to separate those two um absolutely i agree with councillor mckibben in terms of we have a good starting point with that existing policy and the reason for the send out of that document to start with so i believe the tree policy as it sits will be a document that is prepared from the beautification working party presented to council but i 'd tread carefully against separating a tree policy working party and a street beautification working party as they might be competing interested the reason why we brought them together was to get a life interest okay thank you council mccarthy i think what uh i could be wrong here but i think what brenda 's trying to say is until we get the tree policy up we need to meet more frequently because last time it 's run into the council briefing and and i think that 's what council aligned is trying to achieve to come up with the result and maybe just for now we 've got to meet more frequently i could be wrong is that what we 're trying to achieve so that 's just through the chair the reason why i 'm trying to provide these documents to councils to get these moving along rather than just keep on talking about one sort of thing like this there 's trying to um to move along so if um if council 's in a position that they want a more they want a more regular meeting for either the beautification working party or the or any other working party please please um provide it to to me because we 're we 're trying to do that do exactly that all right anything else uh council line no thank you all right uh council danny testing oh thank you mr chair uh no i don 't have anything this evening i 'm fairly happy with um quite a few of these uh directional projects we 're undertaking so i 'm i have nothing additional tonight thank you thank you uh council mckinney yes thank you um acting mayor the only only issue um of general business that 's been raised to me um by some residents of scotia avenue is um could council look at putting a priority on extending the concrete footpath along that street it 's um it is one of the uh the inner residential streets and uh quite a lot of um quite a lot of walkers 't disagree with with the the areas that we have footpaths that we have planned to do springfield street and connecting a couple of the fitness streets up fitness paths up um i just think that instead of doing 280 meters in in a new residential street that 's not um fully uh occupied with residents we could maybe do 200 and put another 80 metres on um avenue and but i just was asked to bring it up to could we consider prioritizing that in the uh in the footpath plan that 's all i 've got thank you thank you council mckinney uh councillor cable thank you mr acting there thank you no i don 't have anything in particular to raise thank you thank you councilman kevin thank you uh connecting mayor look a couple of minor issues um in relation to um in particular burrica road um the technical services director the signs there that talk about shoulder closed up the top where that embankment has fallen away keep getting thrown off the road by some larrikins and ending up across the fence um i 've 'm getting a bit sick of doing it i don 't know if we need to lock them um or do something uh maybe we need to whack our iron post it and actually you know wire them up with some strength because they keep getting thrown down the embankment uh the other thing is the between um gilman dike turn off and the end of the shire area where it meets bathurst uh there are some rather i know you 've had a go at looking at the potholes there that i 've raised before but before that triangle bridge the dirt was put in the potholes by the works crew is actually worn out of the potholes and there 's actually another area that 's pretty bad about quite a while maybe a kilometer back from that um where the road has really broken away and i realized that this has occurred in a lot of the areas of the council on roads as a result of the wet weather cold weather and the drought before that but i just raised those couple of points um i in i will myself go up and bash some maxi posts it might be a bit stronger than normal iron posts and try and wire the signs to it that 's probably the best idea as a technical services director yeah i think thanks for the notification uh certainly i 'll get the job and uh we 'll come up with a more robust plan thank you sorry you got more because that 's the only thing now i i if i could generally i i actually mean i just liked one one i wasn 't uh part of the warrior lane it 's a more it 's a general situation a question i would ask um do we need a triple ripper for trees or is a single ripper sufficient i 've always used a single ripper but i only put smaller trees in maybe that 's the reason uh through the chair i am of the opinion a single ripper is more than sufficient um and that was a discussion i certainly had with staff and that was uh something that we 're looking at sourcing um you know future projects which i think single is more than adequate to uh you know facilitate that type of activity but you you talked about a three-time ripper in the warrior lane submission not a single tine ripper you talked about a three-time ripper as i think i read um through the chair it was a three-time ripper but if a single one is more um is a better option we certainly want to go down that path of of getting best value for money well i as i was not entitled to rightly not entitled to talk in that section but this is a general issue that i can raise it now i just question because there are a lot of people with single tine rippers in the oberon district so i have some sympathy for what council mccarthy said but i also know that a single titan ripper uh will be decidedly cheaper than a three-time ripper so i just think we might need to investigate that a little bit more carefully in fact i think if you use a three-time ripper down the sides of some of these but i might be wrong if a single time ripper is the best value for money that 's what we will go with okay uh council mccarthy i just wondering whether council would consider putting the retaining wall on the edith road in the 2020 2021 works program now that there 's funding available from the town improvement funds i understand it was put back into the 2022 because the funds weren 't available but i understand that the funds are now available from council decision the other night so i 'm just asking can this is only the base can it be brought forward into the 2020 2021 works program the general manager through the chair there there is um unallocated funds as rightly suggested by i 'm councillor mccarthy and those funds will need to be um resolved by council to in fact utilize is one of the programs that we 're looking at bringing forward as part of that that report and more than happy to um if that 's a direction from council we 'll include that in the in the um uh in the report happy to bring it back originally there was a a requirement for council to bring back a report on the cctv footage that we 're currently looking into um those pr those um cameras have now been in play for over three months and it was after three months so we put a report back if that 's now an option that council don 't want to see occur or the extension of that cctv and you have another option being this one is something that we 're quite happy to bring back i 'm more than happy to bring it back to um september even now that what happened is the funds were allocated to a project and council never took that option up and they exceeded the amount of money the retaining wall was required to do so that money is now available in the 2020 2021 budget available i 'm just wondering can council get a report back to whichever meeting next month or the month after um to give us the option whether they want to go ahead with it in this financial year um through looking at councillor mccarthy that 's not stop the signs oh so yeah so we 're talking about the same thing so it 's that unallocated provision that we had that we were looking to utilize as part of the signage project that is still unallocated i think that we 're on the same page in terms of what we 're what we 're proposing okay thank you thank you mr me thank you uh councillor gibbons you still muted council gibbons now you 're on you just want to talk about the reef uh reserve for a minute and see if we can come up with some ideas how we can uh stop the hooliganism that 's been going down there not only over the snow event but some of our local boys uh we tried to change the road network a little bit there in one stage so it didn 't go near a private property and and they 've reopened that track which at least to erase and then they 've gone straight down over the form track and into the fence there i just think if or someone that 's interested come up with a bit of a plan to do some practical things there like a few logs or a few rocks to make sure they cannot get on some of these tracks that we don 't want them on and also we try to get some top soil cover on another area where they rip up this bank and down to see how far they can get up look there 's simple ways we can do it but uh you know i can take that up with the technical services if i can come back with a report or something but i just think it 's it certainly got out of hand and i think we all know we spent a fair bit of money there gravelling sites and it 's a burnout site now so i i think it 's a great spot down there and a lot of people get a great lot of value from it and with a few simple alterations there we might be able to heal up and fix some of the damage that 's been done there that or do you think it 's bigger than that do we need a bit of a committee to look into that or i asked the gm what he feels [Music] through the chair i 'd suggest uh that in the first instance is let the technical service director and maybe them yourself counselor meet and have a look at what would be required to identify some of these things that we 've outlined there this evening um we 're certainly aware of it and we 've certainly made some representations in terms of how you stop that type of activity um if anyone has the answer please let me know because at this point in time it 's not just that spot that we 're chasing that type of activity it 's it 's um something that we have to deal with every every week unfortunately but yeah more than happy for um a a report to come back in terms of what the results of that investigation are because um everything you 've raised at this point in time is going to cost thanks for that one just a bit of an incident down there last thursday night and it 's probably the first time there has been one to my attention in 15 or 20 years but there was just no lighting in that top half of the of the common right down there 's a light on way down the bottom between the second and third dam somewhere but uh call the police and to direct them and do some things that was all happened in a very dark spot and it could have been fairly nasty i 'm just not sure what the answer is but we 've tried to get them working they work for a while i 've done the solar panels done how it all works i really think we need that lighting that we can be sure that it 's going to work so that 's something we 're going to have to have a good hard look at i think that that 's it for this movie thanks thank you council gibbons um i have one item and it 's to provide clarification of an article that appeared in the it won 't affect the d.a or consideration thereof but the item was that there that invoices had not been provided to waldara i can report to all councillors that the invoices were provided on the 15th of october 2019 and shortly after that um negotiations were entered into by waldara and the council which has resulted in the um the modification da that we received on the 21st of august uh councils that 's uh i have nothing else is uh and unless there 's any good reason i will close the meeting at 6 43. um i suggest we all take a break from _"

age 10 councillors notice the submission 1001 notice of appreciation the motion is that council is not standing for re-election in the upcoming 2000 to 2001 local government be acknowledged for the community contribution they 've had to the overall community and i 'll have a done a sterling job we all came together four and a half years ago now and uh we 've been through a number of um difficult times and good times but at all times we have remained on friendly terms and work together well um i learned a lot from all councillors but i 've learned that from councillor dhoni who 's been here since 2008 i understand i 've learned that you should always maintain a sense of humor and always get your last word in that you can [Laughter] always be right yes from kerry gibbons i 've learned from council gibbons i 've learned more about rhodes than i ever ever ever thought i needed to know and i thank you immensely gary because i didn 't know i needed to know that much and you 'll i regret you are a grand teacher thank you um brenda had printed council lines had done a stint beforehand of course and came back again in 2017 and she brought her flair for flowers and trees to the common and to the street landscape and i thank her for he was never going to make it so he spent most of the time in hospital before the before the election um and in fact this time last year he was in pretty dire straits um for the candidate his wife jen presentation for you um it 's nice to have an old grazia who to give me advice about various things and what ways things can be done and i thank you for that and for you and your friendship job and now madame for you um 2012 you started when you were a counsellor um you took over on the death of and that must have been a very very difficult time for you you then went into a probably an equally difficult time with amalgamation and having to leave this council as communities through that terrible uh traumatizing period and um you did that with an extraordinary grace um i watch you constantly in the way you deal with things you 're you might be like that that swan with the legs going flat out but we were very serene on the surface and i think that i 'm amazed how any one person can be so well connected to so many places and people in the community i don 't think i 've ever mentioned someone to you that you don 't know and that 's because of all the work you do around the community which goes well beyond what that that 's normally required or expected of that so it 's been a been an interesting three-year term it 's now gone for four and a half and a quarter years um and i wish all those who are not standing well and getting your life back in some way and um for the ones that are staying on and standing we have we have an electoral place um but i 'd also like to i suppose uh speak of each of the individuals um i 'd like to thank councillor gibbons for all his counsel and advice over the period to all of us um his knowledge and he 's been on the council a long time and his knowledge of road works and the process of the council and the community as and i certainly think he 's been invaluable for his efforts to this council um councillor dhoni um i 've really enjoyed sparring with you um you have a great sense of humor um you can be very self-deprecating and you 've really done very very well for the o 'connell community and for the community as a whole but i think o 'connell should be indebted to you for all you 've done for them i think you 've been a great counsellor as well council alone um i 've had the pleasure of serving with you on the streetscape committee um and your knowledge of plants and what we should do to beautify this town i think is an inspiration to us all and i fully appreciate all the efforts you 've done in those and your great knowledge of what we should be doing to do that and and your contribution especially in that area has been fantastic for this council and i only hope that we can move forward and finally create your ultimate vision for this town uh don cable i 've had the great who is a person of abundant common sense um abundant common sense and i 've also had the great pleasure of serving with him on the upper macquarie county council and it has been a true pleasure it really has a great fellow grazia um but also always can see through the issues and find out and facilitate a resolution it 's been um fantastic to serve with you and madame mayor may i say i have never seen a harder working mayor you have been fantastic you 're at every function you 're at every event and how you get it done i don 't know um i know some accuse me of not sleeping but i 'm sure you don 't sleep i don 't have sheep but you do you you have represented this community uh very well as mayor and formerly as a counselor and i think that this community of auburn must be forever indebted for your efforts and your work that has been so selfless and the time you have committed to this community so i think councillors all i 've only been on think has been fantastic about this council and maybe i i wouldn 't say i would compare it to some of our councils around is that we are not political we 're not fractions we 're unified we respect each other we all get together shake our hands and have a laugh at the end of the meeting you know we don 't always get our way but it just doesn 't matter we 're all committed to do what we believe is correct for this community absolutely committed and we do that i think we have done it very well in this term and i can only hope that the council going forward in the new term whoever they may be can carry that forward i think as a council on the respect we have showed for each other and the way we have conducted ourselves albeit that our meetings are somewhat quite long um is probably an example to other other councils in this state um i don 't think there 'd be a more unified body it doesn 't matter what our politics it doesn 't matter individually for what we believe is the correct on each particular issue so madame i i 'm very very happy to second this motion thank you councilman is there any other comment on this recommendation councilman good morning please let um it 's been it has been great um councilman kevin um yes summed up a lot of the things that i would say and and i think there 's nothing more boring than going to a meeting where everybody agrees with each other but the wonderful thing about this council is that we we have our say we generally come to a consensus and then at the end of the end of the meeting we go and have a glass of wine and a cold chinese and as if as if we hadn 't nothing 's happened and i think this is really a great um thing about this council and i just hope that the uh the council 's the next council is the same and the ongoing councils are the same again um thank you thank you for all the kind words um i 'm sorry that few people that i think i would be a better counselor in with another term um because we spent uh half of half of this term um learning how it all works um and i i wish the council well thank you councillor councillor online thank you um thank you to those counsellors that said those kind words i 'd just like to say that after a 40-year break from being on council i can notice massive improvements in the way the council is run i can now say that i 'm very very proud to belong to the oberon community and i wish the new council the new councillors that are coming on board and all the staff that have worked so hard over the last four years all the best thank you thank you councilwoman is there any other comment he comes with council gibbons can you hear me or not counselor can 't hear me can you hear me we can oh great i i just like to thank you all for the friendships that i 've made and the great knowledge that has been floating around yours all so thanks for the journey thanks for the ride thank you councillor gibbons councillor joni thank you very much they 're very kind words from all commentators other fellow counsellors i feel the opportunity to have done this has been a privilege and as i too continue to look at the performance of other councils the nature of the meetings the nature of their debates and the nature of their relationships then i think we can hold our heads up very high as a council that is committed primarily to its community it 's been a pleasure if i had another two lives i 'd keep going thank you for your forbearance and i wish you all the very best thank you councilman i would also like to thank everybody for their very very kind words and the only thing that 's really left for me to say because i think everybody said it all is to thank all counsellors for their support and particularly the staff for their support because without the staff support we wouldn 't be able to be the cohesive council that we are put the foundation all in carriage unanimously thank you age 11 councillors i can do exempt development notion is that overall council adopt a code of planning practice that machinery and fodder storage shares be classed as exempt in the rural are one-zoned areas of oberon council local government area as it be considered auxiliary to farming requirements and move the police councillors councillor mccarthy and the second to place ask council mccarthy to speak to his recommendation i would just like a clarification i think for this to pass has to go before the state i believe and i 'm going to ask the director of planning to just outline how this could or couldn 't work before we then discussed the recommendations so if i could go to the director thank you madam through the chair um the attorney hierarchy in new south wales starts off with the aware the environment assessment act followed by the state of viral planning policies council 's land use strategy local environment plan and dcp development control plan currently the farm buildings identified as machinery and fodder sheds would be contained within that was brought in by the state government in 2009 council adopted that as the standard across in new south wales took that on board um farm buildings are currently executed up to 200 metres squared um there are other development standards so to change the um requirements uh in in oberon from the state um environment policy would would would need to form part of council 's land use strategy and review which is proposed to commence next year a review of the lep followed by the dcp um so to change to bring that in line would need to be considered as part of that those changes moving forward um and be to be considered by the community and council the only current council in new south wales that does not buy the current exempted confined development code is bathurst um and there 'll be a long process to make changes to the minister of planning but that would form part of our review that would commence next year council mccarthy did you wish to speak to this recommendation yeah i 've been doing some research for a said but you 've got to start the change sooner or later i think we 've got to get off the minister ministerial people and get this changed an example of this is recently it took through the portal three months to get a shed approved three months there 's a desisting shed there when the staff member of open council done it usually why wasn 't that considered to be an existing chef replacement what we need to do these people don 't build big sheds speaking to 200 square meters because they want to be smart with council or something like that they need them for the size of their activity of their business now we had it up to 300 square meters as our exempt compliant but one of the people who work as a consultant for us talk to us and recommend to the council that we stay with the 200 square meters bathurst fought for it and they maintained it they fought against the state government and they keep it up to the 300 so if you want a 300 square metre shed your logic property fits the criteria which is uh it 's done on a land base not a ru one it 's done on a land base in other words if you 've got more than four hectares you can have a certain size shed if you 've got more than a certain land you can get it bigger i know i 'm going to lose this one but you 've got to start somewhere and we need to shake the tree and get this improved i was here when that member from the state government come along and said oh we 're going to make the sheds 200 square meters exempt we 're all already having three and he took something away from us he 's been replaced about three times over we 've got to get down to the grassroots and get these approved there 's people need sheds for grain storage now saying that all you can 't get a container to send grain overseas you can 't get a silo things like that these are things that are happening all the time and our state government aren 't and make these sheds more easier to pick up put up and what 's saying and like in one of my submissions here we have large phony operations that have put sheds up i 've watched the thing there 's no da 's been submitted from them and nothing happens so you know a lot of people want to do the right thing but some of the bigger companies who operate here and mauree and places like that they put bigger sheds up and think nothing of it and we don 't say vood to them so anyway i i think we 've got to start this action rolling somewhere in the state government and get sheds exempt to fit on the rural land as i submitted thank you [Music] oh um listen i appreciate what the director of planning has said and on as i 've seconded this i can 't propose an amendment if i wasn 't you know i don 't think that if i was yeah another council i was probably proposing an amendment to suggest that this be considered as part of the iep and year and i 'd be also asking the director of planning if you could consider what bathurst introduced or what what i think it was about it 's the sliding scale as i think council mccarthy said you 've got this size you can have up to this size the bigger the property the bigger the shed you 're allowed which is absolutely suitable for me because we you know we don 't want someone before hectares having a 300 meter square i understand that so i 'm suggesting a sliding scale um as i said i can 't suggest this design second but another member of council might uh at least propose an amendment that that be considered that we defer the this proposal to the next term of council and be part of the land use strategy review varying minds including the exciting scales used by uh baptist for others so the if you defer this proposal to the next term the proposal to the next term of council what was after that council uh including um consideration of the fighting scales involved as used by backers and and you don 't sorry next time this is in relation to machinery you thought a story is so you bring that somewhere in there because this is going to be thrown out well let 's when when when the secretary has got that down we 'll put it up and the amendment as it sits there is that over on council adopt i 'm sorry i 'm just trying to share that the proposal will be deferred until the next council and that it form part of the land use strategy review sorry part of the lep review and that the proposal will include consideration of the sliding scale for development of machinery and photoshoots on a sliding scale you probably probably don 't need it if i don 't want to beat damien can we just say review of your strategic planning processes or strategic planning documents yeah strategic planning documents cancels [Music] you happy with that comes from kellogg do i have a secondary counselor counselor kellum do you wish to speak to them on the amendment counselors i 'm putting the amendment councillors that the proposal that it formed part of the council 's strategic planning documents and that the proposal will include consideration of thank you of the sliding scale for development of machinery and photojet all in favor carried unanimously thank you that the amendment now becomes emotional all in favor promotion the nation 's carried thank you councillors council and delegate reports item 1101 up on the quarry county council meeting 15th of october 2021 i will note that the author of this uh report is councillor people not councilman mckibben has stated and the recommendation is the report item 1101 is received as information can i have someone to move this please counselor cable thank you and the secretary kevin thank you you wish to speak to this councillor [Music] i think uh it 's covered there the as i said there the the main um yeah well probably the most important business of the day was uh accepting the resignation of the general manager of the county council who will be most sorely missed by the council he 's done a terrific job with really putting it on its feet um he was going to be staying for a long time when [Music] with the recommendation all in favor encourage unanimously thank you page 13 councillors item 1102 countryman 's association meeting 5th of november 2021 the recommendation is that the report item is received and noted can i have a mover please counselors council mccarthy in a second please counselor thank you thank you you wish to speak to the recommendation council on the company pretty straightforward thank you a few times [Music] exactly [Music] [Applause] um thank you very much yes i was a little bit confused as to the attachments too i just wonder whether the comment at the bottom of page 13 actually relates to a previous set of minutes it should be it does it relates to the name of the general meeting of the agm though the general meeting may meeting that was reported to the june council meeting that 's right so it shouldn 't be taken well it 's a summary of the resolutions well it 's not because it talks to you well it is a summary of the resolutions counselor because what they 've done on the party projects and that that 's what that is however this has been a copy paste i believe and that is how it appears in in the minutes and i understand i understand it 's all a little bit confusing yes i do understand that okay and then i thought i was just getting yeah probably thank you any other comments your counselors i 'm putting the recommendation on this label no page yeah 840 1103 rule 5 service the recommendation is report item 1103 will be received and noted can i have a mover please council mccarthy and a second to please counselor keller council mccarthy did you speak to this recommendation um yes madam mayor the first um paragraph 's pretty straightforward the captains are going to write to the manager of um chiefly with go zone i 'm just requesting the second part that having council write to the commissioner and point out that the premier citation and caps haven 't been all placed supplied i spoke to annette down at lithgow and she was going to get back to me to brett taylor today and he wasn 't aware that they all weren 't filled um i double checked with jeff ryan over at uh rockley and his team haven 't all got this so it 's a pretty poor effort for someone who 's given a lot of voluntary labour so i think um to sort of hard plane with cabot i can 't see you can blame code from citation and a cab anyway i just requested the open council write a letter to the commissioner pointing out that this hasn 't been done fulfilled i 'm i 'm happy to do that to council mccarthy i 'm trying to find out the number of uh people that were missed and who they were um i can 't find that out i 'll write a more general letter okay um indicated that he had all the names that attended but he doesn 't know all the ones that don 't fulfill them that 's the hard part because um neil has some citations and caps yeah because he doesn 't want to get him out because some of certainly write it later thank you not a problem council killing did you wish to speak to this any other comments counsellors for the recommendation all in favor aye thank you page 41 councillors item committee reports item 1201 cta audit risk and improvement committee here 's the recommendation in two parts that the report item 1201b receivers information and that the central tablelands alliance audit risk and improvement from the 2020-21 annual report be received and noted can i have a mover please counselor kellerman a second announcement now tell them do you wish the three independent auditors it is likely that we will go to uh we will be exploring i suspect uh an eric based upon a joint organisation model i think one of the more interesting parts is the uh the depreciation amortization impairment which is up 64 and of course what that comes from is not anything except natural disasters and the fact that with all the extra infrastructure we 've generated in the last 12 months uh extra infrastructure means a lot more depreciation comes with it and that 's that 's life iteration um that the eric sticks to the independent members this time we 're a little bit uh very focused on the financials uh and not on performance orders and i think there needs to be a bit of balance there between the two but um that 's that that 's in the past now and we 're moving on into the future and we 'll be a different organisation next year thank you [Music] yes um i suppose the first thing i was wondering it 's it may be it 's question for here or maybe later when we consider the other financial statements um the extension of time um for the lodgement uh of the accounts i think it was to the auditor council at the end of november 2012 correct was that why was that necessitated just because we needed staff issues um or before was it because eric and before our order hadn 't had time to consider them properly you know through the chair the extension of time was on the back of covert related as well as staff matters that we went through in the changes that we received last night i think it was to the unordered financial accounts which seem to be as a role in discussions between eric and our external auditors is that correct that 's correct to try and finesse depreciation and a number of other issues i was surprised that with the expertise on our eric that they didn 't pick some of those up that 's a question through the chair the aric committee members dealt with the information that they had before them um in fact our it was raised by our external auditor the issues that we were addressing so it was raised at that point in time and that 's where the that 's where the investigation started in terms of trying to um account for that the amortization and depreciation in the right in the right process or in a different process that we had undertaken it and that 's where the the new um outcomes have been provided to council right so with the increase in appreciation i know we foreshadowed this last year because of our increased asset values and the amount more assets to depreciate do we have a projection how that 's likely to affect our accounts going forward after this i mean it 's going to have an effect and we were concerned about it this year and that would make sense because of going to a loss sorry about a minute because of because of the amount of the pressure through that share i think that this is going to have an impact purely on the base of the amount of grant funding that we 're achieving um which you know sizable projects so so the problem is going to be exacerbated again next year um through the chair i think that the the role of depreciation in in accounting standards that is going to be an ongoing challenge for not only this career but for all councils there is a lot of talk in local government governance circles around how councils in fact deal with depreciation and how that this book entry that we talk about has the opportunity to be accounted for differently and look at options around doing that so it 's a conversation that of it certainly the order office is aware of of these challenges that that local government have in this space so we may be in the corporate world you have a term called even which is earnings before interest tax depreciation um maybe the state government would have to consider something like that i know tax doesn 't apply in this but it is a corporate term that is used and they are seriously seriously considering how this needs to be dealt with yeah right okay fine thank you that 's all i have madame you make a very good point thank you councillor any other made some comments about the ongoing um eric and how it sits i 'll just add a little bit more to that that we are no longer in the dark about how an arix should operate with some guidelines that we put out by the office of local government and the reason that we 'll be looking to review that is purely based on the requirements of that of that um guideline that that eligible has put out in terms of how they want that we move towards a different was it the original uncirculated months ago yes ah i think yes it 's just the the original one was in draft form now it 's been successful okay yeah that 's what hell just wanted that any other comments counselor i 'm putting the recommendation all in favor harry thank you this reports the decision item 1301 over on water treatment plant replacement membrane bioreactor filtration filters t2021-16 it 's a recommendation in two parts that council nominate the selective tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 166 bracket b of the local government regulation 2005 for the supply and installation of new water treatment filters at the oberon water treatment plant tender t 2021-16 and that a further report be presented to councils february 2022 ordinary meeting at the conclusion the tendering period for resolution of the third contractor can i have a move up let 's count from the given cluster table councilman kevin do you wish to speak today um thank you madam eric obviously this is an essential item um my only concern is that the cost of pipes are going to have a significant effect on our water funding why are correct because we 've already just accepted i think it 's now yes it 's now a common knowledge that part possible accepted attendance obviously pipes out um if i can put it in those raw words um and this has obviously got an expense that it is envisaged will um exceed 250 000 i or could exceed i could exceed 250 000 so those two together um but we 're we 're probably looking at a four hundred thousand plus hit to our waterfront it 's a big um but we have no options so we have to move ahead and we were hoping obviously that some of the more fun assets may be available for wasn 't the sewage treatment plant that continued anyway that 's fine we 've got no option thank you councillor councillor catholic yeah yes it is but um as councilman said we have no option we committed funding to this in the operational plan filters need replacing they 're going to be expensive staff have undertaken significant research and it it has to be done okay is there any other comment there 's a question for you madam um does that mean seven to eight years is a normal expected life expectancy of such a piece of infrastructure through you yeah through the through the chair yet certainly the term i 've been at a productive sense no more than probably 10 years it 's probably the maximum life at this stage in terms of the i suppose the variable conditions that we 've gone with through with the raw water has had an impact and again they are they are challenged with pre-chlorinated water from northern south wales which does make them susceptible to the life of the actual set so we have um in the long term financial uh planning have strategically put money aside for this replacement so whilst it is a lot of money it 's certainly something that we expected to take uh to undertake at this particular time of its life thank you any other comments counselling captain assistant clarification so we have been putting money away for these membranes or yeah through proportionately last year in anticipation of combining with additional funding and this financial year to complete this work so okay so we haven 't been put them away over the period of ten years or um two so we don 't get a big hit like this at once yeah through the chair certainly waterfront is certainly accumulating but yeah it 's again it is strategically um viewed at every 10 years or thereabouts that this is going to be required so money has to be put aside as part of that financial planning planning what i 'm getting at if so should we be putting 15 thousand away into a fund each year to facilitate it so we don 't have the hundred and fifty thousand wouldn 't that go into normal maintenance um so again the fund yeah through this year so money does accumulate within the water fund uh in reserves and is proportionally banked on in terms of that when that asset does come due yes so money is um the count of four even though it 's our game last financial year putting that toward the term not bringing the project forward any sooner but again recognizing that it is quite a large quantity of money um but i guess it 's going to be through the chair there was no significant increase in water rates to cater for this it had been catered for over a period of time what i 'm getting at is should we not be putting fifteen thousand dollars away each year for the membranes only because when this was designed we elected to go with that recommendation of these membranes and i thought in the past the staff had actually changed the membranes over when mr robbins was here and uh foreign pretty laborious job and uh yeah anyway i see where it 's been required that the contract will be provided but it shouldn 't be this will be an ongoing thing that should be put away for that specific thing not not just in your waterfront for that specific use through the chair that 's where you do fund it from i realize that so it 's a project within the waterfront yes you 're right so you program how much money you put across to the water fund i understand what person mccarthy 's saying it 's inclusive of these replacements to it so it is not a specific 15 000 put somewhere difference of this specific project it 's it goes into the maintenance fund which encompasses the future maintenance needs of the plant correct that 's great restricted reserves i was looking at page 173 three of the financial accounts and i was just following on from council mccarthy 's i was just trying to find noting with the total current assets under 2.805 minimum no reference to any restricted as far as i can see there 's nothing to say there 's no restricted fund within the water fund to say that much is respected all in favor terry thank you age 50 counselors in 1302 dedication or mayoral duties the recommendation is that council delegate to mrs clappy said which the authority to carry out civic and ceremonial functions of the mayoral office between election day and the holding of the mayoral election after the local government election do i have a councilman technically do you wish to speak to them um not really i don 't need to be anyone better than qualified to do that 's one thing did you wish to speak to this only to madam mayor that it um you know it 's a result of the recent change um i wish that 's you and not here thank you south wales for business the recommendation is that council delegates authority to the general manager to enter into a partnership agreement with services advice can i have a mover councilman kevin and the second place council kellen thank you so i 'm quite happy to remove this recommendation opportunities through service new south wales expanding through the council offices i think it 's been a great passage any other comments from your counselors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you okay 53 councillors item 1304 end of term report 2019-21 community strategic plan there is a change there um in the recommendation that it should read 2019 to 2021 not 22 as in the comment so i 'll put the recommendation that counts the end of term report for the 2019-21 reporting period if i can get a mover please counseling intervention and a second opposed counselor kevin thank you councilman kevin do you wish to speak to history thank you madam i did read the end of term report the early hours of the morning um and i found a very thorough report so i come in with obviously commend this recommendation thank you chancellor excellent any other comments counselors with the recommendation all in favor unanimously thank you page 54 counselors item 1305 2020 21 annual report the recommendation is in three parts the council will receive the annual report for the year and ending 30th of june 2021 as information the council approve and upload the annual report onto overall council 's website by the 30th of november 2021 and that council will notify the office of local government that the annual report is on oberon 's account over on council 's website and provide a copy of the annual report to the minister in accordance with section four two six bracket five of the local government 1993. do i those dr kellen thank you councillor cable would you wish to speak to this one i need to say that uh yeah that 's what we do it 's a very good report counselor any other comments councilman kevin um the only that i have is the i take the order of the financial statements that will be attached to these are the finally approved ones um what piano ones that are currently reviewing through the chair that would be correct which is why it has to be up by the 30th of november 2021 right so when is this going to be submitted by the 30th with the attached financials um the only other only thing i would just one that i just made was but in the diagram on page what 's page 43 that 's page six the annual report in the attachments down there it 's the organizational structure in the annual report do we need to delineate here that the strategic issues that is the that is the way and for operational it actually starts with the general energy it works down because we don um an overarching commitment to your community to say the community is first and then but is the organization is the organizational structure on that page 43 commit because we have to look at strategic vis-a-vis operational issues and councils are not really in that chain for operational issues that are advertised um yes there should be two strengths certify that an operational which would be different if we don 't have any responsibility for operations [Music] through the chair we can delineate that through through a process with council the new council will be doing a review um [Music] the way forward any other comments here counsellors put the recommendation in three parts all in favor harry thank you 59 councillors item 1306 town improvement project budget reallocation the recommendation is that council approved the reallocation of 70 000 from the cook park awning extension to the commons to cover the cost of proposed projects by the common working party the council notes the new reporting format for monthly account improvement expenditure remove the police counselors that 's the calendar the second eye councilor darling thank you willing to the best way of putting it um and i think it 's very appropriate to reallocate that money to uh the commons thank you councilman do you wish to speak to and understand our use of town improvement funds and i think we do a very good job of it thank you councillor any other comments council mccarthy yes um i disagree with the reallocation of the money i think with a bit more effort we 're going to do a redesign the post out behind the curb where the power pole is and the rest and do a totally different structure so we don 't interfere with the building that is in front of it the building in front of it is not heritage listed and i 'm [Music] really disappointed that this has gone on for so long in respect it was tribute to the design that went out to our engineering firm and it showed the original plans for these posts out the front which were round now the person that done these ones was mr sedona and he said to lee robbins at the time if cost but the plan went out to this engineering firm was still the old round pipe which scalloped the braces really expensive so we 've never gone and got the cost properly what i think we should do is retain the money give the old give the people an over and somewhere where they can walk along that footpath without slipping over the snow and ice in the winter and protection from the rain we won 't we haven 't been able to come up with agreements with the people that own the premises but we step away from there getting close to their property and actually do the awning with a cantilever off the curb and gunner and i think to prop up the short form but there are avenues we have 23 million dollars in running out there we 've just got to search a bit harder to find some money that can prop that shortfall up and one of the things when i was reading through the common report now chapter give the engineering report to do the stone walls allowed 5000 for an engineer and then a duplication for these five thousand we can save straight on one project in there with that wall so i think within council if we try a bit harder we can facilitate the short form and we can retain the seven bet seventy thousand dollars for the warning and get on with that awning and get it completed thank you council mccarthy do you really have a comment on this counselor oh yes thank you madam man i um i would like to see the awning go ahead um it 's um it 's a gap in the street there where there 's no protection from the snow and on frosty slippery uh surfaces um it 's in an area where there 's a lot of pedestrian traffic to the park into the amenities i think there 's a good um case for continuing the awning through so there 's no no gap there i agree with council mccarthy i think if we looked a little bit harder we could certainly find a way to overcome the land holder and boundary issues virtual mirror or a simple almost mirror reverse from the uh from the shop down to the baby shop down to the coil block and move the posts out to the kerbinger side would more or less do the job i think if we use the right construction materials with the right strength so i don 't think does it i don 't even look it hard enough you know we 're just saying it 's too hard it 's not too hard we 've got the wrong people looking at it we are we 've got plenty of engineers in town plenty of team that can do that um but i just can 't see why i was saying it 's too hard it 's not too hard it 's very easy i 'd be surprised if there 's not something left over from the 17th house seems an awful lot for um for what we 're going to get there i think so i 'm against removing the money from this i 'm not against prop uh the work at the corn more for it but i 'm against moving it from this to the project the southern side on the shady side of the street that 's you know we get complaints all the time about the slipperiness and what we 're doing about the paving and making it safe for pedestrians and we 've got this yawning gap there that we do nothing about because we think it 's too hard i can tell you i 've seen engineers design a lot more harder things than that that 's not too hard it 's absolutely ridiculous that we 're not doing it cool school tactics students could design that counselor director would like to yeah um thanks man i just wanted to respond about the technicality um and i totally agree that it 's not a difficult project by all means it 's certainly from an engineering functionality can be done the the main concern is with the the owner i suppose in terms of the um aesthetic nature of the the building and what the impact it may have is their concerns coming up with a suitable um design that will not even cost i suppose on the front of the building is so that in itself i 'm not quite sure about the historic nature that 'd be something that i need to get clarified but the proponent is happy to work with council and not opposed to putting something there but just what that structure looks like and it can be done by a reverse mode of the rear of the curb perhaps in relation to the existing utility that runs parallel on the footpath uh adjacent to the property boundaries so it 's not that it can 't_''_4127.679 be done it 's just that complex discussion at the minute of striking a happy medium medium in an agreement i think that 's where we 're at with that can i ask you a question sorry if we don 't move this money what other options are there um to find the seventy thousand dollars required to complete the projects that we 've already resolved to do in the comments and through the chair if you don 't find money to and remember this money is a transfer between your um town improvement fund it 's not finding money from somewhere working party talked about at the last meeting um if you don 't move the fund you 're going to be short in one of your projects and you 've prioritised under the common working party commitments and that would mean that that project or a project would not be done would not be complete in this year that 's correct thank you councilman kevin um thank you very much i 'm i foreshadow an amendment that um and the concept would be that we 'd approve the relocation of these funds however i would i would be foreshadowing that we have a 0.3 the council through the technical services director uh further investigate the proposal for the ornic extension political part awning extension and come back to council with a proposal that would solve the problem and is acceptable to the building owners [Music] february next year march next year maybe um and we can then we would then have time to consider it for fun and and that in doing that he also provides to us a revised pricing of what he thinks it will cost but i to come back with that report so that would be i 'm not changing one or two i 'm adding three so i i will put that formally as a proposed amendment okay a second so so councillors the amendment is adding 0.3 that council further investigate the proposal for the cook park awning extension and provide a proposal that would solve the problem and is acceptable to the owner of the adjacent property to be provided by march 2022 is that your amendment counseling the support issue i suppose it 's the support i think the issues the issues will be right that is acceptable okay that 's fine think it 's simple or not you have a second counselor for any discussion on the amendment council table did you wish to comment on that [Music] i can understand why we need money to finish off the project at the common um however that is an extraordinarily dangerous area up there uh for for a large part of the winter um we go up there and throw a bit of salt on it and that uh has two effects uh it deteriorates the paving even more quickly than uh it 's deteriorating anyway um yeah so so i think it 's some urgency that that needs to be addressed up there because it is very dangerous thank you councilman is there any other comment on the counselor tell them here i think what we 've got here is two diametrically opposed parts of the resolution we 're approving really a reallocation of several thousand dollars and then we 're saying further investigation they 're they 're mutually exclusive i 'm happy that we that we in fact take out the first paragraph which is about reallocation of money and leave just two and three and three number one or two that 's as could be but we allocate reallocate seventy thousand dollars and do a further investigation because the money 's already gone well the money could be taken then from somewhere else once we get it once we get a plan i think that 's the intent and i did say we get a revised pricing i think that was the only issue that 's missing we get we can actually make a case without a new allocation which would then be more absolutely i think i think this is this uh putting dessert in there we keep the money there we note the new reporting format and we do a further investigation so that now works with one word changed through the chair what that will do we should be able to to approve the spend the 70 grand down there i agree and then and then uh investigate the proposal up here on the footpath and find the money from somewhere i agree um and and in a there any other comment on the recommendation amendment as it sits there councillors that 's true council mccachney should should we add something there that says in a report back to council including costing and funding sources like the 22. i 'm happy with that [Music] that recovery comes from kepney yeah i 'm happy with that and i think my entrance the general manual would identify our funding sources much [Music] last year we voted for the signs and there was a set amount of money we all of a sudden we 've completed the assigned project because we didn 't have enough money to complete it so we found the money in this financial year didn 't_''_4662.719 through the chair the science project was council uh secured that money through a grant fund yep with five other projects the signage fund had a has a um an add-on that councils approved a plan around how it will continue to roll out these projects and there was a funding shortly there was a shortfall in the funding there was a there was a unspent contribution with the other grant funds that council contributed to the science fund to do more than what they did than what they um originally resolved to do because it was all under the one funding agreement you could interplay the okay all right i 'll play the game so i i just see this thing is what we 're talking about with it if we have an abnormality or something goes wrong we can find the money to fix it whether it be an engineering abnormality or something like that in here keep the funds there for the cook park awning surely goodness with 23 million dollars sitting there we should be able to find some money to top up the common thunder ti fund facilitate what we 've budgeted for this year sorry but that 's okay i think that by proceeding with the with the common projects and coming back with a proper design and report counsel when the money can then be found is exactly what you 're talking about just maybe in a different sequence well if we if we did budget x amount to the shade sales down there in a budget not a grant and then we found out that the footings were we 'd we 'd have found the money like we have and that 's what i 'm getting at somewhere along the line with that 23 million sitting there there 's enough funds there to do both projects thank you thank you i 'll take that as a comment councilman copy and i 'm going to put the amendment in three parts all in favor harry thank you the amendment now becomes notional 61 councils in 1307 stormwater drainage improvements start street overall is the recommendation in two parts that council proceed to undertake drainage rectification works and construct new drainage infrastructure and curb and gutter on both sides of dart street from earl street to the end but council fund these works during the 2021-22 financial year and transfer funds from section seven eleven urban development size drainage contributions in the amount of up to ninety one thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars to complete these urban improvement works can i have a mover please do have a motor council of tough solidarity and councilman thank you mr mccarthy did you wish to speak to this one yeah i probably shouldn 't have done that my concern is the paragraph too that did work be taken on in this financial year and with our actual works that 's going on outside i really think that that 's not possible so we 're not going to get places like the lowe 's mount road done and we 're going to be behind with the london hill road and things like that i i this works got to be done in little that a lot of the water drainage goes to the end of the school then stops and then floods but yeah through the chairs certainly um the only way this could be facilitated would be by external resourcing contracting to assist and bring it to fruition it was done this financial year and we 've began most likely what and how we have been doing uh a lot of fertility works does also it does require contractual work so it 's really the decision for council whether we receive this financial year with external resources or prefer it into one into the next financial year is there any guarantee that there 'll be less infrastructure happening next financially or i don 't think so uh yeah through the tubes certainly there 's no guarantee so i think it 's going to still continue to be quite busy so it 's uh yeah but a catch again it 's the necessary work that you know certainly would benefit residents down there just beyond going uh you know control of water thank you um um just in relation to the pricing of it have we sought any external quotes for doing this work as part of our estimate through the chair we 've been going through uh all the basics being quoted on what we as we know it previous more current works that we 're but we haven 't got an individual quote for this one no not as yet because i certainly haven 't got an endorsement from council to do so how how good do we think that our estimate is that 's near enough where we 're going to be with regards to that construction are there likely to be any unforeseen issues latent issues that we 're likely to discover that we don 't know about uh through the chair again we 've uh scoped the scientific as well i don 't believe that that 's the case otherwise we would have had it in our pricing right so we 're not going to get unnecessary rock or something that suddenly puts the price up i 'm just a bit wary of what happened with the sales of the infrastructure as i 've noted in the report that we 're going to connect to so i don 't ascertain that there 's going to be a problem so if we did it ourselves and i take it but probably the timing for doing ourselves would not be this financial year or next financial year what would be the cost savings if any uh i don 't think they 'd be negligible either way other than material price increases that potentially influence so do we have um or do we have i think we have to draw that the pipes etc necessary for this now what do we have are they on pre-order or do we have to buy them uh through the chair look certainly the the lead times wouldn 't be an issue uh if we had to acquire additional materials um but the price of the concrete pipes was going up i understand you 're like anything steel is also so you know it 's it 's the inflation that we uh you know certainly would be subjected to on all stages this period of time yes going up for just quotes from a few companies yeah certainly we certainly have to obtain a few quotations uh which would be the most appropriate way of doing it once without procurement a while ago um in a different time we were talking about a uh urban storm water reservoir down in the town way back during a drought i 'm just wondering whether this and i 'm looking at you know seeking advice on the engineering should that consideration ever come up again will this facilitate that or i think that certainly the disposal mechanism is in the natural greenish course as you should be in the same area that 's right so should the council in the future live in it due to the known fact that the woods goes under that house just below earl street in your plane should we not be continuing the curtain gut at the end of the lane i 'm pretty sure i think well from what we have included at this stage we can capture it into certainly curb inlet lentils and push it underground there shouldn 't be a of dart street into into raleigh street just to control that that water from skipping out of the existing table drain now and across the road which then transpires down that hollow lane so we feel confident with kerb returns we should go to control that thank you councilman recommendation all in favor thank you before councilman 's item 1308 repurpose section 356 funded request the recommendation is that over on council approved the request ripped the request from varuga district community association to repurpose the 2021 section 356 donation of 500 dollars for restoration works at oracle hall do i have a mover council mckibben and councilman mccarthy councilman kevin do you wish to speak to this one um just briefly madame um i think we 're aware of um the um copper challenge one um the copper challenge is not going to be held or hasn 't been held in 2021 will not be held in 2012 because it 's normally uh general october period um so then the murray community asked for this money to be reallocated and as councils are probably aware there have been termites which is considered causing some angst i might just mention that they have organized for treatment to occur and i did speak to a structural engineer today who is trying to find someone small enough to be able to get in the hole and get under the floor to carry out this investigation because he said to me i 'm rather a large man and she asked me how much space there was and i did say that the whole floor had to come up as it had just been sanded and finished and everything else and we were hoping that would not be the case that the damage was limited but we had no idea at this stage i 'm more than happy to move this recommendation thank you so much do you wish to speak to this thank you any other comments for counsellors thank you page 65 council 's item 1309 2021 unor unordered financial statements there 's a recommendation in two parts the council accepts the 2020-21 unaudited financial statements in accordance with section 413 back at three the annual financial report is in accordance with made there under the australian accounting standards and professional pronouncements and the local government code of accounting practice and financial reporting presents fairly the council 's operating result and financial position for the year and accords with council 's accounting and other records two the council delegate the mayor deputy mayor general manager and the corporate services director to sign the 2021 financial statements when the audit office review has been received and there are no material changes required you will know councillors there is an addendum which you have been all given um attached to this um report item um and that is what we will be speaking to will be the addendum i will just ask the um acting um acting director to maybe speak first on this as to why this has become necessary all right thank you um councillors we present the unordered uh financial statements to you tonight um you 'll notice that we have issued an addendum to the original statements that does come about through the process of the eric and work with our external auditors in preparation of the statements you 're been recommended to us in the preparation of the documents in particularly two main adjustments one item one based around the treatment of impairment uh related appreciation um this change has been proposed by the auditors um with an element of being captured in a revaluation reserve of the roads uh the other adjustment that has been made is towards our water and sewer revaluation this uh has come about due to a revaluation that we were looking to undertake but this was out of the cycle of generally the industry so they have opted for us or suggested for us to take an indexation method on that evaluation in the preparation of the statements we have uh conducted that through a number of some assistance from a contract cfos based on some of the challenges we 've had with staffing during this time and we do have uh kushman puma online to has prepared the statements to answer any technical questions that you may have in summary the addendum the two main adjustments to impairment and revaluation have had a a reasonable impact on the uh net result the attention to is our net operating result has uh increased from 7.7 to 8.9 million our net operating results um before correct capital grants and contributions uh has gone from uh negative 1.2 to a 66 000 uh surplus so there 's some of the adjustments that have been noted and we put those forward for consideration uh to accept the unauthorized statements i have someone to move this recommendation please not only do i have a second replay council mccartney councilman do you wish to speak to the report i don 't think he met him there um i do have some questions um on what and i obviously i did send someone through um they had some answers at 12 o 'clock i just wanted to uh clarify uh some of the things one of the things is that we we have the 66 000 um surplus if we take out capital grants and the implications that has on employee costs and other other factors as i understand it so we we take out the capitalization of employee costs put that back and then we work out what 000 is only achieved because on the basis that our general fund had a 319 000 loss and is actually it 's made up and and and it 's negated by positive results in our sewer and water fund so our general non-sewer non-water actually if you take out capital grants actually didn 't make a loss about 319 000 i think so correct yes no so so that that situation could be slightly exacerbated if depreciation increases again next year that 's correct that is absolutely that is correct we may not be able to negate it with our sewer and water in fact our sewer fund could probably be in a bad position because the stp would probably be charged to it as a capital item would it for the super fund yes appreciation would appear on the surface that 's right but the new sports centre and the community hub would obviously come through into the general yeah okay i 'm just just over i think it 's important that we all appreciate this um i did have some problems with employee leave entitlements the various references on page 24 there is a reference to employ and leave the title that 's being positive 147 000. i 'm not quite sure yeah the reason that that is a positive is basically uh in terms of the budgeting that we 've allowed in that space has been um in a way over budgeted um and then there are references to restriction funds for lee in various places on page 34. there 's a reference to 881 000 for employee lead entitlements but in then in note c34 it is 551 000 granularly even i think it 's something like 747 for long service league i couldn 't quite understand the changes but maybe someone could explain this through the chair um basically the annual leave um certainly as provisions based on the fact that we don 't provision the entire there 's a percentage that we allocate to potential legal tournaments and um from what i understand with our cfo uh is that various from council to council we 're sitting at 64 but then our then it says in one of the notes later that we 've 's the one thank you um and it says we 've got long service left 755 current an annual lead of 522 superannuation 65 and then we 've got non-current um employee benefit provisions giving us a total figure of one four three two um yeah it 's over time sorry through the chair so you 're saying that 64 is that so that 's the 8.1 is 64 percent of that figure okay all right i understand that um so if i 'm i 'm right the ymca contract is costing us roughly 400 000 a year if we take the income which is 222 000. so right and it 's costing us 638 so we 're actually contributing for the management of that fitness and pool 400 000 out of our revenue each year it 's costing us about four hundred grand over four hundred dollars so everyone 's aware of that that 's what it 's costing us yeah it 's about 372. that 's right we also remember that that also includes employee costs running 360 odd days a year the the additional services and um couldn 't do so there 's there is a cost but that cost is also takes into consideration things that we don 't do [Music] it 's something we need to be aware of i 'm not saying the comment always was that you know a full pool is going to cost you somewhere within 300 400 000 a year when we looked at other examples but for this we 've got a pool and a journey both rough so much better so much patronage so much better it 's it 's yeah no i 'm not good yeah it 's beautiful yeah um and the only other thing one of those is on page 29 we talk about these building specialist roads and other structures and water supply network losses now i understand that 's the sale of assets where we 've actually lost because they 're still in their books at um this is specific examples i might show to kush if that 's okay hello everyone uh my name is through the chair i would like to respond on this one basically if you look at the to the scheduling c17 in c17 also these items are are displayed in carrying value of disposal column and specifically if you look at the roads called roads item when we are doing renewal in the roads we need to do the destructions of lot of load of parts of that specific roads and that specific amount is written down value of that item again there are other structure also when we construct those items we need new assets of those those structures when we construct those items we need to dispose of an uh a few items so that 's why there is a carrying amount of that specific same thing for building specialized also except plant and equipment uh we don 't have any any any any uh cash received for these items but yes for plant and equipment we dispose of and we got cash for other than that it just destruction of that item to to make the addition or renewal of those specific assets okay i understand then so what you 're saying is where we build a new road or replace the vfl run a capitalized new road then we obviously have to go to zero to be able to revalue the new value of the new roads that 's what i 'm saying and the same that 's how it 's okay i understand now um if i could go to e31 page 61 liabilities this defined benefit scheme continues to worry i 'm sure not only me but a lot of us the increase from 67 000 contribution la in 2021 it 's now an envisage that we 're going to a 15 jump to 77 000 i understand that that 's due to the um to the actuaries who are engaged by probably the state government on this fund but that 's a hell of that 's quite a big jump in a year 15 could have been much worse it 's a question of huge concern across many councils i mean where where will this end i mean it 's it 's um we 're ever going to get out of this if they have it they haven 't they haven 't done they have a landscape don 't have finished the fun finished in uh it was closed a new entrance yes yeah like some years some time ago yes that 's why i was asking the question i mean these things have a habit of i 've said lasting for a whole long time but as with the greatest perspective i say this is the greatest respect as people die off that amount should also reduce there 's two you know yes but but as as as the number of people in the fund reduces the amount we should be contributing should uh reduce so our actuaries um on the basis of average ages and everything should be able to tell us with some well these actually should be until some definitive a range of what is expected in the future well we anticipate the average age of females is the average age of males this but on that basis the numbers should reduce by this and they should also be give us an end date and it is it may not be definitive but they shouldn 't and they 're through i think one of the problems the gsc and so they found themselves well short and the the nickname of the fund is not the defined benefit it 's called the divine that has two elements one it stops when you die move on to the divine but while you 're alive it returns a divine income yes um and the state government 's got the same problem when they offer this as an incentive they have a huge unfunded liability in their books through public servants on exactly these types of things but they will not last the next question is g51 page 69. now i know the general management start with that that service ratio has changed again because it 's a result of the load however let 's leave that bit aside at the moment i think this debt service ratio should be 2.56 x not negative 2.56 x because you can 't have when you 're when you have an amount above the line it 's actually saying how many times can i service my debt so you can 't have a negative figure below in our situation so it should be we shouldn 't be we 're not meeting the benchmark i 'm first of all but we are above the line um through the chair we are meeting the benchmark all right so now we 're now with the three oh okay it 's an error that 's been acknowledged by the external auditor right and our number is around the nine nine points we are okay we are i mean i i 'd assume that with the extra borrowing and maybe not three million but as we increase our borrowing we may actually come under the benchmark so i wasn 't surprised to see 2.56 but i was i couldn 't i just couldn 't work out and it didn 't it 's it 's not how i would do it yeah anyway you know i 'm glad it 's been a big day it has been it made no sense to me while we 're on those benchmarks as you 'll find the only one that council does not meet this year is its own source revenue i 've never been more happy not to be the benchmark that i as i said i was interested to do and i know that we 're not doing it the exercise is not done if you 've we 've taken out the capital grants to work out where we 've been but if we actually got to the worst case scenario of actually taking out operating grounds to see where we 'd be that might be an interesting position i think that 'd be an interesting position for every council in new zealand new south wales yes yeah if i 'm picking up what you 're suggesting um i 'm happy with the restaurant madame asked my questions thank you i 'm quite happy to my proposal second i 'm proposing acceptance of these unordered financial statements that they now go to um that we accepted them and that we delegate the mayor deputy mayor and general manager and corporate services director these reports once and we 've got sleds by the property on the other side of the fish moving near the same plane any other comments on this one councillors councillor thank you [Music] [Music] just um just i was 75 74 for your information that debt servicing one with me away from looking at the operating performance ratio which general manager rocket points out he 's very happy to uh to um you 've been in the position um just for your information the rural average is for 407. own source operating revenue the rural average is 42. so um ours has been regularly uh above the 60 benchmark we 've dipped under because of grant funding this year just these are what the office of local government provides us to measure ourselves we get something i think we need to publicly point out the comparisons unrestricted ratio uh again our debt levels are absolutely terrific 5.6 but the rural average is actually 5.91 which indicates that there 's some tight money managers in the countryside that will appear debt servicing ratio um i like how we 're in fact nine rather than minus two point five six that two point five six made no sense to me whatsoever and i actually looked up the definition of how they calculate it and the the term that they result lists depreciation amortization um taxation all these things and of course it 's nowhere in our financial report i couldn 't find that number anyway so nine 's much better the range the rural number is 1.77 so we 're well ahead of that and the range across all councils is from 0 to 5786.2 rates are now standing desirable less than 10 we 're at 7.57 which is good the rural average is 9.65 so again we exceed the operation of similar councils cash expenses cover ratio needs to be greater than three we 're sitting at 29.43 the rural average is 14.02 so again we perform as good money managers compared to many other councils can we go back to that leave one what was the one i referenced you to action um 45 25 so that 's 45 or 74 yeah description of our movements and provisions down the bottom there even though we 're holding 64 of our obligations um and we mentioned leave liability every year um that is as i read it that we have in terms of annual leave a lower obligation and in terms of long service leave a lower obligation this period over the beginning right which is actually part of what we 've been trying to achieve to gradually bring down that that very big liability on our books again for people to observe um 16 of 74. d2 b21 rational charges notice the increase in ordinary rates for the residential is that only residential is that rural residential as well as residential through the chair i believe that is just residential but i might throw it to course just to clarify that one please uh that is including all residential but just a minute i will uh check again uh for for confirmation why do you have asked this question all residential is including rural residential course is that correct is that how you see it uh yes it 's all residentials including rural also you just know from 20 to 21 all residential rose um 127 000 farmland only rose forty nine thousand business nine thousand so i mean i 've always supported that um our rural residential which is our growth numerically rate payers where we our income with with considering equity as well but just for your information you can see that the residential the biggest increase in rate income was from the residential groupings both town and rural much 200 times higher than the next um 33 or 74 c13 [Music] 34 reserves restrictions four nine two i thought yeah the best part of a million bucks in there through the chair remember that you just used a component of it to supplement the independent living units is this some of that coming back um through the chair during this year that will be quite a substantial amount coming back through the sale of industrial movements occurring at the moment it 's not included in this figure there 's no transfers coming back there 's currently there 's money coming back from sales but i thought we shifted one way to bring back another and didn 't we take some for the colonel or was it the year before um yeah that was the year before that wasn 't even yeah that was twenty through the chair the only adjustment is council resolve to accommodation to to pay before they think [Music] that was allocated in that space but that was the only transfer that we 'll make okay thank you um just about done that thank you very much for your patience [Music] are there any other questions or comments around this report counseling i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor if all in favour harry thank you 14 11 quarterly budget review statements july to september 2021 the recommendation is report item 1411 is received as information can i have someone to move that way please tell us the people with helping people thank you councillor cable do you wish to speak to them thank you councillor mckinney do you wish to speak to this report no thinking about a marriage uh information only in this stage yeah thank you any other comments on this one counselor recommendation all in favor unanimously thank you thank you push thanks thank you everyone goodbye report general manager the recommendation is that the report item is received as information do i have a mover you 'll have an uber council thank you at work each day and what they want it 's a part of general management report because it 's an activity we need green state it used to be there and it 's frustrating to ring up and point out that the lady at the counter doesn 't know where they 're in and then we 'll find out how that person 's been away all day long just an action that needs to be actioned in in a part of the i take the news report and i have that it 's an opportunity that we shouldn 't mention that stars needs reinstatement people know what stars you could bring up people would say on the way for the day or whatever but now you ring up and yeah you 're not even on site and it 's just so frustrating when you 're trying to run thank you councilman mccarthy councillor downey you wish to speak to this one um just just in terms of recruitment we 'll have a number of uh poorly qualified people in mcconnell willing to take up the chief financial position if the i think position is still open i 'm through the chair the position is still available yes we haven 't been able to recruit from that position at this point we can 't work for six months so after being a counselor good idea um and um training um do we if we 've got staff undertaking financial training um you know tafe courses in business skills all sorts of nature and stuff what uh what allowances do we provide for them to do that um through the chair depending on what it is but we we offer um anything from paying for their for their fees their courses um offering study leave we offer incentives to do those sort of things so yes incentives out there available to staff to go down that path and most of those distance these days um [Music] through the chair are these through the chair there is a number of ways in which this can occur um if something covered 's provided for us is that that remote opportunity is one that that institutions are taking on board at a rapid rate of in those institutions you still need to sometimes go there of course i think it 's actually in-person training it 's always more effective and stimulating than distance electronics thank you report if i could just on the page 70 under the wh risk area um this records all injuries and sicknesses related to work the the register doesn 't it for october yep okay so whether they 're physical injuries or mental injuries they would be logged as a lost time injury or a stupid and if they 're on restricted duties that would be long as well depending on what it is but yeah generally right okay and on page 71 at the bottom if employees leave is that the date they lodge their resignation or is it the date that they actually depart um through the chance the day they depart today for the party okay thank you very much for questions thank you that 's why any other questions am i on on good i just uh watched the video clip uh on page 73 we 're talking about the business and tourism and great stuff 's more coming along with the free guides in partnership and i think that 's great stuff that matt 's doing there on his team thank you thank you councillor gibbons any other comments here on this one councillors with the recommendation all in favor gary thank you hey 77 councillors item 1402 monthly activity report planning and development the recommendation is that the report item is received with information could i have a mover please counseling counselor cable thank councilman kevin do to speak to this one i 'm thinking about a mayor i um i note um that the director of planning has provided us some some information in the power line to get to the waste facility and the costing of the potential of the weigh station um the negotiations with the owners of two properties over which the power line will have to pass has been relevantly successful i understand from what you 've stated here which is excellent news um i note on page 78 the js regulatory services who are the company that did the report on the ship obviously have suggested in relation tired loader do we have any costings at this stage or indicative costings as to what we might be looking at for one of those with a second hand i 'm assuming second hand on you with the chair no costumes at the stage the playing foreman is uh looking for costumes at the moment so with with the power and the one and we reasonably with the power we 're reasonably certain that the cost will um the construction crosser will be well roughly hundred thousand ninety six thousand um and the design six thousand two fifty so would have been a bit over a hundred thousand for the power design and construct is that correct through the chair the design is actually uh comes out of the ninety oh it comes out of it correct yes um okay so the 6250 is included within 96 to this year that 's correct so we 're looking at total costs of about 90 96 000 then okay and do we have any idea what the signal works will cost for the weigh bridge through the chair at this stage i wages that council would endorse um coming forward i 'd make an assumption it 's probably looking at a 20 percent civil rights cost okay so would we be doing that or would we be asking the way bridge provider to do that when we go after our to your request through the chairman technical service director too certainly certainly through the chair certainly something we would consider uh internally doing that with um resourcing machinery as part of that being who the successful award tender was to uh in negotiation and there might be underground plot power would be from the pole to the wave or what i don 't know how adjacent or it 's adjacent to the building is it through the chair there yeah because we have to we have to cost in taking the power from wherever it is to the way bridge as well i 'm assuming correct that 's probably an extra cost okay so could we when would we expect to have a more detailed costing of these overall overall total costing of these three elements we expect that by december or more suitable time or factory time also based on the uh negotiations with the landowners thurman timing going forward the power okay so the 96 000 includes all the issues with the land holders it 's not expected that we have to pay any money for land holders or anything else from easement through the chair there could be legal costs involved that may be required to set up during these yeah i suppose it 's on a resolution so i can 't go into the action items can you through the chair it does fall part of your short term actions from our from our from our foundation so there is they 're already in there but it didn 't say february um thank you madame i have um nothing more more other than to note there 's uh the number of cats and dogs empowerment will [Music] any other comments counselors yes just if we could go back to the waveridge group for a moment um js regulatory services they 've obviously employed as consultants to recommend the type configuration and capacity of this way bridge through the to assist in uh providing advice not to make recommendations how how we determined what configuration what size through the chair i think based on obviously having the mains power uh the waste facility first um and then the types of facilities their recommendation that would come back to council to with with uh supporting uh information to uh allow our decision to be made yeah basically i guess what i 'm asking you is that in ground or above ground station that could be moved if necessary if required in the future well i 'm saying we don 't_''_7910.88 so through the chair the way that the um js report indicated was it should be a movable structure from memory um and that gives the capacity to integrate that with the changes that you 're going to make to your tip over time so it would definitely need to be above ground well most definitely and then also what it does it gives you the capacity or the option to increase the capacity of it cheaply down the track if you want away larger vehicles we just need to that we 're waiting on the power to put it in but um bridge is operating a long way from power yeah that 's it a little bit we 've got a bit further to go yet but we need to we just need to have some more detail around these things before we go down the track thank you thank you daddy just got 77 [Music] thousands do you have any idea of the break up there i mean not precise so forgive me and i know springer but you know it 's a 28 registered hosted properties 19 non-posted properties and i 'm assuming does that is is a motel one of those is that a hosted property or is that a different classification yeah through the chair the hosted properties um sorry the registered ones would be your more traditional solid combination your hotels being beast where um a lot of the airbnb stays would fall into that non-registered and they are increasingly taking over the majority of the mix of accommodation that we have to offer in the in the region you do look at it 's part of that thousand that 's right and do we have um for you sir do we have many um uh you know regular because they now have to be registered so do we have much inquiry as through you do either director in much inquiry and continuing to establish registered airbnb facilities is it a growth area through the church certainly growth the if they 're not registered with the department of effect trading in the the uh the host or states are required to take them off their listing so they can 't then use those facilities going forward unless they 're registered and it 's continuing to grow and it is continuing to grow i 'm sure that will occasionally come aboard on the 1st of november and i think it will continue two or three months in the new year because i think upon that ground 's just unpractical especially for yeah anyway that 's one one problem um a bit concerned about this js regularly serviced with the um report last month about the uh kelly hammer at 250 to 300 thousand and i written on it and i 'll give damian approach i think this week i think it was 160 000 [Music] well as you see if you look around the um rtc actually got to tell you for their operations and i don 't know what they paid for that but anyway um on page 78 you come down the bottom there and we 've got a new shed 23 uh 10230 on the road and then we 've got a new shed the same number and then another one is operator waste service and the way service again so what what are we doing on a week filling the page into making work look busy or i don 't know all that happened last month matter me that we had a duplication what i 'm getting at is the idea of having this scale here so you could track and this is an indication of how busy the staff are right which is fine we just had a resignation and it 's going to put more pressure on that staff but what i meant i don 't mind getting a four five six seven eight eleven and then two of them for the duplication two is that correct through the chair the one nine five six right there were two two waste the onsite waste water systems applications there yeah two different systems so that 's why so it 's two that 's twice two different systems two different systems correct okay um the 1023 a corner road it 's the same so my apologies i 'll have to get that removed no no that 's fine i just want to give it up and as you can see the next two down the thing here new shed o 'connell road and the new shed lanes road new shed over on um 79 you can see where i 'm coming from to try and get these things exempt that hold they 're really only auxiliary buildings on obama land if they meet a required size thank you for the director 's report 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that the reporter 's received his information could i have another please tell us with council givens responsible given madam mayor um just in relation on the campbells river road i have a few concerns with regards to the design and the width and going to have an on-site discussion with the relevant people this week just to make sure i know it 's been a wet time but we just need to keep to the standards that were set in stage one of this road with our design and just a question for the engineer with regards on it it 's getting a bit dark here um on that first page where above the picture where it says that uh completed of gravel and stabilized pavement length of 1750 does that what are you stabilizing with for a start trish is that a concrete stabilizer or is it ash and some other type of thing through the chair it 's a a lime uh limestone uh fly ash blend so it 's not concrete so it 's uh it is a valuable product in terms of being able to rework it right so that 's that 's what we started with uh the contractor started with on the it 's the same sort of gear as that and then we 'll be changed halfway along that road through the chair it 's certainly as per the geotechnical report that we um originally set out as per royal boston right across the 21 kilometers of pavement as per the recommendation of the borehole test so here it is correct in terms of what we did start with the only change that did happen was with uh cement and fly ash near the the campbells river as the terrain did change a little bit and uh that was the recommendation of the geotech um of the only part of the project would you change that particular mix so do you get a more stable base with the cement do you there 's a stronger stronger pavement uh yeah through the chairs certainly like it is a stronger payment and it 's really subject to the uh the soil classification and conditions as to the design mix design mix that is used and going down into a wetter area that 's uh really the recommendations around that geotech report in that saying that can be continually work to get the humps and hollows and design out or is that 's usually when you leave it alone isn 't it when you get that done uh through the chair certainly with the wet weather um recognising their impacts but yes it does have an ability to to rework rework the payment prior to a bitumen spray still being applied to it so that 's relatively weird i suppose we 're pretty fortunate in that aspect okay i think that 's all i need to ask thank you council given councilman kevin um thinking about it um i was just certainly going to say a particularly thorough report that went through all the aspects of technical services is dealing with in quite some detail including substantial photographs uh it 's obviously as we 've all said a very busy time for technical services at the moment so there 's a number of projects at once it 's obviously taken considerable management time thank you any other comments from this one councillors council mccarthy yes um putting the council requests for countries as you pleasure we should now understand understand construction of the house when do we look like getting it and repaired and why did it fail um and i thought my council request form was the estimated cost of getting it repaired because it 's going to have to be ripped up and graveled and pipes put under it yeah so through the chair is that one on page 87 um there 's certainly further investigation going into that uh ground water is really the attributed causation of why it has failed no doubt about that um costings at this stage are being put together i 've had a number of contractors view that particular section of road top section of where it has failed and also again failed on some section of the uh former formation on humphreys lane so in recognizing that i am putting those costs together back to council what that looks like at this stage very hard to move as you can attest the 100 mils and then consecutive rainfall has made it very hard to bring any trucks or machinery in there which would mainly exacerbate waiting to build dwellings there and i also understand they are going to have difficulties moving inside their paddocks as as i am on trying to fix that road at the same time so i will bring a report back on what that looks like um yes we have had some setbacks no doubt about that so it 's really i 'm in the hands of what does fall out of the sky unfortunately but um ambitiously am anticipating on trying to finish that prior to the end page 90 counsellors 1404 monthly activity report corporate services recommendation is a report item is researchers information can i have a mover that way please counselor it 's good to see that changing around some of our licenses and other things has been able to um in our mobile phone plan has been able to save us overall about 25 000. that 's referenced on page 91 of the mobile phone review second item down and under office 365 license is about two thirds of the way down page 91._._8738.8 i will just say how i was very pleased to hear that certificates and as they i 've had a lot of feedback about that and they were extremely grateful for the patient shown by the library staff i 'd have to say any other no other comments counselor joanie um just two quick ones mad at me i did uh i noticed that myself actually doing something a number of people came i thought both of the workers in the library at that time were remarkably considerate really did an excellent excellent job um just the other one i and i don 't again drawing people 's attention it was actually in the annual report but i didn 't find that where i 've made that mark because i didn 't have any sticky pads but they 're talking about the open office and the microsoft machines and the office 365 and something like that the software cost in the in the annual report was just short of 400 000 dollars which is staggering i mean that 's not hardware i say this every annual report client that you know the computer companies i think develop you know they 're the up with a new software program that doesn 't to make sure it doesn 't mesh with anybody else 's so we buy another one [Music] four hundred thousand squid hardware was it was less than a hundred thousand annual events huge sums of money there 's also it also runs your complete governance framework so again it also runs your complete governance framework it 's staggering it 's a corporate theft at the moment through the chair it 's the value for money you get out of that that spin that is why we 're looking to change what we do thank you thank you council any other comments here councilworms it 's just a comment on the independent living area units um matt and myself were down there the other day having a look at it and they 've got a bit of a spray as the council was with him and matt took it on board very well that was a comment about the carpool it 's not been up and a few other things about the garbage bin and something that matt didn 't need it change things over and it takes a bit of time but you know he 'd make copper straight which was not called because first i 'm not gonna vote for him anyway locations across the avenue street when at this point weren 't we no so we 're getting a report on the position in the action plan okay is it in the actual thing okay i thought it was just agreed the other night to get a costume back but it 's meeting anyone that was in the briefing through the chair we indicated that chris is going to do it costing to put conduits under that yeah 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is that council support item 1405 is information please tell us for capable and the second council detection thank you councillor cable do you wish to speak to this one just very briefly madame please that 1.9 was real correct there was a few disbelievers here last time we 're laughing we would be if they were all at that [Music] 1406 grants monthly update a recommendation is that the report is received as information thank you councilman do you wish to speak to this one thank you madame obviously we we know about the 349 the thousand for stage two of their commonwealth ground um about the other parts those missing out for the sporting complex and the sewer treatment plan um interesting to see what the feedback is for those unsuccessful projects um on the bottom of page 101 obviously the number of grants um october covering a whole lot of things that we 've discussed previously and there are a lot quite a few grants pending 12 i think probably approximately that was submitted in june so i suppose um um that would be like to be like to be told in february on the basis of the time frame that 's been taken to the other grants can 't tell sorry counsellor in the hands of the government absolutely yes um but no everything is fine i 'm happy to um only to um mirror council on the kibben 's comments about the unsuccessful grants there which was uh disappointing um i noticed a comment we requested a feedback session and that um uh for the consultation session uh for a feedback session read the unsuccessful projects in one eye okay i thought there was um more optimistic when these things were when we originally found out that they were not we were unsuccessful but they invited us to um reapply for something in particular is that the case or is it just a grouping invitation um through the chair there 's this always much commentary around inviting people to reapply for funding it 's just those funding opportunities need to be open before you can reapply all right so i know i thought there was um particularly at the sap i thought there was a specific invitation that said you just need to fiddle a few things um through the chair we continue to seek opportunities in that space okay thanks thank you thank you council i know the comments here come to us sorry i made about to have a river charge it 's just i noticed on page 104 28 313 45 that 's was the end of spin that 's now going to be spent on over what the horseshoe shaped stone wall around the main over an entrance side and a coral road was going to tell that was part of the original signage diver report we got wasn 't it through the chair it was part of one of our ongoing projects that we would look at under the what did you call our tool kit yeah um that are required for the funding this one 's just been able to support that through the additional funds the other issue that you have to sort of sort of issues the other thing that yeah yeah yeah we 've already built buildings yeah um the consideration you have to make is that the money has to be distributed within the funding deed that you have for those projects i understood that yeah i understood that it was the only one that we had contingency to in fact progress and what were street sign blade decals yeah so as part of that we did a whole heap of rebranding of our street signs to put the more than you imagined logo on your street swords okay right a little bit confused here because the first paragraph that says the regional new south wales planning portal grant was due to be expended by 30th of june i understand then says this is the first paragraph in the file item five 104. to date council has used the ground to install new shelving now when i read that i thought that meant all funding but but then the next one says we 've still got thirty four thousand is that right yeah so we didn 't use it and when the projects we 'll be looking at is um to support the planning and development team in progressing the portal and doing things that would give the community their understanding on how to use the portal so it 's to make give our staff better training as well i 'm assuming because they 're having difficulties from what 's been mentioned previously um webinars and or all my staff are now we 've all signed up to those in myself and they 're happening sort of ad hockey over a few weeks so on all different sections of the said well second part of that assistance will help will help receive additional procedures um for internal and to help customers as well in the melodic spend the 34 000. we 're not spent not paying the department of planning to for them lectures on how to use their own portal that 's correct they 're free sorry through the check um so we really expend the total thirty four thousand or we have some other ideas for it through the chair the aim would be to spin it so we don 't have to give it back i suppose um but if we 're not expending on the assistance will look at the other means i mean if people are having difficulty is it worth putting something in well i supposed to have a community hub yet or community hub or something where people can actually go and submit their applications online there i don 't know we we encourage that through the wild regard thank you councillor any other comments he comes with just his portal sandstone bluff it 's not set up for out here because the of trouble with that variety of things that happen in the bush the portal just doesn 't accept it forget what i mean yeah i knew there 's teething problems telling our local member that he 's implemented something that uh is only in favor for over there now the comments i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor page 105 1407 water and sewer plant report recommendation is if the report is received as information can i have a movement please councillor mckechnie although kellum thank you council mckechnie with respect to this report just briefly about it pleasing to see the damn running over um but the other pleasing note is the graph on page 105 shows in the figures above our usage um shows our usages remain pretty static um they 've been a rather wet time so that that indicates that our water users are still continuing their uh good practices so i think they should be commended on them more often um not directly on this report maybe i think it 's an opportunity to just mention i was at a workshop today water in this region um engineers uh which i found a bit difficult because um i was the only person no no i was the only elected representative so it was it was an engineering viewpoint rather than a community but at least dpi is thinking about it i think a long way to go to understand what strategic planning means hopefully at least at least we 're talking to them and at least they 're listening the other comments were putting recommendation all in favor gary thank you page 107 tells us 1498 monthly update status of council resolution the recommendation is that the report item is received as information could i have a movement please and it seems to reflect the progress of most of the issues some of the issues that are in here obviously which we 'll have to consider later in these papers cctv audit and review the recommendation is that council note the report item 1409 for information can i have a mover please council capital councilman kevin thank you that 's okay would you wish to speak to this one thank you councilman to say madame we obviously have a dilemma about this ccp audit review although we 're noting in this report it seems to me that in some stage in the near future we 're going to have to take some actions in relation to what we do with this and we 'll probably have to get some positive a as to what the most cost effective what is most cost effective to do um in this day and age i 'm not sure that it 's tenable to remove the cctv cameras due to security risks and other issues um although we are a small town um towns and cities are putting security in cctv down their main streets and other main thoroughfares rather than taking them out but obviously what what this report highlights is that we have to what we have to look at is what we can do economically what 's obviously practicable but it 's not practical to have people go up ladders to try and recover recordings etc and i know we do have existing cctv in in our existing facilities and outdoor um and installed for so long so obviously we 've got some left we can learn some lessons from those to what we 've done there maybe um but to not have cctv is probably not an option so we normally need a really positive recommendation i 'm not sure when it 's in digits this was coming back is it sort of early next year march february um with a positive recommendation because and it cost him because um obviously what we 've got is not not filling the bill through the chair and that 's exactly what the report says we 're going to look at all these options we 'll cost them and bring them back against consideration thank you councilman any other comments on this one counselor now on this cable uh camera 8 table will unfolded through the chair i 'm not exactly sure the time but i 've it 's a reasonable amount of time from what i understand ridiculous one camera causes problems i just thought that the previous requirement of the director when it was selling that staff connect if all the cameras weren that was all and the director was going to check him every friday how long it 's been then the previous director 's no longer here i realized that question but we 've got the report now and whether there will be a review and it will come back to council as matter said with costings and options i think all we can do now is move forward um my comment would be that um having having that within the report doesn 't say that the cameras are out like we have all our cameras operational except for this one apparently yeah um i don 't want where cam is because that may [Music] that 's what we 're doing here thank you councilman any other comments in this one councilwork for the recommendation all in favor thank page 119 1410 community hub update there 's a recommendation there that council received the report item as information can i have a move of glasses [Music] costs so in total we 're looking at somewhere between 140 or 150 000 are we for without costs but reasonable if i add the is covered by the comment at the base of 119 in the table and then we talk about active equipment five to ten thousand so i 've used ten thousand there so we 're looking at sort of um 144 000 roughly contingency let 's say 150 000 so that 's going to so we need to find 150k somewhere for fit out is that correct that 's correct right so we the next council should be made aware that that has to be when when when 's the estimated completion date for the hub through the chair it 's august september september 22 so then in 22-23 they 'll have to find 150 k for fiddler or before i take you for him yeah i think [Music] through the state library that we will appreciate we do get this this money yes annually uh which will be applied to the divide so maybe for the next council we could get recommendations suggested um that could be noted uh the operating cost of just trying to do a bit of a obviously the cleaning which is window cleaning sorry on building is in planning phase it 's talking about ground levels probably included in existing but external higher roof windows will incur additional costs don 't have an indication of that um but we 're looking at at least 18 000 more from what i can see for utilities we 're probably looking at another 7 000 cleaning we 're looking at 8 000 maintenance including air conditioning this is marginally more expensive so it 's 2558 now do we allow another 500. um that 's bringing us at 15 and a half thousand and we don 't know what the window cleaning is going to be um in the issue of the garden maintenance will be the same so it could be probably 20 000 that 's probably the upper end of the additional through life costs i 'm hearing that the staffing is going to be equivalent full-time equipment because that 's the staffing unless council in the future resolve to do something else because they have an impact on that yeah and we don 't know what the end we 're assuming the new building is going 't actually know what it works right now so what so any idea of what we should budget before carrying forward as a through life cost additional amount per year that we 'll need to do this through the chair circle 20k yeah okay and just sort of comment just that the other element of this is that we 're doing this is a higher use of venue fee generation through a more you know a new facility more deep space that 's an element that we know um a pretty damn good amenity which brings us into the 21st century and uh there 's an expectation that that comes with some costs and i think that is a reasonable cost a substantial recommendations nine counsellors item 15 there is no urgent business this evening page 1

reasonable period of time this is the only opportunity for a community member to address council during an ordinary council meeting this evening we have o 'connell boss walker from the oberon youth council who wishes to address council on an item in the um on the agenda the lighting of the footpath thank you [Music] i 've been asked by the youth council to provide some more information about the lighting that was brought up for the footpath in between the christian life center and the public school basically we requested this lighting because we run an after-school program at the church there and especially in winter when it 's dark after about 5 pm we have kids walking home down that pathway and not being well lit that 's a danger for the kids walking down there and we do um yeah we would like to hopefully get that lead if possible for the safety of the kids as well as just general people in the community using that football so that 's pretty much all for me this evening would you like to come to the election thank you could you state your name please i 'm shane ryan um i own a property adjacent to the uh development application for the function centre on the marriage road and um yeah we owned a plan across the road three five millimeter drag which we will be one of the most effective places to the function centre and um this has been brought to my attention by understanding that use of these premises as a wedding center is achieved under the current zoning act therefore council should not have proven um the roads um in the business for tonight 's meeting i never seen um really no mention of madol road it 's all the meadows road which council doesn 't want the job doing the most of that but there 's still a small area there that um with buses and stuff going to win venues which is uh still narrow road and the other one is the noise we 're 15 k 's from a quite rural uh area mostly uh farming and that 's bizarre park camping ground within 75 metres of our family home and there are 15 to 20 residents i think on the council papers said 17 residents that will be affected by it but the traffic use would be large greater with the people living further down the road down drew 's road down mallard road will be affected by the buildup with more traffic and the car park in this thing is overlooking my family home so any lights noise would say a very short distance to our family home that my father lives in and some clarification on a number of functions the same 20 weddings per year and 32 horse vents the operating hours and it tells it further down they can have 50 people at non-function events throughout the year and who is responsible for policing um the noise the amount of events they have um the operating hours but they just feel the concerns that i 've developed before tonight thank you thank you thank you [Music] are there any other questions from the public this week [Music] i 'm here um um so that i it is a substantial agricultural enterprise that has been in operations for over 12 years excluding moldara lawn not pastoral has widespread farming operations in queensland and the river arena aldara also waldarae is also considered an important part of the wonder caster operation deriving its income from two equally important parts there is a significant ongoing cattle grazing operation plus the wedding business has been operating for five years and enhances the farming income it is an important contribution to the economic viability of ordara it employs two full-time staff and five casuals it contributes significantly to the overall shy in terms of business and employment to the many businesses that benefit from the world star operation in response to the points raised in the council report which is on page 21 we 'd like to add the following comments point a we have a full-time venue manager who is local and we have employees on site and on call 24 hours a day seven days a week our venue manager is always present for functions and we employ local casuals for each event to support the venue manager have read the letters of objections from neighbours and we have listened to their feedback we 're constantly implementing numerous operational changes and fine-tuning our operation these are outlining our report to council and we by having staff always on site are confident confident that we are able to mitigate potential adverse impacts we also work closely with oberon police and we note that they had no comment when asked by council as we believe they are comfortable with the security and management of waldara we are also very sensitive to any issues raised by our neighbours and this forms part of our constant improvement processes b as mentioned the management team is constantly meeting and reviewing all policies and procedures we believe current and future measures support our expansion and mitigate any potential adverse impacts of our development noise and security are well managed and we have not been made aware that our measures have have been unsuccessful if further suggestions are received we 're happy to consider them and accommodate any reasonable requests c as mentioned border has a full-time venue manager and staff to assist them this are continuously on site during the entire wedding we assess the potential impact of each function and ensure staff is appropriate for the size of the function our staff are employed to protect the property our guests and to ensure security and those levels are not breached we also have a strict responsible service of alcohol policy legally guiding on our guests which is strictly enforced we believe our well-trained staff are first and best mitigation against any noise or security issues however if council believes cctv would also provide additional benefits we 're happy to consider it we also consider additional plant or noise buffering regarding waste management always is professionally removed and managed by local third party overall businesses during office hours providing financial benefits to the local business community we can also assess potential post wedding cleanup noise and rearrange our management plan to mitigate this aspect d could council provide us with appropriate measures or provide clarity around this corner we have implemented numerous measures outlining our report to warrant our expansion and relate their appropriate e we do not understand the relevance of this three any other questions good evening councillors i 'm sue webb we live at 200 molly road this is in relation to shane and the uh d.a at meadows roads function center just a few extra on top of shane that are a little concerning um licensing is there like waldara has to do is there any licensing within that function proposed function center the road the meadows road is very narrow and i do realize that you have a seven metre on condition for waldara and borough 's crossing road so i doubt even if meadows road is currently that or even close to it from where forestry had finished doing from ben and forest down as a truck driver myself it is very narrow even in our four-wheel drive if someone comes against you you have to get off the road mount olive road um is there a way if this goes forward that there could be a suggestion that mount olive road is not used for the traffic coming from taranah bathurst or wherever very narrow quite a dangerous road especially those sharp pinches if you 're not i can see a lot of issues it 's worse than meadows hopefully when council gets a chance to do it up we can address it um as a horse person when we go to horse events that are you know i respect and i think it 'd be great if he is a horse trainer um we turn up in our truck we 're self-contained very rarely will we come into a town we use if people are there selling uh out of there we use like if you you know you can see or whatever we always do that so i doubt that it actually going to bring much to town the question i 'm really asking is the function center they say 20 weddings for 120 people in that shed um fair enough they then say there 's going to be up to 52 events which is i gather what they 're thinking of he does his horse training during the day and they might go back to the shed at night my concern is is that shared the function center shall we call it operational hours and then on a sunday it 's back to eight pm so if there 's another 32 events and there 's an event a four day training event that he may have is that one event or is that four or 32 so you know when you look at it that way otherwise we could we could have it 52 weeks a year in use noise and as shane said that traffic out there is really bothering me because we don 't hear noise and and to hear people up to 50 people can be a lot of noise in a shed at night and that 's what their non-wedding functions is proposing so just a few things that i think a lot of locals are concerned about um i know that a local that 's down the meadow side of their gateway is extremely concerned of the access in and out of their property and things like that there is a bus route it does stop at the mount olive road but there is a bus route out to there so they 're just a few things that um and especially operation hours of the non functions and the horse horse you know that sort of thing and i i think the camping site i would i would imagine in there sorry sorry thank you very much are there any other questions from the public receiving or comments thank you very much yeah we now have a viewer on the basis that the gallery was full with applicants who had an interest in this we 've allowed for written submissions from those who couldn 't meet the the um the ability to um come into the council chambers tonight i 'm happy to just read those out of council didn 't excuse me that race there are three um the first one relates to the d8 report number 1301 which is the modification to the function center good evening madam mayor councillors general manager and all attendees of the meeting thank you for the opportunity to provide a statement to be read out in meetings i 've read closely the report for decision in sections through 1301 for development application 1015 832 modification to the function center and i it 's recommended recommendations i now wish to draw your attention to the notice of the termination of the development application dated 17 may 2016 for the original da-1015831 in particular to the period of operation of the function center in the consent given by council the relevant dates therein are as follows date of determination 17 may 2016 consent to operate from 17 may 16 consent to lapse on 17 may 2021 consent period has now lapsed and that 's regards from a doctor collate and the second one the second letter is relating from glenn and michelle armstrong relating to d813 uh the report 1301 the mayor and councillors with the owners of 299 mcewens creek road which adjoins the land in the subject of the present application the proposed modification to the applicant 's existing operations will directly affect our family 's lifestyle we are the closest home to the function area with approximately 300 meters away to the sierra we restate our objections made in our submission line to the current application and previous reference to complaints relating to noise security and disruptions caused by a functions held at waldara weddings in particular meets the definition of offensive noise allowing water amounts to be a 44 increase in functions we face the interference to our comfort on an almost weekly basis over the course of a calendar year it is unreasonable to ask us to just accept the frequent and regular interference with our enjoyment of peace and quiet from our rural setting we enjoy on a typical function night we can hear all manner of noise emanating from waldara it is not pleasant it is a mix of people talking and sharing amplified music and speeches towards the end of the evening there is noise of buses and vehicles and noise of staff clean up including smashing glass which we which we presume is being disposed of this accumulative effect when heard from a short distance of our house becomes intermixed unpleasant and destructive in short because of its nature character and quality the noise associated with a typical function interferes with the comfort and repose of our family the kind of knowledge referred to above disrupts our entire evening from late afternoon through to and quiet of the of the weekend evening we 'd also like to take the opportunity to highlight that the functions centre has now held events during public holidays namely easter 2021. we believe holding events during public holiday weekends is against the current application conditions the level of noise during this event impacted us to the point where we made complaints to the police the fact that the operators ignore these conditions concerns us of their intentions to hear any noise attenuation measures as indicated in the response to submissions and counsel nor do we normal nor do we doubt it would be effective anymore additionally we are not aware of any procedures to make complaints to the operators nor have we received any contact deals tonight notify the function center about noise and disruptions as mentioned in the application regarding complaint handling thank you for listening oh sorry glenn and sheryl armstrong um the third letter is from julian anthony alvarez and relates to report 1304 dear councillors in reference to da 19 2019 92 for the extended operating hours of the lake oberon function center and the the following reasons for council 's consideration for not providing such a report one there were no submissions received from our adjoining landowners for the proposed extension of the operating outs despite several submissions received from the initial deal it seems quite clear that our adjoining landowners are comfortable in the current operation of our function center and more importantly do not envisage any negative impact resulting from any extension of our weekday operating hours two when council granted the original approval for the function center it was satisfied that the site could operate without generating offensive noise zero use of external sound implications and as such there was never a condition or requirement to provide an acoustic report for such consent three lake over on a state function center along with its tourism operations has successfully hosted a number of large and small functions without any concerns or complaints raised from adjoining over owners and four the closest neighbouring residents to the function center is over 400 miles away also we understand why some circumstances and acoustic reports may be required for new developments and or existing developments that can slash concerns that have been raised by landowners we believe that in our case based on the above points raised it would not be justifiable to spend the thousands of dollars needed on a report that will more than likely yield a positive result lastly the current covered climate has made a very difficult business conditions through lockdowns and restrictions in functions numbers slash guests and it would appear that future restrictions of some kind will continue to impact into the near future whilst we believe that midweek functions may not be as popular as weekend events at this stage every little bit of help helps as a family owned and managed business we are very mindful of patrons and noise management our operational plan of management and the site of the site ensures all potential risks are assessed and managed such as acoustic levels patron management and emergency management ect since our residence is located approximately 200 metres from the function center is also our personal interest to ensure noise management is maintained we hope council understands our position and favorably considers our development application to extend our a time for questions counseling well we can address anything within the these are these none of these have been questions they 've all been presentations i haven 't heard a question asked right so i take them as a no they 're not presentations i take them as presentations because they can 't be questions about that they are not they are not presentations presentations counselors item six this is item seven questions the issues have been raised and will be addressed within the report thank you council councillors item eight six confirmation minutes before i put this recommendation i will just uh acknowledge three typo errors within your attachments and they have now been picked up and will be fixed up within the advertising units there 's a recommendation their counselors that the minutes of the ordinary meeting on the field on the

offsets calculator for new south wales projects such as information has been forwarded to jenny bennett and no a letter hasn 't_''_1634.64 been sent to matt clean there was no there was no direction for that to be done um as part of jenny 's presentation we 've had no discussion on it we don 't know the position of council yet and happy to do that when that 's made apparent this will be addressed through the jr at this point in time okay any other visions arising from the ordinary minutes counsellors putting recommendation all in favor harry thank you there 's a recommendation there

manager of the correctional center has now come back and said that they will supply this they will do this job themselves they don 't want to impost on the community in any way so that matters now

council mccarthy do you wish to speak to this report them there was boris crossing and the public interest to the road up near on booty shed it 's only 4.2 millions more and they don 't agree with that um yeah and they could have made one contribution prior to covert or i know code it 's changed a lot of things but um they 've still been functioning but i acknowledge that it brings a lot of money into the town but you put conditions there to allow the development to proceed and in that case with virus crossing they haven 't can conform with it therefore i can 't_''_2285.76 say that we can justify looking at a modification until all the original consents are adhered to thank you thank you my concerns are similar to council mccarthy um madame mayor um we 've had a presentation which i 'd call a presentation on the question tonight um from walmart but again it wasn 't addressed why burroughs road was not upgraded as agreed to contracted to by waldara as the subject of the previous da and it wasn 't addressed as to why they 're seeking directly a modification of the first things that the presenter or questioner would have raised when they stood up in here um and i agree with all the other points that are listed here um a to e um we 've obviously heard issues from neighbours as one of them being read out by the general manager tonight so at this stage i 'm not happy that this da be approved and i 'm happy to second the recommendation will be refused on the basis of aag listed in one and two thank you thank you [Music] i do note that the person who spoke earlier did mention that there is now an on-site manager for every event and that is a reasonable action to take as a as a manager or as an owner of a venue so it has taken time but that does not uh impinge my view that uh we should refuse this in favor of the recommendation madam mayor we we 're not um uh talking about uh changing the number of events uh that are currently killed there we 're talking about an intensification of the of to 50 and the time uh the times that those events have been held i think that um for a number of reasons that are there particularly the right of carriageway through through uh private land and and the quality of um paris crossing road um don 't lend themselves to any intensification whatsoever of that business i 'm afraid i 'm in favor of the recommendation thank you councilman any other comment thank you um i think the just by the way the business papers we have before us today where we have modifications to two and the proposal of a third function center is a challenge for our ru1 zonings where these businesses are allowed to apply to open and function because of the impact they have on surrounding landowners and because of that i think we have to be fairly stringent in the consistency of approach so i think we need to apply um similar restrictions or similar requirements to each of these operations as they exist i think that 's relevant later on when we talk about noise monitoring and it 's relevant when we talk proposal by this business before which council knocked back because they felt its impact upon neighbours would be too great so i do think we need to treat carefully um i think we need to [Music] be thankful that this is coming to town but i or providing economic activity in town but i do think we need to be careful in listening to neighbours and also in meeting the clients placed on the business i support the recommendation as well for several reasons but the two that stand out are the original conditions of the condition of the original da have not been met in regards to the upgrade of the road which is a probably a significant thing i think and there have been several complaints over a reasonable length of time from landowners and neighbors out there so i 'd like to see i think i 've proven in that before i 'll be supporting any modification to the existing d.a thank you councilman other comments counsellors council of gibbons we need to unmute your council of gibbons you got me yeah thank you yeah now the crossing i think that should have been completed in good faith and that should have been honored and maybe talk about progress after that but the upgrade of the raid needs to be achieved before we can move forward thanks thank you councillor any other comments councillors i 'm putting the recommendation in parts one and two all in favor carried unanimously thank you question 1302 page 35 councillors development application 1020 temporary storage shed shipping container the recommendation there should read one and two not three and four councillors the recommendation is that council berry control d4.1 building setback of the oberon development control plan 2001 to allow a reduced setback of the proposed temporary storage shed bracket shipping container 2. but a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993 can i have someone to move this place councilman technically thank you councilman did you wish to speak to me yes brother um this is i support this recommendation it 's only a temporary measure for the time being the storage shed um the business has undergone viewing and changes recently and we 've probably all been in there and noticed just the shop 's been modernised and really fitted i think it 's uh part of our duty to assist any business in the main street that wants to improve and expand so i 've no problem recommending the recommendation thank you councilman councilman kevin thank you mr mayor look i can 't add anything to what uh councilman has said he 's uh senate uh very irredirectly and um i fully support what he said thank you any other comments on this one councillors thank you madam now i think this um the way this business has been changed in recent years an exemplar for our businesses in town and they um their employment practices and their activities outside their direct commercial interests interest to be commended i think they 're doing a very good job i 'm happy to facilitate their operation any other comments councillors putting the recommendation all in favor did you know thank you item 1303 council page 40 develop an application 1 zero two zero two one five seven one garage the recommendation is the development control plan 2001 to allow additional floor space for the proposed garage two but a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993 can i have a mover please councilman kevin thank you council helen thank you councilman cuban do you wish to speak um thank you man look i i do know this property and i am i 'm also very happy that council staff did arrange a survey because there 's always confusion that appears in mount david as to where survey lines go no one seems to know little undefeated who live there quite often so i 've had to i know that the um former director of planning myself had some considerable issues with our survey lines in uh in mount david and i 'm sure it might be an issue for the new planning director um we 're not certain now sorry um now look i 'm happy to um to to move this recommendation i know the house is concerned i know where the garage is i 'm happy to move this one thank you there 's two zero one nine nine two and 90 hours of operation there is a recommendation of their counselors that i need to add to before i ask for a mover i 've been advised that the reason for the refusal or acceptance of any notification or da has to be listed within the recommendation so the reasons that are listed in the body of your report will now be moved up to be contained in the recommendation so the recommendation is but council refused modification development application 102019 as additional planning as additional information has not been provided for assessment under section 4.15 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979. the proposed modifications are not considered environmental impacts relating to potential noise therefore not satisfying the requirements of section 4.55 bracket 3 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 b the proposed modifications are not considered satisfactory in terms of the matters identified in section 4.15 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 2. that a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993 so that is the recommendation that i for joining me thank you i had a second chance okay thank you how 's it going um worth moving something so you can take them out um before i speak just clarification um the officer if necessary in the summary um i noticed the [Music] modification asking for sunday to thursday eight am to midnight operating hours is there do we have a standard i notice in other examples there is a 10 pm do we have a standard or a consistent approach to those hours during the the week matter meant the penny directly um in the next month next year thank you madam mayor um i i do appreciate that the people running this business um uh appear to have done a very good job they are they 're not they 're running it in in in concert with their neighbours there were no complaints no submissions um the newest residents 400 meters away uh and that they um they 're doing quite a good job but i think as i 've already said tonight i think we need consistency in these businesses this type of business job with their current neighbours both of those things have changed it 's not satisfactory to just say well everybody 's all right with it at the moment therefore we don 't need to meet requirements because everybody will change at some stage in the future and there could be a totally different perspective so i think for our own consistency that we do need to request this additional acoustic report that we don 't have i appreciate the financial impulse but i also know that airbnb and these types of businesses are getting absolutely flooded with pent up demand so the circumstances have changed for them so i support the recommendation to apply a common standard across these types of businesses that are there and request an acoustic report that all conditions be met thank you councillor all right thank you madam mayor i agree with what counselor daniel said what we 're talking about here is um going by the rules the rules are that a um a report is needed um they 've had plenty of opportunities they 've been given extensions of time we 're waiting the report is needed they have decided for summary whatever their own reasons are that they don 't want to do it i think when the time comes they might change their mind and they will the system can proceed then they are doing a good job out there it 's a pleasant place to go but we all have to live by the rules and the rules are that there 's a requirement for a report so they need to abide by that to progress the job thank you councillor councilman kevin thank you very much can i propose an amendment please um look i have given a um part of it to the uh executive assistant but i have um have modified it as a result of you modifying slightly the initial recommendation um it would read something like this council approved modification to develop an application 10.2019.9 subject to the following occurring the applicant obtaining an acoustic report in order that council can satisfy their requirements to satisfy the requirements under section 4.15 of the environmental assessment act racket act in relation to the impacts of noise mentioned be obtained by 31st of march 2022. semicolon c the acoustic report satisfies council staff with the increased hours requested in the development application 1022019.9.2 will not cause noise issues it will not cause noise issues that would not allow under section 4.1.5 of the act d council advises the proponent of the council 's decision in relation to section 415 of the act and e the hours of operation applying will be 8 am to 7 pm monday to thursday and 8 8 a.m to 12 p.m friday to saturday until all the conditions in one a to d inclusive are satisfied and two if any of the conditions in recommendation in resolution one are not satisfied the conditional approval for the development application 10.2019.9.2 terminates i 'm sure that 's complicated madam mayor but the nature of this and you need a point three at a division and a division be called sorry yeah yes thank you i would due to the length of that amendment i would ask before i call for a second or that the amendment can probably [Music] yeah i just want to 're looking at before i call for a second and we have some discussion and some input from the staff have the conversation before okay let 's have it on screen because i couldn 't follow [Music] we 're waiting for sharon i 'll ask for a comment yeah so thank you madam mayor and before i hand across to the planners i 'll sort of give a bit of an overview the problem you 've got with that recommendation is that you already have a development consent and this is a multiplication to do that consent placing additional conditions on the modification before they can go back to doing what they can currently do now has some implications i would suggest that should council want to see an acoustic report included a smoother or certainly a clearer option would be to simply defer it ask the ask the owners to say you need an acoustic report outlining the the concerns of the race prior to us being in a position to progress the matter it 's as easy as that like you can you can really wrap it up modifications until an acoustic report has been supplied and staff are satisfied the report addresses potential noise issues like if that was the case given what currently has been launched as part of modification council staff can then determine the application on a merit space because it hasn 't required any other um trigger for it to be presented to cancel we don 't want this thing to go on forever though it needs a date cutoff date has to be provided by a certain date um but to be honest with you councillor if it wasn 't provided by a certain date i would suspect more planning staff would be putting a report back saying we asked this they haven 't supplied it so we 're recommending refusal and you can go from me but i 'm suggesting the resolution have a date so that if they don 't provide it by a certain date then it 's quite easy for planning stuff if you if you want to put a date on it 's totally up to you but there 's just some issues when you start tagging that supported by the applicant before you can progress the matter and the applicant 's not in a support okay [Music] the um as general manager mentioned we do need the applicant 's consent to add conditions that um we 're having above the resistance okay counselors counseling keepers move the member that you can see on the screen do i have a second internet admin sorry my script 's not working i 'm sorry i can 't sit on the screen i can 't see it either can you hear me and thank you counselor thank you i can see you now but i can 't see the amendment okay sharon 's working on that thank you got it um i think in c it should say the acoustic report confirms that the increased hours of operation and council advisors the environmental assessment the hours of operation the council advises that i think of the act is unnecessary indeed indeed i think take the words of the act out or just cancel guys the proponent of the of the result through the chair the council is obligated to let ask general manager as that reads now does that constitute a legal recommendation that this council could put i think through the chair i 've already indicated that that 's not the case this is a modification of an existing approval the hours of operation already applied to the existing da as it sits now which is a legitimate consent in its own right i 'm prepared to amend it okay council given i prefer to make the recommendation as per the general manager 's recommendation that councils defer approval of development application in 2092 until an acoustic report is provided that satisfies section 4.15 of the environmental assessment act two such acoustic report must be obtained by 31st of march 2022 otherwise the modification shall lapse correct or terminate so so don 't defer the approval we can just defer the modification to the application so you can 't defer saying at the acoustic book and a division be called is that legally in management approval of the modification for approval of the modification just defer the modification because we 've got the current application in front of us 31st of march 2022 happy with that counselors can everybody see that amendment proposed amendment i 'm now looking for a second one councillor callum thank you thank you madame i 'm quite happy with that there 's an amendment i have a couple of observations to make the first council i have a mover and i have the second of the amendment council mcgivern do you wish to speak to this amendment thank you madame um well as has been said before this business has operated for some time and but as a matter of consistency and i think this was said by councillor dhoni before we need to ensure we have consistency across our development applications and we do have a requirement under section 4.1.15 to look at the impact of noise and this is an increase in the num increase in the hours of operation um in further into the night and that require an as this um this function center is on a lake uh on the dam dam it is highly likely as with coal and water that there is an amplification of sound from people in the town in the town of overall so i think it 's we have to be highly uh very aware of this and obviously we 're extending the hours during weekdays and during most weekdays and sunday so we 're also we have to bear in mind we are extending it on sunday which is noise pollution laws obviously see sunday is meant to be a quieter day and we 're asking here for extension on a sunday as well so i think it 's crucial we have an acoustic report um i 've heard what the proponent has said um by way of operator through the general manager tonight and i have seen what they have said in this report but i think it 's crucial we have an acoustic report in relation to this counselor thank you heard tonight several times because we 've talked about consistency across the variety of locations um and i think this is an example where that consistency is probably counterproductive das needs to be assessed based upon the environment that the undertaking is taking place so for example you know to have a single set of rules about what times something can be used uh is productive when there are circumstances that allow more latitude and that 's what we 're here to provide answers to is the latitude that as a council we 're happy with i agree very much with uh councilman kevin 's view of the um acoustic uh report because we need to have a baseline of what the acoustic effect on the surrounding areas are now i don 't know why that wasn 't done in the original va but it 's important that for future use [Music] for any future changes in the in the uh development application consent that we have that baseline and we need to establish that now and i think once we 've got that we can actually make a sensible decision on whether we will commit the hours to be extended to uh am to midnight seven days a week thank you councilman any other comments on this one councillors please counselor kate i 'd like to speak against the amendment please maybe yeah basically because we 've spent amendment that really does anything except put a date in it i think that we should uh stick to the the the recommendation the original recommendation that leaves it up to the applicant to um get a uh an acoustic report and if they wish to proceed with it if they don 't they won 't um it doesn 't matter if it 's march or this time next year that i don 't think that will change anything i might be i might be um pointed out to be wrong but i don 't think i think it 's up to the applicant to decide if he wants to do to proceed with the with the with the [Music] what we 're doing is putting a date on there so that if he comes back in may next year and once with a with a an acoustic report and then and the modification application we will have to say no sorry you missed the time frame i think we spent a lot of time not changing the motion um in that major way thank [Music] um i 've got council don 't come here sorry made america a bit lost in consistency and not consistency if we should apply to the individual circumstances then and then we need an acoustic report to judge those in individual circumstances then the acoustic report is the common standard that we 're applying secondly i would like the council to refer at some stage in the future to consider in this one bringing the weekday hours down i would like to see weekday hours you know we 're talking about major operations in the r1 zone we do need to take that into consideration so i i just for council 's memory when this comes around again i would argue that the sunday to thursday time is is reduced till or actually it 's eight o 'clock on a sunday i think 10 o 'clock on weekdays that 's just for future reference thank you very much any other comments on this one councillors councillor how 's it given he hasn 't done you have to unmute the council given this place yeah it didn 't raise my hand sorry okay i 'm that councillor capel uh has indicated and as a comment i do not on page 49 there is currently no limit on the number of events that can be held per year at this venue i think with extended hours um that opens up i can open up the number events and that may generate more noise so i do think that 's doubly important that we have a um we actually have a a noise report and i think the recommendation cut quite covers that as it stands any other comment before i put the recommendation in this statement they say that management lives on site that 's not a big plus to any any venue yeah it certainly is so yeah i think we just stick with the original um i could be wrong you can do your own acoustic report can 't you i would have to go to the chamber are you sure because i was involved with the sawmill over again and hit the scene and shower at the time and they done their own acoustic thought and proved that the birds were the noisiest higher the gear this the um sophisticated equipment that acoustic consultants use these days would require a certain consultant report that 's my life yes i 'm sorry through you madam mayor just a question to um damian when you do the acoustic report when they do the acoustic testing um it will be better if it 's a the acoustic as attended when they 've got a function on uh from distances like um council mckibben mentioned the noise going over water so that um if we put a time limit on it and they don 't have many functions between now and march it can 't_''_4479.92 be tested properly just a question i 'm sorry counselor what 's the question will the testing be done during a function through the chair um i think that would be up to the acoustic consultant um counsellor um but something we could put to them if the applicant decides to go ahead with the the thank you thank you okay counselors i 'm putting the amendments out from mccarthy just another concern um there 's an acoustic report done by their the council or state government and there is no um levels taken on the actual site it 's done by a model i just think we 've got to be aware of that in other words the blue metal quarry they do not do the acoustic report on site it 's done by a model and it 's done by a whole resident event through the chair that may be the case but it would have been done under a standard that 's been put in place through the through the appropriate noise guidelines or legislation so um there would be a standard that that the acoustic modeling would need to meet in order to get the green light from from um from from any event that they have council line cancel on your muted yes right sorry just another question on sound that um when you have music the bass sound is louder than the high-pitched sound so when the testing is done it 's often done on a high-pitched sound but a bass sound is different so that if you 're looking at music and all you hear as a high note it 's registered as a low note but if you put in like like council mccarthy mentioned a bird squealing is a high note and it registers as a louder noise we 're looking at at um approving functions that do have a lot of bass sounds coming from their music which will carry and it may be annoying more annoying than if they 've got a violin playing because you 're looking at a different sound altogether thank you the question would be the measurements of the sounds done on actual the actual thing that they 're doing so if they 're playing music on a night with 120 people in the room that 's when it needs to be tested and it needs to be tested from distances thank you as well take that as a comment okay counselors counseling the impact in relation to section 4.1.5 of the environmental assessment act do we all need training in acoustic testing and how it works because otherwise i 'm relatively ignorant in this area i can see council lines with some experience but i 'm a professional okay so if yeah so we don 't have to understand it as long as our council 's you need to have it read again because i don 't i don 't have it in my head anyone else so the amendment is that council defer the modification development application one zero two zero one nine nine two until an acoustic report is provided that satisfies section four dot five of the environmental planning and assessment act that the acoustic report be obtained by the 31st of march 2022 and that a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. all in favor of the amendment i can 't see councillor sorry i can 't see as any councillors all in favor of the amendment councillor kellerman council mckibben against councillor dhoni mckechnie mccarthy cable said whitney and gibbons and lion thank you the amendment 's defeated we go back to the original motion and the recommendation is that council refuse modification development application 10201992 as additional information has not been provided for assessment under section 415 of the environmental planning and with section 375a of the local government act 1993 all in favor carriage unanimously thank you very much 1305. development application 102021.21 and 102018.832 function center camping ground and animal training facility again i have to add the reasons to the reasons through the recommended why the recommendation has been recommended the way it has and i will now read that out including those reasons which will be found in the body of your report recommendation the recommendation is but council approved da10 [Music] for the use of the function center animal training facility and camping grounds with conditions at 370 the meadows road the meadows for the following reasons hey the development is consistent within the over on local environmental plan 2013. the development is consistent with all relevant controls of the oberon development control plan 2001. overall the impact of the function center animal training and boarding establishment and campsites can be appropriately mitigated to ensure minimal adverse impacts on the subject land and the locality two council approved da2018832 for the commercial use of the existing horse arena at 370 the meadows road at the meadows the development is consistent with all relevant controls of the oberon development control plan 2001 overall the impact of the commercial use can be appropriately mitigated to ensure minimal adverse impacts on the subject land and the locality three a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. i have a move or counselor 's place that 's what come on do i have the second one how 's the facebook thank you also caleb do you wish to speak to them before oh thank you um first off just to value one area and the users of this particular family are putting to this property that is the function center and the horse training facility and the camping ground the primitive camping ground are actually permitted in iu1 so they have a right to undertake to move the issue really comes down to the neighboring areas and is there any undue effects on the amenity for those people who surround that area and if there isn 't is an effect can be mitigated in some way now most of the issues that have been potential noise from the function centers this development at its core is also the residence of the persons involved in the development they live there and they are on-site residents for all of their events the horse training sessions are limited to generally 15 people as noted in the reports and i expect them to be very low impact on the route of neighbouring residences i think one of the more telling issues raised was the traffic leaving there at night and i think that uh some screening along the proposed car park will mitigate that and sensible uh movement along speedos road it 's probably more likely than not so i think the amenity for most people will not be unduly effective if it is there is complaints process and we should we should as a council be very cognizant of what complaints may be made and how our mitigation can be further enhanced so i 'm i 'm recommending that this dav approved with cognizance of screening of the car park to reduce light affects the neighboring properties and to also monitor the convenient complaints of the receipt appreciate that change is often difficult for a lot of us and i think when something different comes into our communities it always sort of waves a flag [Music] because it 's different and i think that we have to learn to accept some change i think um going out there and having a look at this site um and reading the information that we have here i 'm a lot more relaxed about it than i was the fact that i was a little bit concerned for a start when i read about primitive camping but having read the information uh the the fact that it will be limited to four sites and that will be the the horse uh people who will be there it 's got nothing to do with uh with weddings there 'll be no accommodation provided for wedding guests um i think i think that that will not be a major issue for anybody in the community these people have done an acoustic report that is very comprehensive and and raises no no serious issues with um with the acoustics i um i 'm to the oberon community i think it will be on sure that we 'll be very well run i think that will be a benefit to to the overall community here in obama thank you councillor you have a comment for councillor gibbons could you unmute councillor gibbons please through the chair i 've had a look at the road there uh it 's a 50 year old road and very narrow and very rough i just think my comments are that they must contribute to the road it 's uh the people have been using the road they know the road it 's a narrow road that 's at least two sets of culverts short uh there 's no sight distance coming up from the other way i just think we should be allowing we should be placing a contribution suggestion council upgrade the road and they pay for the soil it 's a kilometer road it 's fifty thousand we 're talking about other roads i just think it would be some sort of compensation to the people that live about there if they had a decent road floats rattle around on a road that 's not built properly and as i say it 's a 50 year old road it 's got bitsmen then it needs to be upgraded to a much better standard well we 're talking seven meter standards from others and uh a simple way of put putting this forward is we know what it costs to seal a road we know by the meter we know by the kilometer i think there should be a contribute for them to contribute the serving of that rate if the raid was upgraded by council or there 's some way you know you could add some benefit for the people down there that 's had this impulse put it upon them but i think it 's a great facility i think as previous speakers have said it 's something that 's uh a horsey place and uh it 's very good and there 'll be plenty of activities going on the roads are shocking to me thanks man thank you council online um yes i just have a um i guess question to the town planner approved smaller blocks we have created lifestyle and is lifestyle included in a you can put it on paper that we 're going to have this and we 're going to have that but the impact on the people that have bought in this in this district around that area of that application um have possibly moved there because of lifestyle now what is lifestyle they might have come to the country because it 's much quieter they 've come to the country for many different reasons um they 've come to can 't come to raise have a larger block of land and raise a few animals myself and that looks like that has happened down meadows road that we have people that have come for a lifestyle and i 'm just wondering if that can be taken into consideration when we as a council approve somebody coming in and saying yes this is wonderful but it looks like it 's going to affect a lot of people and their lifestyle thank you comment thank you council alone any other comments here comes councilman johnny thanks matt and matt my comments that um i will be supporting the motion um i 'd like to make some comments on something a few things one i said before of this what effectively council of line is talking about lifestyle or all sorts of stuff is that land use conflict in our zones you know we 've got an r1 zone um we have a beautiful landscape i think i commented at the meeting last night as big as it is uh the reports say there 's no heritage items now why are we building these why are people keen to build these things where they are it 's because they 're in a beautiful natural area now if that is not an asset that we should at some stage consider in the future is to be narrow side that means because you don 't call landscape a heritage you just keep filling it up with stuff and eventually remove what is the mission statement of oberon council so going forward i swore i 'd never used that phrase um that that is one of the issues we need to deal with see there 's significant land use conflict between the asset of the zone and the residents of the zone who are there for all sorts of different reasons um i again i feel uh that uh judy i will support it but i 'd like to comment on a couple of things one um i share council gibbons concerned about the road if you drive that road in a ordinary car and another ordinary car comes the other way you simply do not fit both cars have to put wheels off into the gutter let alone um a bus with um you know 50 drunks or um or the size of completely self-contained horseplays i think we do we 're missing the elephant in the room unless we do something about the condition of that road if you drive up to the car park are actually up onto the proposed car park position um your lights and any movement there do scan at least the rooftop of of the the dwellings that are in fact quite close not just the most immediate one but one further down you 're actually don 't think i 'm not sure that layland is will provide a sufficient buffer so i am trusting the council and the proponent that if the neighbors complain that there will be a more significant buffer in that area i think the car park and the camping area are in the wrong spot but it 's almost as if the idea of a function center came after they built themselves a shed they built themselves a big shed had a look at the shed and thought that 's great let 's make it a function center but that means everything 's locked on close to the road everything should actually be much farther away from from the road um lastly the comments made that the people who run it will be living there i didn 't read that anywhere else it just manages cottage because the manager will be on site when i read manager i thought that would mean anybody not necessarily the the actual owners now i complement the applicant on the way that they have responded to every submission and every approach from council and bent encouragement from their acoustic report that says the facility commits to the continuing consideration of the amenity of the site neighbours and shall take all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure the conduct of the facility does not unduly impact on the surrounding area so they 're offering a great deal can i ask through you madam mayor that town plan used a phrase to me yesterday that described the situation where residents felt they were not meeting the requirements and how do the residents then seek satisfaction yeah i asked the town planner what was the through the chair um i think that would be just with compliance with the relevant conditions that are in the consent the council would um ensure comply with those if we receive complaints um we 'd act on those so it is through non-compliance with the conditions correct okay sorry through the chair again the acoustic report would be is included in condition number one if i may add the there is also a condition regarding the contributions councils that would require uh close to five thousand dollars for rural roads which the of the construction studio going forward thank you madam mayor i i this will have a strong impact on the people around me this is you know quite significant land use conflict there 's no two ways about but legally and morally they 've done a very good job in their proposals i i will be voting for it but i would like to see them really work to remove some of these real significant disadvantages the road the parking area to a lesser extent the camping grip thank you thank you thank you very much i um i have some concerns around a few few parts of the application the road from golden valley road down to the entrance or overcoat it here is um quite narrow having doing a 50-seat school bus on that route for several years i can tell you it 's almost impossible to pass a truck or a stop float or that without almost pulling to a stop or off the road so i 'd like to see some contributions at least from um down to the road from the gold valley corner down i have some reservations about how close it is to some of the um some of the other properties but if the um screening is suitable which in a couple of years it probably will be because they they normally grow to one half two meters in a couple of years so allowing that there 's no drought and half of them don 't die and it should be okay but um the other the other thing is i agree again with counselor danny that the camping location the camping area is probably not the most suitable for the residents or adjoining residents but in fact it 's probably been an afterthought otherwise it would be over near the equestrian center down below the hill but uh in saying all that given that um what we 've seen out there and that work that 's been done there 's no shortcuts and there are some commitments in there to facilitate issues if they do come up and it complies with our planning policies it would be difficult to disallow thank you councilman councillor thank you councilman kevin thank you madam previous speakers um i was also concerned and obviously having a view to a view on monday which was this week has assisted i am concerned about both meadows road and the mount olive road and the intersection of them um and i know councillor given saying it would cost 50 000 to probably picks up the meadows road for that last part that wasn 't that we haven 't done and the contribution will be given by the proponent is about five thousand dollars um so that won 't solve the issue uh completely and there are i am concerned about the traffic issues and the width of the road for passing traffic and also the lights um they have planted leilani they are in the ground already but as we know probably they won 't provide a buffer a particularly good buffer for probably the first five years i 'd say conservatively and i agree that the camping ground is probably not the most ideal place but the total proposal does comply with our u1 zoning and where we 're going forward obviously the next council period for important area about planning in this whole oberon area which will come in we have to look at our oep and all our overarching planning documents and it 's really up to the residents of this shire to decide whether they want to become the southern islands a lot of small allotments or whether we keep our major business agriculture and keep large allotments and keep the agriculture industry that 's purely a comment madam mayor um but it is from the oberon people to obviously make that decision and i 'd suggest that we may not do some type of um get some kind of opinion on that so overall um i 'm more in support of the animal training use uh because i think that 's more in line with ru1 the function center is an adjunct i think we 've probably it 's allowable within the ru1 definition um [Music] as i said my concern is that we are going to become very much dominated by function centers i don 't know if they 'll all have a lot of business because i pipeline but overall i say i would speak it in favor of the proposal council mccarthy i 'll come back to you councillor lyon councilman i 'll fail to see how we can support this on two basis we know that the road 's narrow we have a requirement that you 're doing the development that the road if there 's so many people on it it 's got to be certain with if there 's more people on it it 's going to be wider this road the top of the hill is only 5.2 meters and i think further down it 's less the intersection of the um man olive road is also dangerous and if you get on your tom tom and you 've got whatever you want to go back to batters it sends you down the manhole road which is what 's on the very mountain but one of the conflicts that happened here is the rhines have been there for over a hundred years and what happens at nighttime when these people leave with those big light bars that lights all their backyard up their privacy 's gone been positive there positive moves why he hasn 't put a bar or a sort of unbun along the road to some sort of height to facilitate the ryan 's price has got me beat because it 's all right to go and play leo landis now but if you 're gonna are we gonna defer his operation until the land is established no we 're not we want to operate straight away the rhines are really impacted on this and and it 's unfair and i think the safety issue alone we 've asked for other developments to increase the size of the raid and i think this one should be not approved until that road that we come up with some sort of meanable solution whether he contributes more um i know you 're talking about the five thousand dollars for the is that for the section 95 is it for a cottage isn 't it yeah that 's for the rural raves but that 's for a cottage isn 't it what i 'm saying is if it was a an event center which has a major out on the roadway but this has got major impact and it should be more like whether we go enhanced or whatever i don 't know but we have that schedule i 'm appalled at the recommendation that from the engineer that we accept the 5.2 and the biggest comment i got back and it 's a pub comment and it doesn 't pass the blood test they don 't live in the area and i 'm sorry but it 's right the impact is the horse people don 't get over they 've got a horse a valuable horse in the back of there with a horse boat it 's 2.4 wide they will not move off that track so therefore it 's up to the other person that 's got to get over like i 'm sorry but i think the road impact and the light impact of the two things that this should be deferred until there 's something more substantial done on this development then then we 've got to accept it it 's in those ru1 areas and we 've got to accept that these on the local people thank you councilman did you want to respond um thank you um the contribution is based on uh quite a lot that so previously they would have paid um contribution when they um had the dual occupancy approved yep so then as they applied for another application they were required to pay their next contribution but there 's no contribution for that what 's same center is it no it 's based on the allotment and that 's where it 's wrong right cancer line um sorry to keep coming back to this point of acoustics how can the acoustics be measured on this place if they haven 't had a function so what are the acoustics measuring if the function is going to disturb the 15 neighbors um so so that 's my question how can the acoustic be um judged on the impact it 's going to have on all those people um what are you measuring through the chair they 're modelled through the industrial noise policy that 's provided to you as part of the additions in the attachments yes i understand is a different measurement when you put a measurement thing you put a measurement they come out and they put a measurement thing up and it measures the noises that are normal aeroplanes going over bird screeching cars coming down just normal noise what i 'm questioning is if we 're putting up a function center that is going to have functions that interfere with the livelihoods of 15 neighbors where is the measurement of that modelling through the chair it 's modeled through the requirements of the industrial noise policy that 's oh you know yeah i understand that and i 've i 've seen those measuring machines and i see how they work but we 're approving something that 's going to disturb 15 people possible possibly disturb 15 families we 're going to approve it so i wouldn 't vote for the recommendation thank you thank you council line okay councillor gibbons you 're muted councillor gibbons to the chair just one more comment about the road i just believe we have a duty of care there 's 30 odd people live down that way you know we require in some stages eight metre roads i think a seven metre roads there but if this is going to be decided tonight and we haven 't sorted this road issue out i cannot support it on that basis i just feel we have a duty of care for all users on the road thank you thank you council givens okay councillors i 'm going to now put counselor donors thank you very much for your consideration there i 'm just asking whether i was the general manager or the planning department through you have a an out of you know we can 't um defer this because people want to start their business but is there a conditioning of any nature that we can apply to stage to meet some of these concerns i think the answer 's no but i 'm just asking through you met a man i 'll defer to the leading director she would need to consider that um in terms of the rate i might refer that to the services director through the chair counsellor a lot of we have already conditioned a noise so you mentioned earlier the the management presidents that wasn 't in the original se because that was a matter that we conditioned after the exhibition and and then the hours of operation and the number of events and the use of the site is being conditioned as well and the hours of operation we 've actually reduced them during the weekday hours as well so there was a number that was listed in the report that we already have conditioned to meet these requirements including tree planting as well which the applicant 's already undertaken so so just through the chair just to probably sum up and answering your question about is there a way that you can progress the matter um the only way that i could see that you can progress the matter is through what we otherwise know as a planning agreement and we seek to lodge into a planning agreement with the applicant with the direct process of trying to mitigate any of the road issues that have been raised today there 's probably enough um information from councillors to to to outline why but once again it is an agreement between the landowner and council in relation to the matter so council has the opportunity to provide an additional condition to state that council owner and a planning agreement with the owners outlining the issues relating to road matters which may be um council 's intention as part of the conversation that i 've heard in lieu of trying to ameliorate the conditions of um traffic impacts on certainly the area between the meadows road and property is it possible that that planning agreement a can appear as an amendment to this and secondly by direction deal with road and possible earth funding in the through the chair the two different issues to start with other planning agreement relates to the very thing that a number of councils have raced here this evening as what they believe is a is a reason for refusal so in order to limit that there is an opportunity for council staff through a condition that says that council enter into a planning agreement with the land owner to look at impacts of that road on the well current road right has the ability to do that it works in a similar way as well the waldara development would work in terms of giving a contribution in fact to one and and lessening the impact of the road now that would be a council 's discretion to implement the planning agreement condition that then would be an agreement because that 's what a planning agreement is in some type of negotiation between council and the landowner as to how that would be format or formulated through you madame is therefore both to you and the general manager is it possible to foreshadow an amendment of some nature to include that planning agreement or is that not necessary i 'm thrilled that the council had the opportunity to say approve it subject to an additional condition that outlines the requirements that we know we would seek to enter into a planning agreement to mitigate the impacts of the current road that the development will have an impact so it can be incorporated into the current application without the need for a substantial amendment subject to the two the mover a planning agreement is an agreement between council and the developer or the applicant it 's not it 's not as strong as a condition it has to be agreed to and then it would then be reinforced by council once a planning agreement was in place correct so what so what the implementation of a planning planning agreement will do is allow the development to be approved so things can occur on site and in the process staff can talk to the applicant and the owners about the concerns that arrays the issues and what that means at the end of the day the agreement will be approved between council and the landowner not staff it 'll be account will be a document that will afford the council so matter meant with your gracious forbearance sorry councillor so what if you reach a point where the developer and the council don 't come to an agreement in the planning agreement um it 's the same as any other application where if the applicant is aggrieved by the conditions of consent impose they can go to court there are opportunities speak i would love to for you to ask also to ask the movers of the second is whether they would consider that additional element to the recommendation [Music] at some point feel free the planning agreement so if an amen if um an amendment was made to the recommendations referring to a planning agreement between council and the proponent if the proponent doesn 't agree to enter into a planning agreement then we have provided approval under this recommendation then does that mean it goes through anyway number one that 's my first question the second question is i don 't know if if we 've considered or whether senior town planners considered whether signs would be appropriate requesting people to have low beam in a car park and low beam on exiting the property that may or may not be something that 's been considered [Music] like an event management plan where that could be teased out as well so but but are they currently proposing low beam for exiting the premises in the can for any use of the car park is that or would that be that would be part of the event management plan that they would they would implement as part of minimizing their impact on the joint management if we made it a condition then they have to be part of the part of every event management plan in any revised management plan i 'm just requesting wondering if that 's possible so going back to the first question if they refuse to enter to sign up to a planning agreement and we have given approval then it goes through without a planning event doesn 't it come through the chair your approval is subject to the conditions that you impose on on the planning area so we 'd have to elucidate the conditions now at this meeting so than say the planning agreement that deals with the following issues one two three so through the chair my recommendation would be that council simply put as an additional condition that council enter into a planning agreement with the with the proponent in order to minimize traffic impacts that have been outlined on the current meadows road yeah traffic impacts and i suppose that be cognizant of neighbors or there 's some signage on the road that that alerts people to that it 's all i 'd be happy to second such an amendment if the council had only wishes for proposals if it 's an amendment i need an amendment if it 's in addition to the recommendation subject to councillor kellerman council of people yeah we 'll just get this down let 's catch some fun so that would become number three and then number four will be can you remember i could you read that out pleasure [Music] [Music] is so we now have number three that council enter into a planning agreement with the landowner in relation to upgrade of the meadows road to minimize concerns raised relating to the current road conditions talk and i also think it needs to look at the intersection of meadows road at mount olive road okay councillors this is that 's why we so this is not what we want at all it may i suggest that we 're planning the landowner in relation to traffic issues traffic issues raised concerning meadows road been about the condition of the road and and the light storage sort out exactly how they 're going to approach make it a bit because i think what we 're worried about is the light spillage from the unsigned on-site car park and exiting them and exiting yeah that 's without saying i 'll go the general manager here because i don 't think this all right belongs in the recommendation thank you madam mayor um through the chair the planning agreement would relate to council entering the agreement on the public road if council was of a concern that spillage from the car park is an issue that they want to see dealt with in a more stringent manner they should do it as a separate condition because it relates to that lean in which the development 's on not an agreement that you want to put in place to help make them contribute to an upgrade of something that you that leads to the development that persists so i i 'd see them as two different conditions four out of four is that something is that something agreement rules that they 've provided as part of the application but only only as a result of the landscaping it 's not dealt with to dim the lights as you leave i don 't think is it no it 's really that wouldn 't be the case that would be part of their on-site operational plan that they say please be cognizant of our neighbours and in this space we recommend you do x y and z so we 're ensure that 's in the event um based on this conversation i would suspect that that 's something that the planners would insist on including in their event planned that they 'd be nice as part of this be nice to have a sign too to remind people i think he is always interested in there they already have mentioned that in the condition what low beam that they come back and say we 'll put signage up notifying people of their obligations the reference to 52 events there 's 20 events sorry we need to get this sorted yes before we go into something else well this is councillor callum and councillor kate will have agreed to put in that council enter into a planning agreement with the landowner in relation to traffic issues raised concerning the meadows road to minimize concerns that doesn 't flow and that should be it that should be it yeah if councillor kellum and councillor kate will agree with and that sight lines it covers the intersection covers the road right okay so you 're happy with that yeah the other stuff is about operational plants yeah which should be in the conditions of the concentration and well do we need to do that there so it is included in the operational plans [Music] additional measures so that 's very hard to do once you 've kind of approved they 've got a complaint process in place that neighboring properties can complain to this council yes i 'm just wanting to ensure that when we put it into the that that you know it 's enshrined rather than a venom plan that um low beam and less and bonding might be appropriate too prescriptive right this is not the place to be this comes in the workings underneath this with the planning department council mccarthy um one thing what we 're trying to saw there the applicant is listening so surely goodness he gets the message but what happened with um one of these events um that 's on the german r road mr frye highlighted the other night 95 of the people aren 't like in other words they come here they don 't give a rat 's ass and that 's why we made it counselor please speak your language no no that 's a defining what this means i don 't in other words they come there and it might be the only time they come there but we 've got to try and protect the local people the best we can we we 're on the right track i think from what 's been changed tonight i don 't think we work on the basis that everyone that comes through there is is like that i think we assume that they 're responsible people thank you councillors is there any further comment on the resolution as its recommendations then i 'm going to put the resolution in four parts all in favor all right so that 's council humans councillor callum councillor dhoni councilman technique councillor council mccarthy council michigan so caroline are you against councilman again she 's singing very minor just go back over that again was it a an amendment and was it put up so that i could read it sorry it 's not an amendment counselor there was an extra um addition to to the recommendation point three so it 's now in four parts and the fourth the fourth part was just read it out to me please it 's part three counsellor i 'm sort of proof part two i 'm sorry part two counselors i 'm but council enter into a planning agreement with the landowner in relation to traffic issues raised concerning the meadows road is this on your screen no it 's not on my screen okay did you hear what i said though yes i did are you voting in favor of that yes encouraging animals to me thank you thank age 71 is a recommendation that 's a recommendation that council placed the footpath lighting from christian life centre to oberon public school project on the grants matrix for further grant funding opportunities can i have a mover please councilman kevin and a second approach council carol thank you councilman do you wish to speak to this oh look thank you madame i think it 's great that the youth council 's been involved with this and they 've proposed this obviously something that 's needed we 've obviously heard we 've spoken about tonight so one i would fully move to um accepted by council um i would like later or some other time maybe some more discussion involving the three options below um but once we 've made this recommendation you can look at those outside these meetings to understand better the recommendation okay i just think we need to try to budget the 80 to 110 because we need to get some idea of price so that when we come up we want to do along with say 400 000 and all of a sudden someone loses out because of the 30 000 's going to cost 110 then we know that it 's going to cost that was part of my suggestion in having a look at those areas later not knowing we don 't have to decide that now so through the chair having it on your grants matrix gives you that opportunity to satisfy yourself about that but in the meantime when you 're told 1307 draft cornell recreation ground master plan the recommendations in two parts the council placed the draft of connell recreational ground must excuse me master plan on public exhibition for a minimum period of 28 days that upon completion of the exhibition period a further report be provided to council outlying outlining submissions received can i have a mover please can i suggest what do you want to add something to the recommendation i do matter yeah um the council organized a community meeting at o 'connell to facilitate the feedback [Music] through the chair so you want another meeting after an exhibition period to discuss the outcomes of the exhibition during the exhibition i draw your attention to the fact that the um community to develop a master plan which is a key development in their area it 's a very high level interest i 'm not saying it for any other reason that i think it would be appropriate community relations to take this down and have another community meeting to discuss it be given the community buy-in and commitment to it at this point through the chair during the commute during the public exhibition period or post it no jury during that that would be our processes because our community engagement strategy would dictate that that 's what we would do so we would propose during this exhibition period to doing exactly that i didn 't see it but if you 're saying you 're going to do it i 'm happy through the chair your community engagement processes that you as a council will endorse make it our responsibility to in fact do that we don 't normally through the medicare we don 't normally do that when things go into public submission public exhibition we do sometimes this is just one of those times i 'd like it to happen be our intention to do that regardless thank you very much sorry councilman on with the recommendation i 'm having a second [Music] yes on page 73 the matter 's raised by the community it comes all the way down to funding there 's one missing drainage and it was highlighted the meeting and there was one submission by a plate for the sb number plates and he highlighted that there should be trainees there to pick up the car park the pavilion and take the water around to go to o 'connell road and i think there was a written submission handed in to the council as well and it should be highlighted in that can i draw your attention to the table second um down then grant funding 349 500. 79 is for drainage and it 's it 's highlighted with the activity without the proper drainage this area is not a function you might have it there 's your stage and drainage and normal rest of the day needs to be highlighted and that is raised by the council consultation session included drainage okay it 's it um in case anybody hasn 't uh heard the 349 thousand dollars through the building better regents fund stage two has been successful and they will now have that that money added to the little pool brings it up to around about a million dollars for this project oh thank you man i was just going to say that i thought when we put this out the public exhibition uh we should indicate what our grand funds are as you said over a million dollars about a million dollars and indicate which what stage two also involves in some detail so they know how much of this is actually funded and what 's not funded you can read it you can get it from this largely but i think it should be set out clearly so through the chair as part of that consultation process that we do with the o 'connell residents it would highlight that as part of the scope yeah but if we could when we put it on public exhibition on our website i think we should also do that so we this is what 's and um i can 't actually recall what was exactly in the 349 000. i think it was the i can 't design yeah but i think that 's that that would that would help to understand where we are and maybe what funding is there to complete the rest of it thank you thank you council any other comments council 's customer company the 349 was that the money that andrew judy yes yes so that state isn 't that federal total money through the chip through the chair there is another allocation that 's been awarded that wasn 't included in this graph in this table it 's under pending allocate pending applications first line that 's that 's successful okay all right but didn 't the people then not [Music] through the chair as part of lodging this application and remember this is stronger country communities which is now 18 months old council put a number of things that they wanted to see as part of developing the draft master plan they 've taken the considerations from all the consultation that we did pre-developing this master plan original and as part of our process if the the intention of council is not to have a picket fence now we will seek to have that amended as part of our as part of that funding duty i was just going to point out the council mccarthy that if you 've got this map here if you look at about three o 'clock it says to a floyd damage to a fence around the field due to speed of incoming and receding waters as opposed to a one meter high mound six metres wide which creates one to three multiple slopes around the field if required a simple leading fence with rustic posts can be constructed with the mound and space to stop quicker balls at a later date thank you i was just trying to clarify a situation thank you council house forgiveness yeah through the chair very happy with it all it 's exciting times down there just with the oval um they 've got north on here and it 's it 's facing the wrong way a bit with the cricket pitch all cricket pictures should the west into the sun i can 't see the ball uh just on all the diagrams it just shows the cricket pits but i just want to point out that it 's uh it 's sort of running a bit the wrong way the beacons field roads about north that 's just something that 's incidental but needs to be picked up somewhere along the line looks to me like it does run north yeah i think it does run north you look at the last map just look at the yeah if you look at the o 'connell road that 's running parallel with the o 'connell road the ones i 've seen the o 'connell straps down the bottom and north is uh sort of over the o 'connell road direction and the cricket pictures is running more not west than north okay i think they 've got the north arrow wrong the other day looking and that might determine how the field sort of fits to the cricket ground be the look of it it 's not a round oval it 's more of a yeah great concept and exciting times thank you as well any more comments counsellors the technical services director chris technical service type of comment i 'm sorry i didn 't see your name yeah thanks madame i just wanted to clarify yes that is conceptual at the minute it may be just out of whack in terms of the cricket pitch um that certainly is again as to say conceptual could be adjusted to suit north south taking that into account and just to clarify councillor mccarthy asked a question about drainage there earlier the initial funding did only allow for drainage from the uh construction of the new sporting field of course at that time we didn 't have uh an overall master plan about other amenities and how that would connect so uh there may be additional funding be allocated or have to be allocated at a later date uh to take it into connectivity of other uh assets that are constructed just for clarification through which it i 'll just confirm that the additional funding sources will allow for that to occur it 's not additional funding that to put too small a pipe under the oval and then have to dig it up and put a bigger one to take account of all the amenities i think that works thank you to the director i 'm now going to put this recommendation in two parts all in favor harrington here 77 page 77 191308 infrastructure contributions bill there 's a recommendation in two parts that council receive and note the report item 13lh and that council support the new local government new south wales campaign to modify the infrastructure contributions bill do i have a mover councillor kellerman a secondary councilman um when i attended the webinar with the planning director it became apparent very quickly that um there are several serious flaws with the process that the state government is recommending the first floor is that the tenant we 've worked under for many decades is that the developer pays a contribution because the developer is the entity that gets the most benefit out of any particular in-cost placed on the community and they should pay for that and the ratepayers will then pay for the state government proposing actually twist that around a bit they are looking at reducing development contributions and the making the infrastructure then a rate payer responsibility for provision infrastructure as well as maintenance so effectively the developers now go get a much cheaper run and the rate payers get to pay more for infrastructure to support developments that 's the main effect for us in the more in a statewide sense the government is proposing to amalgamate all the developer contributions or substantial parts of their development contributions into original funds now this doesn 't affect us this effectively affects the greater sydney area from the childhood up to the hunter valley but those councils will be paying money into these regional funds and then having to compete with each other to get the money out from these regional funds which will be administered by the state government so it is taking everything about this has taken power away from local councils to produce what is needed by their communities the other dangerous thing about this is that it 's legislation light and regulation heavy and so significant changes to under parliamentary discrimination using legislation so it 's an advantage to developers it is engaged whatever state government is in power and it 's a disadvantage to ratepayers across new south wales there 's a campaign being led by uh local government new south wales and that involves mural minutes uh and lobbying um our local members and i think you 've indicated previously i think without providing direction i think we probably should um leverage our uh local member who are now the courses of this deputy of planning and development and deputy mayor for their um insight into this infrastructure contributions bill um and i have obviously the papers presented and done some research and in particular i think the bullet points at the bottom of page 77 and going over to 78 obviously cause us some major issues including the permanent deferred payment of contributions until the occupation 's commute is issued which could go on for infinity for some of our for some development applications and the dictation to councils how and how they spend their contributions and the other issues raised had some significant impact more so on the four regional infrastructure contribution areas where they can those contributions can be reflected to all used for other for other council areas so i note that even if we get the regulations and i know that they would meant to be due if we went to go on public exhibition in october i 'm assuming they haven 't yet that even if we get those draft regulations um then any of these can be changed without having to go back to poland because they are regulations and there are ministerial directions so we 're only going to see the initial ones and they could be changed anytime in the future without these without reference back to poland and that also concerns me so i suppose i would be also i 'm not sure how but we i think we should also be saying the local government we do really do not agree with that arbitrary ability for ministers to be able to change regulations and ministerial directions without every government gets in just changes the regulations and ministerial directions uh to favor whatever particular projects they to second this recommendation in two parts saying there is no such thing as public interest there is no such thing as the column it 's a terrible strategy in every way we can generally legislatively is i hope you 're right um about uh the hard road for the government yesterday it seems to be an increasing trend of governments of all persuasions to govern or to wish to govern by regulation and and that is a tomorrow i think that 's a very frightening uh way for them to go and and i think a lot of people in the community don 't understand the fact that there 's a big difference between legislation and regulation uh so it just goes by and and governments seem to be able to get away with it and i 've said i think i 've said this here before i can see looking into the future that this is just a backdoor way of achieving trying to achieve what they missed out on four or five years ago it 's a way it 's a way to i mean councils councils heard some some startling figures about the the the forecast for rape rises um communities are going to blame councils for that um we know what will happen when the next time it comes around it 's got the back doorway of amalgamations just because they they withdrew the suggestion before doesn 't mean that they 've forgotten about it that 's what they want you know they 'll keep going until they achieve it i think history 's shown us that thank you council somebody if there 's no further comment well it 's green i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor very generously thank you okay counselors item 1309 change of date december 2021 ordinary meeting there 's a recommendation there that the december ordinary council meeting be held on thursday the 30th of december 2021 commencing at 10 a.m can i have a mover please council kellerman councilman kicking thank you how 's the killing do you wish to speak to them yes the change in the date of the election and the advertised dates for the closure of postal ballots means that um pole declared until very late before christmas like probably the 23rd perhaps um and so to reduce um impost on on new councils who may have been going for christmas in other places i think that the answer the only answer we can really have is a meeting between christmas and new year and that meeting will only be effectively for swearing-in of councillors an election of mayor and deputy mayor and i assume the committees and then we will adjourn but i think prospective councillors should be aware that that will be a the date the first meeting they will attend and there will also be lots of homework to do through january for the induction processes [Music] um as i was intending to be a way over that buried in this [Laughter] is be a well i suppose we can 't do it by zoom i just have to come back through through the chair the rationale behind 30th of december also incorporates the provisions around the local government act that allow meetings to be zoomed up until the end of december so the the ability to be the first of january they wouldn 't be there so the opportunity for any council that is elected to join that meeting by zoom is available putting recommendation counsellors all in favor harry thank you page 81 councillors 1401 monthly activities activity report general manager the recommendation is that the report item is receivers information can i have the only thing that i do recall and i wish that the general manager to take it up but we had a report once that said that the council is going to do a better job of building the carports down at the uh self-care units it 's not anything madame it 's not in here but it was a report from the general manager originally that we took 110 000 from work off the builder and we were going to do it we were going to do better that 's still not done just don 't look to be done in the next year so i 'm asking the general manager to take charge of what he said he was going to do and get it done please um through the took over that component was because instead of spending 110 000 we got a quote for 40 and we 're looking to develop those carports for 40 rather than 110. i thought that was reasonably good governance from that perspective that 's not quite right because in that 110 there was a quad mix and there was the extra concrete from where the carport sits so anyway council just a comment on the whs section well very very good to see that we 've gone from february or february through down in september without a lost time uh injury and uh also from february through to now without a medical treatment injury and given the amount of work that our staff have been undertaking in the amount of hours they 're doing that 's um that 's an excellent result so the toolbox meetings and the near-miss reporting and thing as it 's reporting it 's obviously paying dividends and the training that has gone into the whs is showing how worthwhile benefit benefits from it and how it worked why it was i should be commended on the results job and and going about it in an aware fashion which is good they must be uh they must be happy in their work touch thank you councilman or any other community counselor i 'm putting the recommendation all in favor and unanimously thank you page 93 council 1402 monthly activity report plan any development the recommendation is that the report item 1402 has received its information president cuban thank you a second to please council mccarthy um thank you madam man um an extensive report and i note that on page 94 at the bottom there 's a table there of the applications lodged as was subject to a resolution so i 'm assuming that the column headed date sub portal means the date that they first access the portal to put any information in and obviously submission has a term under the act or lodgement and that runs from the second column then the time frame actually under legislation runs from the second column the date the subpool was the date they start to lodge it um and they start that 's the first step first activity where correct have i got it right through the chair that 's correct councillor as i 've explained before the applicants can lodge on the significant portal um we may require a payment of fees or some additional information that is required prior to the application being formally lodged yes and once that payment is made then we we lodge the application which as you said is the second column so the dates commence from there for time so we have a whole lot of lodgement dates there but the commencement date has not started for has only started for one through the chair at the time of the um putting this table together these applications haven 't_''_9789.2 been um allocated to the officer oh that 's what that means what that means but i 'm assuming lodgement date is means that they have put everything in that they are required to put in for a da to be assessed is how i understand the truth that 's correct right okay so now that 's that 's as i understand it so now that 's that 's um and i noticed then if there 's a stop the clock then the information received from that stop the clock is then the date that that 's provided is in that second last column that 's correct i 'm reading this correctly and then the determination right now i think that 's um that satisfies what we asked and so i commend the director of planning thank you one other comment on page 93 for my madame it sort of goes over to um a comment that was made in item 14 oh sorry item um 1304 page 105 what 's it all right page 105 under community services and it says community services are sourcing quotes from potential overhaul the heating options for both facilities when this is under independent living units this will include a potential for extending the natural gas connection to all units and installation of new heating outputs through baffle balfour and curtis street facilities where needed so does that mean we 're retro fitting into the new independent living or there i 've already got it we 're just looking at the old okay that 's unclear i 'm asking um i know that they mentioned in two places that 's why i was okay i was wondering why community services were doing it and it wasn 't still under the projects but because i suppose it 's deemed that the projects have been completed in this past community services is that right thank you all right i 'm happy to know that this report be accepted thank you council mccarthy that was pretty straightforward and i thanked daniel for his report the only comment i had i spoke to a planner that uses the portal and their comment was it 's not easy to watch so we really need to get back on the government so they may just go to this portal and that is not user-friendly this person that submits a lot of da 's through the chair i think that 's been the unanimous commentary from every planning member across new south wales to the state that it 's not it 's clunky and needs some work and for the people who like i think yeah they 've had houses on their behalf going to the portal every morning each day and um requiring either notifying or requesting different information or assisting applicants with their um the lodging process so it 's it is difficult and from the start point of view we 're still learning as well on the run thank you credit counseling yes thank you age 98 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please thank you cuban can i have a second account thank you i have a couple of comments one is under paragraph fixing local roads which is one third of the way down page 98 um it 's a little uncertain what that paragraph means site meetings and final negotiations are currently drawing to conclusion with the stabilizing contractor why is that nearly completed are we having final negotiations is one question and then it says the start date is to be confirmed by friday 8th of october 2021. is that for paving or what 's that for it 's unclear from what 's stated there the director yeah thanks madame but the technical services manager was to clarify a starting date uh and certainly the the size of the machine that would be coming to site yeah just confirming and sorry could you just clarify the second question again well the first the first question is if the stabilization is nearly completed or has it been completed why are we entering into final negotiations so question one so let 's start with that one so i 'll just clarify that question um this is round two this is the borrowing road section which hasn 't commenced so that 's basically where we 're at so that 's where why the negotiations with the stabilization okay well that doesn 't this only it just refers campbell 's river raiders previously supported the predominant nine kilometers of stabilizer action work has identified sections of this road have been completed i mean that doesn 't make sense anyway but i understand i think what it means and then it said site meetings and final negotiations are currently drawing the conclusion of the stabilization contract there 's no reference to burrica road a start 2021. so that 's a start date on barrygara okay so just to clarify there 's three different fixing local roads round one round two round three the round one clarification for camels of a road uh we are commencing um with that one here yes so r1 that we 're commencing there on monday with that particular work uh with fixing roku local roads round two we will be commencing in november um a date yet to be just confirmed with a different company this is not answering the question with respect can we just deal with fixing local roads r1 please campbell 's river road as previously reported that predominant nine kilometers of station stabilization work on identified sections of this road have been completed is that correct that is correct and final negotiations are currently drawing to conclusion with the stabilizing contractor is that in respect to campbell 's river road or boriga road as it 's referred in respect to camels of a road so i thought it already been stabilized you said nine kilometers of stabilization works have been completed uh so in clarification to stabilized and that was always part of the scope of work so that is exactly uh what that is referring to so maybe it should say through the chair um and chris can confirm what i 'm saying the roads round one for campbell 's river was in two distinct phases yeah the first phase which dealt with the first nine kilometers in that original upgrade was one part and the second part which is the residual of the 4.8 million dollars will be concluded as part of this calendar year that is correct is it not chris uh yeah this year that is correct two distinct phases in round one i understand that it says a start date is to be confirmed by friday 8th of october 2021 that is in relation to the stabilization works on the extra area is that correct okay on the new phase of the work that dealt with campbell 's river road the second phase that 's what campbell 's working and it 's it is it so when so that 's all relation to stabilization there 's nothing in relation to bitumening and chris can confirm but i think there 's a number of things that will occur in that second phase that 's what i understood so the bitumening will occur after the stabilization works in the eighth of october and has the bitumen work already occurred on the phase one part of campbell 's river road uh so through the chair yes certainly with the first nine kilometers the bitumen has been completed as i did indicate the council running into winter there would be a pause and this is the recommencement of stabilization work with regard to heavy patches and is always followed by a bitumen seal on those components so it is the intent to close out um hopefully before um certainly the summer season could i ask that in future this be worded so that we can actually understand it because i couldn 't understand what you had just told me from that paragraph and i don 't think anyone else could have we would have you know like osmosis trying to get understand it i 'll take that as a comment from you from you councilman got a reference to and i i do commend the technical services director on the amount of work that is actually being undertaken um and in very hard circumstances with the amount of rain we 've had rain the roads are falling apart and council i do understand that council crews have been absolutely stretched um halfway down page 100 um i didn 't actually think the maintenance grading yet occurred on schumacher 's road referenced halfway down and i think that the um good news week in fact indicated that it was going to occur this week yep so at the time through the chairs at the time of writing the report certainly was the intent however we have had um more experienced wet weather which did delay um the greatest moving from the isabella sort of area back out towards berger so unfortunately that 's the delay in writing the report so i do apologize the other thing i wanted to understand is at schumacher 's road and baldridge road are named in our disaffected road matrix for the 1.6 million should we be doing the culverts at as we are doing this re-gravelling because most of the areas of the culverts are going to go in and a lot of cases are where the bad potholes are is there any any chance of bringing from somewhere else to do that on the basis that we 're going to receive the 1.6 million i 'll ask you and the general manager that question because it seems ridiculous to re-gravel the road then have to go out pull the gravel up put the culverts in and put the gravel back through the chair i can answer that um there are a delay obviously and getting certain culvert sizes at the present time uh we have experience at nunes hill road we will be taking delivery that very shortly however uh i don 't see that as a a big impulse or a big problem in actually bridgery for putting those covers in at a later date we are in a position obviously with those two roads at the minute where they are in uh can you hear us chris you 're frozen would you repeat what you could you money is available at this stage uh with the delays and getting uh materials like culverts it wouldn 't be possible to bring those two particular projects together so it wouldn 't be an issue to put those culverts in at a later date it 's really just bringing them up to level and fixing the the approaches to those particular causeways that are currently there um and i have i i assume that the comment in the good news week where you said that we were making the schumacher 's road less inhospitable meant we are not doing that we 're actually making it more hospitable uh yeah look that 's a taipei i apologize again for that councillor mckibben um so yes you are correct i certainly hope so and i do commend that all the work that 's being done thank you madame i 'm very happy to come in just to recommend this report thank you thanks for giving thank you yes through the chair um i 'm a bit disappointed with uh talking about the fixing local roads uh r1 again um the stabilizing was you do your figures it 's come up to two hundred and ten thousand dollars a kilometer left in the budget now we have 230 000 a kilometer to do less work i just was led to believe there wouldn 't be any stabilizing required because that was done and it 's wore through the winter very well with uh a raw road with heavy traffic on it and probably the wettest winter since 1975. i just think it would have been an opportunity to let local contractors finish that road off uh the design was right the widening the graveling everything 's done now for this next stage of 13 kilometers the gravel pits are closer all the litter and all the batters and all the table drains were cleaned by the council as for the whole road so you don 't have that expense you don 't have the expense for the uh stabilization because we know that machines five thousand dollars a day uh i just think we 've got to be very mindful councillors and management about the great commitment to the community of our local shop like we 're always talking about shop load cost support local business they supply all our sporting bodies with uh sponsorship and uh they 're our own local companies that are here and giving to it and that was one ride that we we 're bringing people in outside based on stabilizing and the engineer might be able to point out what how much stabilizing done if there 's a kilometer or two we did nine there was nine kilometers completed there last year by the council i just think we 've got to be very mindful to consider our local companies and contractors before we start bringing outsiders in that doesn 't commit to our council as well and the road that 's been completed there is a very high standard for a band-aid thing of a hunt two hundred and ten thousand dollars i 'm just this stabilizing contractor what opera what grade is he bringing in could the engineer just give us a bit more of a rundown on what he thinks needs stabilizing and what 's just going to be upgraded uh yeah thanks madam always had a plan that would be uh heavy patches and alike uh it was always the objective in which we achieved the nine kilometers in the uh the first summer season on campbell 's river road uh and again certainly um very aware of using or utilizing where we have to external resources or contractors and alike and we will continue to do that across many different projects that we have there 's certainly economies of scale and when your packaging works uh like with stabilizing companies that do offer full services uh with grading watercarts rollers and all sundry to uh you know to to encompass those types of um those packages in doing these works solely for bank you know certainly getting value for money um so it 's it 's not uh without reason councillor um gibbons that we we wouldn 't be using or will not continue to use uh local contractors where we have to uh as you would be aware that we have a myriad of jobs certainly during the 21 22 financial year so certainly we have a number of those engaged yeah there 's a standard needs to be met so uh it 's up to the the engineering people to make sure the super elevator elevations don 't i know they 're i know you don 't need the stabilizer on site before you get some road works done and that was a you know we learned from last time and there 's a few things that uh we can make work a bit better there just on road maintenance i 've been on beaconsfield road an excellent job and uh todd 's road i 've never seen it looking better so if you could pass that on to the relevant operators i think that 's it for me is there any other comment here customer technique yeah man just council mccarthy may recall was before my time on council it 's been brought to my attention that we had planned previously to do some work on bailey 's lane repair some sections of it and actually seal some of them i don 't have too many details this is more on approaches that i 've had from great players it on the roads magic so um i see if it was on there it 's dropped off or wasn 't on there so i don 't have any concrete um any concrete to say that it was on there other than the approaches that i 've had from some residents and some ratepayers in the area but it 's probably one we should have a look at at some stage because i went out there today it 's not good but i just just wanted to raise the issue and maybe we can take it on those and get back to me so i can get back to these people with a with a real answer chris how did you stand up thank you christian did you want to respond do you want to respond directly yeah thanks madam um certainly bailey 's loan did receive a significant amount of money through one of the grants or loans that council took some time ago a council may recall taking about 3.4 million worth for unsealed roads and i do uh can or can say that bailey 's lane did that time to certainly improve bailey 's lane however yes you 're right it 's not on the matrix of any higher picking in order uh for bitumen seal um and again uh it 's not uh in any of the the future budgets uh coming up for for delivery plans to were intended to to put bitumen seal on there at this stage so hopefully that does answer in terms of some work that was or committed by a council that has been undertaken on bailey 's lane of the last three years thank you 300 meters in bailey 's lane in that shadow area that um has constantly shadowed the pine trees and i thought it would come out of section 94. i could be wrong but that 's why i thought the 300 liters was passed in the arc from um where it comes off the road and along there i like to look at 300 meters and like i said i thought we 'd come off the outer section 94. and the report says what we 're doing when do we start on the first kilometer kilometer through the chair certainly working toward that now with pipe culverts going to be coming on board here next week certainly starting that with that installation so it should be shortly thereafter councillor mccarthy to do that that 's in front of all of us uh in front of boards well we could certainly we need to start yes from from the town uh that was the intent to uh to start improving that area so um yes that is the intent yes okay it 's just gold that 's marked on the green and the other one was um have we got any update on the mayfield intersection uh going through the chair um transport from new south wales have uh i did have a meeting with them uh in early october they are to supply us a design they are their intent is wanting to move the center line they believe there 's enough room there to to be able to provide a a passing bay or a shoulder or a lane southbound back into urban so i 'm just waiting that um waiting for that survey network there will be no earth works at this stage i 'm not just not quite clear we did i did put that forward to them at the time of the um of the discussion uh with the advantages of doing some future earth works there uh to to to reduce that embankment downfall for side vision improvement so again i 'm just waiting for the uh the advice back from transport okay thank you because for what i recall it was one of three projects in the last financial years so i want to write off there personally myself and refer to the special last financial year and here we are we 've got nothing back from transfer new south wales now thank you thank you for any other comment putting the recommendation all in favor thank you [Music] monthly activity report corporate services the recommendation is that the items receive this information counselor kevin and the second of class [Music] sorry um halfway down page 103. i think it 's an excellent report i just i think we 've all experienced this issue with the connectivity with uh continue as they are now not our preferred supplier for the future and for how long can we put up with it through through the chairs was able and i probably won 't comment on the first point of the year the second activity oh yes are we like um so i 'm assuming and i 've already raised it before 105 of the um the last paragraph under independent living units i 'm assuming that 's going to come with those we assume those quotes will be under obviously 150 000 that 's why we 're going to quote any idea of what we 're looking at circa range no um [Music] i 'll defer to the back to the corporate who 's the one looking after it thanks man through the chair uh councillor that is correct we that 's the rough uh scan that we 've done we do think that it 'll come under that mark but we are um convincing some investigation work in that space okay thank you thank you madame happy to move that this report any other comments on this one councillors investments the recommendation is that council received the reporters information and movement please council cable and the second to play only to say that i 'm focusing on that 1.9 we 're doing pretty well there yeah thank you counselor that 's a pillow is that actually correct madam 1.9 i 'm in the table at the top of page 111 it 's so out of line with all our other other interest rates i 'm assuming it doesn 't seem correct to me well he 's still not involved it 's not too big live happy to go to the director for a comment bank of queen sorry all right through the chair thanks man uh i 'll i 'll take that one to notice and clarify and come back on that one page 112 item 1406 grants monthly update the recommendation is that the report is received as information councilman and second of these counseling people thank you thank you speak to this one um thank you madame i 'm just picking up on something i think the general manager said previously and if i could go to there has been some announcements in respect to that round four um you seem to indicate that maybe the 250 000 additional had been except the o 'connell wet ground or did i not take that correctly when we have that item up um through the chair the building better regions round five which was pending the three forty nine thousand but then i thought you mentioned an additional amount okay so we have a short amount what 's the through reporting line okay sorry i i wasn 't included in my life i realized that but then i think you mentioned a figure of 250 and i thought oh does that mean we 've got the other one which is the that one but no okay so they 're still pending uh through the chair that was your priorities yes i realized i realized that but um it was just a comment you made i misinterpreters obviously um all right so i 'm happy very happy with that report um to pity we couldn 't get a bit higher in kind contribution for our arkston seems quite meager compared comment matter now i 'm happy to know that this report except thank you chancellor pastor people no nothing further another comment from this one put the recommendations over here page 114 counselors item 1407 water and sewer plant report the recommendation is that the item is received as information but i have someone to move that place council given some house of people thank you council forgiveness you wish to speak to the report could you unmute please council gibbons thank you i think to report just the damn shitty nicely thank you today why isn 't it okay nothing any other comments counsellors recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 116 counselors in 1408 monthly updates stats of council resolutions the recommendation is that report is received as information a mover please comes from the [Music] estimate of what we should expect it 's going to cost that 's good before you can do those things yes we are able to that yeah so um does the issue of the gas then fall within on page 119 within the terms of reference of this independent living units be handled by [Music] community services directly yeah so through the chair is an add-on that 's been raised certainly in the curtis street units because the gas from the new development runs straight past the units and through the acting community services director was formulated that well if it 's in that one we should at least investigate doing it throughout the whole of the units so we 're not going to have the same problem as we have with the gas contractor last time let 's hope not with the demarcation as to whose responsibility is to tap into the gasoline through the chair i think it 's a little bit different we know whose responsibility it will be and we 'll make it abundantly clear in any contract thank you um madame that 's i think that 's all i have thank you very much a lot of questions graves has been answered thank you and i 'm happy to meet this report now nothing really matters except to say that from time to time um i have a lot of other councils business trainers and i that anywhere and i think it is it 's a really useful feature that we have here and um you know i commend those involved for can you hear me because we can hear you thank you um i 'm just to 20th of july ordinary meeting about road naming and it 's more a question that the we 've got a new telephone book and there 's a map in the back and it actually doesn 't include a lot of the new roads that we have approved in the last four or five years now this may be a question that needs to go to the cma central mapping authority um can we be issued with a new map with all of our new subdivision name road names on it this i know this one we 're talking about it 's just a new a new subdivision but we 've had other subdivisions and they 're not on the map and i know it 's not council 's responsibility to um how can i say have much to do with the publication of the new phone book but got people coming to town and get the telephone and book the map 's useless because it hasn 't got everything on it i think we can bring that to the relevant organisations um notice councillor thank you thank you comments on this one council recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover council adoni thank you and i have a second account from the given from council dhoni um just what was it in the one we just looked at this uh earlier request for this machine kelly telly handler i 'm just wondering um how long before we may have access to that thank you for the chair um counselor daddy we um got some costumes on page 131 which goes 132 sort of machinery next page shows if we can get some good second-hand machinery thousand to a hundred thousand and the hiring of the machinery of the sixteen hundred dollars for two thousand dollars to win the budgetary situation to achieve through the chair you 've been securing a waste fund for quite some time in order to do of the old facility and the opening of the new facility as report but there is there is money within that fund to cater for a number of things as outlined in this report it just needs to be programmed in a way that it 's not used in one hit so in that sense we would be sensible to hire one for a period of time even though that 's firing 's very expensive before we committed to secondhand this type of machinery isn 't readily accessible so it would be one of those things that 's been programmed through um i think the technical services director and the planning director have had some conversations around being on the lookout for these types of things that that are available um if they need to bring a higher one in to start with then that may be the case but that 'll be how that will be how it 's addressed at this point lastly a little bit of general interest on those good to see the consolidation of things like tyres and mattresses we used to have someone who the steel but i don 't know if that 's possible anymore still yeah and are we going to avail ourselves of that for you and then the other one i don 't know if it 's yet feasible is uh is it winton that 's whacking in that energy hub no not waste of energy um solar between your energy and one of the one of the tasks they 're doing there is turning recycle tires back into diesel oil which is quite an exciting one i don 't know where they 're interested in ours but you know we so much waste of light along on a landscape sometimes so it 's good to see us getting up to speed with this report oh thank you um i 'm was just wondering are we expecting in november to have a report back providing us to the definitive costumes for the electricity um with the definitive costings of away bridge and the recommendation and costing as to whether we go new second hand or higher a telehandler slash front-end loader that 's the first question um through the chair to council november we 're waiting on um the final um costumes and uh um neither gave a consultation from the uh our energy uh consultants um once we 've received that we can finalize the report um the sorry single lane way bridge again uh continuing to gain or try and get the costings on um on the way bridge um the best costings we can get it based on providing the most power to the uh the waste facility as opposed to solar so we 've tried those to go hand in hand i would suspect uh being able to finalize the costumes for the weighbridge and the um so we 're looking at secondhand ones in relation to the waveridge or just knew the consultant who provided the report to council with sorry through the chair um indicated the costings that were provided uh would be a new new way bridge i 'll keep looking at that those costumes i 'm sorry castle on the third point sorry was the tiller handler slash front-end load um we 've got a are you going to come back to with a let 's say second hand um we 've managed to that 's going to pick one up for that 's i think it 's range of 60 to 100 000. so for those three issues we expect to be dealt with in november through the two correct yes okay sorry i 'll just um and and it 's good to see the progress that 's been made in relation to the items in two three two two on the bottom of page 127 through to 5 on 1 28 so i 'm happy to send this report management thank you councilman is there any other comments [Music] i thought the nose information was only the trailer yeah through the chair i think that that 's the trial may be required as part of that rental up front to see whether it is the best approach to to what they do okay that 's fine um a while ago um this uh anacond group were giving us a price for the power to go the tip have we got no price for men yet so yes we have got with the neighbors okay technical services director to add additional comment there yep technical services chris you 're on news my apologies yeah thanks madame um yeah just to clarify further to damian 's um commentary around the consultation with the property owner certainly uh is seeking interest in gaining easement across two private uh allotments uh that has been stymied obviously with covert and the ability to uh intercourse with the public health order for endicon on our behalf to do that um but we i have been following that up with um with anaconda in the importance of getting that price back because that certainly will impact what is reported back to council in the final costing uh should there be an agreement struck with both those property owners to facilitate power from rudders bridge road through to the uh the urban waste facility i hope that helps thank you really because um the seattle kong group is still carrying out their jobs they 've originally done some work the lithgow area i just can 't understand why they can 't anyway i i know things and this we probably need the 11 count thousand volts out there but a chat approached me the other day about the solar farm which is where our redundant waste when we finished filling it in i refer them to gary and they could be fire kickers i don 't know we used gasoline but we 've got to think about what they can offer if they give it a sight you know and i 'm pretty sure they 'll need the 11 kv line of food back into it if you forget what i mean not just 249 so i i i just i didn 't think everything stopped with go but that 's all i 'm sorry council i 'll try that is there any other comments your council 's on the club for the recommendation we 'll leave that harry dunamis thank you page 133 item 1410 road naming unnamed rose highland estate the recommendation is that report item is received for information can i have councillor gibbon and councilman thank you think the report speaks for itself obviously we 've had one name um changed by the naming way and um i commend the report thank you [Music] six is there one of the council 's secretarial staff was called elaine and snuck their name in there just say a name council rogue six is one of the council secretaries lane the answer that is no counsellor no i think that 's elven i think in case that 's the one we sent off to whoever the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 135 councillors item 16 there 's no urgent business this evening page 135 item six professional confidential reports in accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government general regulation 2005 in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kind as referred to in section 10a bracket two of the act and should be dealt with in part of the meeting close to the media and the public i 'd like to thank the members of the public for joining this evening and for those joining us on soon good night i 'm out call for a counsellor to move the council move into post session favour harry thank you i now request minute secretary secretary to turn off the reporting recording recommenced at 9 24 p.m following resolutions were made in pro session there were no

meeting the 30th of march 2021 folks councilman gives you a second to close just checking that you were there cable thank you any business arising councillors no business arising all in favor of the need to be accepted harry thank you host 13 counsellors reports item 0501 participation in the regional contract the supply and delivery of line marking services there 's a recommendation in three parts the council receive and note the information contained in report item 0.501 that council agreed to participate in a regional procurement process for line marking services but council have someone to move that please councilman kevin and christopher thank you councilman do you wish to speak to this i 'm thinking about amanda the report is fairly self-explanatory um the only question i would have is on page 15 where the joiner organization manages the process this is second last or third last paragraph pathologies about halfway down page 15 manages basis including all costs of advertising and typically receives a management fee from the service providers to cover these costs so does that mean whoever ends up winning the tender for this line marking services pays them a separate management fee or how does it work did you get a manager the contribution is paid by councils to centrock to mage these particular contracts not the other way because of uh participants providing a payment to the contract okay so should not the word service providers be changes in councils because the service providers that i as i understand the service providers who 's providing the loan marketing services that 's why i was confused right look certainly if um [Music] thank you council is there any just on the second last paragraph member councils have the opportunity to be involved in the procurement process um and then goes on to say that staff acting as a criminal of blainey cara orange parks and wedding councils have expressed interest is oberon council going to express interest or is there a reason that we 're not interested i just wondered what uh since the member councils have the opportunity to be involved um are we there or not well we 're not there i think there was a from memory and the general manager would confirm this a member of the panel of skye on the city and enable the councils to put their hand up and as far as i 'm aware overall but i 'll get some confirmation um that 's that 's correct um however it 's generally uh um there 's quite a number of these things where we sit on evaluation panels and generally shared around in this instance over the fire council expressed their interest in becoming the panel thank you that explains if you didn 't mention that there were five on this one come to us i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor thank you 16 councillors item 0502 trial line marking over on street there 's a recommendation in four parts the council trial the installation of painted line marking vehicle car parking spaces on the northern side of oberon street between ross street and the pedestrian crossing but that the trial be monitored for a six month period and a further report be provided it counts to council at the conclusion of the trial but subject to transport for new south wales approval council will install an additional accessible vehicle parking space on the northern side of oberon street adjacent to 135 over on street and that council should should approve will not be obtained from transport to new south wales a further report be provided to council indicating the reasons for the refusal do i have a movement for this one please counsel councillor paypal and cancer challenging kate would you wish to speak to this one thank you this is something that 's had a fairly long gestational period um there 's been the report um summarizes everything that 's happened and i think that the best way to find out whether having line markings on the road is um accept well won acceptable too worthwhile is to is to suck it and see that 's exactly what we 're doing i think the important thing here though two is the accessible parking spot that we 've had [Music] now 's the time to get on and do it i think as i say i think a trial is the best way to find out if this is all worthwhile and accessible to the community and uh yeah acceptable to the community thank you councilman uh i 've got nothing better than that thank you any other comments on this one comes with i 'm putting recommendations your attention there put to the vote um i was attempting to catch your attention about any other comment i i can clarify it um through other means that 's all right i was just uh when you said other counselors i was giving you multiple signals but uh obviously are not easy to see that against the motion i can clarify it um elsewhere okay council can i just say i can only see your head from your tune up if you could put your hand up sorry i was flying through the air [Music] an eye on the screen on my behalf thank you through the chair i thought i was there [Music] 0503 rural road rural road environmentally affected recommendation views in three parts the council allocate local roads and community infrastructure round three grant funding of one million one hundred and sixty nine thousand and twenty eight dollars to assist with road drainage improvement as outlined within the report but an amount of 586 thousand dollars be provided in the 2021-22 financial year to be allocated to road maintenance works listed in table 1 from lrci round 3 that the residual amount of 583 583 028 be provided during the 2223 financial year to be allocated to road maintenance work listed in table two during the june to december 2022 canada year from from lrci round three do i have a move of police councillors how 's on mccarthy do i expect road like when you look at drew 's road 160 000 which is a lot of money i understand when we went down there was just a few culverts to be added does that mean this is going to be sealed or what do we do or does that mean the big bike down the bottom involved in this or what um i think we need to be a bit more explaining and on the cardwood road the two kilometers it says here that we 've got five goldmans to go and is that correct um many years ago we allocated the council some money and we had a chat from um tamimba valley come through coles and i thought that 35 000 we allocated them was to do all the cold so that when we got money to do that road that we were had them done so why do they keep rick through the jury explain that um we 're talking about the other section of carl would run from where his mouth is we 're talking about the other section of cardwood road on the eastern side the five columns would be installed so you 're right you 're right in what you say in terms of the previous installation of culvers and extensions on the section between lowe 's mount road and the o 'connell road has been complete it 's the section that we 're focused on on the unsealed section between lowe 's mount road and hazelgrave road off the garden across snakes valley correct okay thank you thank you and i 'm sorry you can answer to also your dream question with relation to the five pipe comments there correct and one concrete box called which i 've tried to highlight there it 's a precast box called it okay i understand a bit more of it now it 's just a nice i 'm quite happy with this um strategy here which is allocating that one point uh six nine one point one six nine million dollars to our uh unsealed roads and particularly the the culverts um this is in line with the sorts of expenditure that the morrison low report aims at and i think the question that is begged normal baseline of income strong sources beyond the step of this two years i 'm through the chair that 's a question that future operational plans are going to have to answer [Music] what i can say is that based on that that documentary that you mentioned this gives a boost to our maintenance of function in areas where we know that we spend a significant amount of maintenance money now due to the issues that have been outlined in the report and previously by implementing a strategy such as this it minimises the continual take-up of maintenance money on these types of roads which therefore will allow us in the future to move that maintenance money into other localities around the local area we need to continue to be strategic about how we do that which is why over the next two financial years implementing this money gives significant boost to your maintenance fund without the need to recognize additional funding in those two financial years okay so your your expectation is that we will improve drainage across a whole variety of unsealed roads to the point where the correct it 's one of the number of strategies that we 're going to continue to address but i think it 's a pretty good one to start with thank you for that thank you madame yes when council mccartney moved this uh originally i was fully supported because and i think that um council staff and councils have been very much an agreement of trying to target our worst roads and see what we can do to stop the to reduce our current maintenance costs and as is being said by council kellerman the general manager um that 's been the aim and it looks as though that should be up should have that impact so that we can save the number of gradings for instance on each of those roads per year so it may go from five back to two um my only comments um is that i think it should be headed rural roads not road um and although i think as council as we all know that in two and three the amounts there add up to the total at the top i would have not um did not think that we had one point one six nine plus five eighty six and five eighty three just to say that the 586 was part of the one one six nine or recommendation one i i gave some proposed rewording to sharon and to others and the only other thing was i think the june to december 2022 in the in recommendation three we can 't really call that financial year it 's a six-month period through the chair just to give clarification yep um in two and three it 's indicated that two it 's from the lci round three right um in three it 's from the lci round three so that 's sufficient i note your concerns about june to december the fund makes councils spend the money between january 22 and december 22. so in order for the funding to in fact work in the two financial years as proposed half of it will be spent in the first from january to june in 2022 yes that 's right the second part will be spent in 2022 between june and december i to december 22 32 calendar year calendar year is 12 months so i don 't mind if we delete calendar year just take your calendar calendar year or put in the six months it 's it 's it 's just a yeah that was the only issue i i 'm happy that if we 're all happy lrci round three sufficient to make sure that that 's and those two amounts do add up to the 1.169 i agree um and as i said the only other issue was i think it should be roads environmentally effective that doesn 't affect the resolution though no um but no i 'm fully in support of this i thought the table one and table two with the legend if i can call it the legend about a third of the way down page 27 was very clear i note that and i do hope that the work on for instance ball ridge road with the culverts and schumacher 's road in particular which are in a particularly bad state at the moment will significantly reduce our maintenance requirements on those roads because schumacher 's road is in atrocious condition at the moment i know a lot of roads are but in fact someone suggested to me the other day it should be closed it isn 't such and if anyone drove a car over they didn 't do do certain area if they went too fast they 'd break an axle i know that there may have been some work in the last week thank you councillor i 'm sorry can i just just before the director speaks council mccarthy and councillor callum have you got any objection to taking out calendar year from that resolution thank you through the director yeah thanks madam mayor i just wanted to clarify paul ridge road there on page 28 uh you may have picked up that that um some appropriately if you take into my legend of eighty thousand dollars i 've actually just allocated forty thousand dollars per per boxcast um um because they are smaller culverts on that road and being three of um we 've allocated forty thousand dollars it was just something i probably should have put in that legend calculation so it provides further understanding but just for your information any other comments come through just counselor doni thank you madam me are you able to hear me now ah thank you are you able to hear me yes thank you um uh i i recommend the uh the report response that 's been developed the floor of the chamber and by the staff i think it 's a couple of questions one i like the flexibility that we 're not um looking to seal everything that that 's there and therefore give us ourselves a greater maintenance um impulse into the future um so i 'm hoping that we will actually find that those key spots that need sealing are minimized um i thank councillor kellum for clarifying the point that i think should have been in the report that this intent is actually to it was by inference but i don 't think directly that this intent is to reduce the maintenance a bill um when this period 's over that the the maintenance on these roads will actually save us money into uh the next medium was the key element but we have that old thing our roads matrix and i wonder in some of these roads such as phil 's falls i look at phil 's falls and i compare that to maybe bosworth or bloom hill on the level of traffic did the roads matrix have any bearing on the amount of money we 're willing to spend on some of these unsealed roads or is it simply uh environmental issues through the tube um completely separate as you just described obviously you 're addressing environmental concerns from gradient and highly erased countries as opposed to the bitumen ceiling of one to two kilometers per year matrix which identifies more the volume and type of traffic and development and i like so very hard to integrate them put it that way again sticking to the motion of environmentally affected is really what we 're talking about even to that extent where bitumen seals being applied to sections of some of those unsealed roads it 's not the entirety of course but just again addressing the gradients and the worst sections that are more susceptible you so if we are not really applying the um the road matrix which is different from our intention of sealing uh um uh um certain kilometers each year road matrix was based on intensity of of use as well i 'm just want to be assured that any sum of road that we any sum of money that we spend on one of these road projects which is quite significant is um is a wise expenditure of money on the amount of traffic that that road receives uh we 're going through the chair just going back to the affected components really about getting these roads um which is probably the number one enemy which creates the damage so i 'm sort of again in this report just addressing the environmentally component environmental component more so than you know other road networks which are conducive to carrying more nuclear traffic and varying types of traffic and development in the life where that one to two kilometers per year was really addressed roads and providing uh bitumen this is more addressing and an aim of reducing uh as clarified um know councils having to put their hand in the pocket i suppose of uh you know again the morris and the lowe 's recommendation of that additional three hundred thousand dollars per annum so it 's uh again a strategy around that um to uh to to reduce the ongoing uh component in that area of maintenance that makes sense thank you thank you madam me mr daniel just draw your attention to page 30 yes gives you the answer to your first question about reducing future maintenance at the same time as this okay okay apologies thank you mccarthy yes um when we 're doing this road maintenance till we monitor who 's doing the actual trading for which crews doing the grade in respect the local farmer told me that big road was graded in 2016 and it had no work done until recently and then it was done flat hence with the local weather it 's nearly new storm again what i 'm getting at is it had a crown in the road and then the greater operator decided the crown wasn 't needed and took it the right work or should we be starting to do it in other words if someone 's not doing it quite right does it make the frequency required to grade it more through the chair that certainly could have a an impulse on the requirement too great more frequent that 's correct um i would expect that our operators are all experienced enough to be able to you know address the different varying types of terrain and again referencing to your crowning on the road where applicable okay but certainly there 's a concern i would suggest that the opponent or the the property owner that is of concern uh raise that with uh you know present with us and engineers and uh we 'll take it to task and review it page 31 item item 504 practical works program progress update 2021-22 the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have mover please counsel mckinnon and a secondary thank you very much it 's an extensive report um and i think the gantt chart shows clearly the extent of the capital works program which the council um i did have a question and the general manager may have responded but i have not had a chance to make emails on item 48.49 the newest sewer plant project rft which i 'm assuming is the press contender um i know it goes from the 11th of october 21 to the 25th of november 22. i wouldn 't thought the rft would have taken that long to be prepared it does say rft when the award of the project on item 49 of the gantt chart looks as though it 's going to occur in january and is that the date that we anticipate a contract for the detailed design and for the construction to be awarded if so i would have thought that it 's incorrect for the rft to go in for such a long period of time because the rft would be issued there would be a period in which the contractors would be getting their tinder together and then they would be submitting it back to us we would be evaluating it there would be an evaluation period and then there would should be broken down into more elements because i 'm not understanding it but from the box there yeah through the chair certainly that will be the case at this stage it 's indeed evolved the time frames around funding in life for that to come to fruition with regard to the documents and that aligning but you 're right this is dynamic this will change no doubt about that and i 'm still hoping that it may be the case we 'll come forward uh i 've got first case with chancellor elections and alike i 'm just cognizant of many variables in that space so um again this is just not locked in totally at this stage it 's it 's just floating at the minute but with but with respect the rft period which is the request for tender has a period spanning over a year and then you 've got an award and construction over on tv which i would have thought was the award of the contract in january 22. so how can you have the rft process extending beyond the award of the contract rft the contract that the people you issue it to have a period two or three months to get their tender together i think we talked about a month that might have stayed it might be a bit longer to get the tenor together and they submit it back to us by a certain date we have an evaluation panel that evaluates and they come up and after we 've then we have might have some contract negotiations and then we sign the contract that 's correct so i don 't think this reflects that process even though if it might be flexible this is not reflecting that process and it will so so through this year certainly will reflect that process as more information comes to him when the rft is done subject to that that funding uh mechanisms then i will certainly make sure this is renowned and reissued at that time to reflect exactly the time frames that 's going to be allowed right madam subject to that comment i 'm happy to recommend this reporters and i think it 's a very good way for us an excellent report um um with this great lot of capital works taking place in various areas such as treatment plants and serious treatment plants and roads um what is is there uh manageable stress on staff resources and uh and also the availability of contractors or a lot of the very good question and the answer to that question is it 's um monitored we understand that there will be a number of things that we are looking to put in place in fact the engineering staff are looking to looking to assist in evaluating some some of our current employees acumen by putting in [Music] promote like having overseers we call them team leaders for specific projects so that there is a level on the ground that we can look at every day to assist the project manager and delivering projects there absolutely will be needed there will be need for engagement with contractors to assist in the delivery of these projects and in the in the space where unique and essential mindsets are required or skill sets are required to fill these roles we 'll be looking council just a clarification from lots of general managers you 're looking to get support staff and contractors are you looking to still only work in eight hour days to get some of this work done or are you going to work extended days and we 'll go to flexi 's because those things with moon until road has it been convinced yeah so so through the chair i 'll answer the first one and let chris answer the capital works um we 're looking to extend work hours where we need to to get best bang for buck out of time and especially distance away from the from the depots so having guys on site at um normal at additional hours is going to be one of those processes we 've been a little delight on that due to absences to key absences which we 've now got resolved and uh but the weather 's now turning against us but we 're ready to go we 've got everything in place all our materials are organized so i would anticipate we 'll get a start this week sometime since we just keep pushing through on extended air as until we get should we get the thing completed okay please don 't blame the weather the money for that job was there available in july wouldn 't it yeah so please don 't blame the weather certainly snow events and everything i realized that like so the resourcing is the key element i think it repeated uh sort of the technical terms that managers referring to and again we have consulted with staff about the longer hours and daylight savings of course is here now uh that may be 6 30 starts and uh you know seven o 'clock finishes if that 'd be the case on saturday so yes we are looking to maximize that and including rdos and possibly even some weekend where i give that uh again if the weather permits so the the bureau of meteorology i think as i 've reiterated the council has confirmed a wetter than average uh spring and summer period so we just we can 't help what we 're given uh but we 'll certainly work to our best to no other comments councillors i 'm putting the record putting the recommendation all you couldn 't be regretting for the greatest respect page 38 councillors um i 'm proposing to bring item seven forward general business which allows the uh viewing public to to hear the discussion can i have someone to move that item seven before forward please because that 's capable and council mccarthy thank you thank you general business counselors any general business council between the crown road reserve and the dedicated road down the byram 's which is down off the registry give all the councils a bit of enough data requested and on the extensive conversation with gary and i appreciate it on friday i went back and done some more research there 's roughly 60 metres missing the road and that is so the crown road sorry the counter road that 's there now meets the paper road that goes to the river and unless that link is in play byron won 't be able to go to the lands board and get a closure on that road and gary i 'll tell you river but when you 're going to lodge something to close the road you go up against the fishermen and all they say is we object this link needs to be there so that the council road connects to the paper road and the road that goes through byron 's which is trying to close don 't even understood there 's two other things here there 's the paper road that goes past byram 's house and there 's a writer carriageway they 're his problems and he 's got to sort that out but we need this 60 meter link that 's in between the council road the panel is a copy and [Music] it was agreed to back in 2001 yes sorry ken wasn 't the same one thank you wrong this is when ghana thought need to just get that 60 meters done and get it out of the road so byron could get on you know you can go back and forward back and forth whatever but if anyone 's ever been involved in a road closure you get all these people objecting to it and constructed road that chris mcewen put in in other words when had a subdivision down uh not bored chris mcewen had a subdivision down there byron 's objected and chris mcewen said i 'll move the road away from your house which he did and that was on a crown road and now it 's become a pencil road the other ones that are down here in the corner one 's a paper road which is there and the others are uh what a kill they 're byron 's problems we just need this 56.88 metres for road to link the council road to the paper road and then the road that 's in the bottom here thing that is where the fishermen will say we want access to the river and that 's what 's i agreed with gary what have you done the other day and then i went back researched another one that i knew about and that 's what happens i just say no because box access so if we don 't link that together byron we 'll never be able to get the paper road we agreed to in 2001 to do that section or ask what can 't council do is that 's great yeah i cannot get a comment please um in terms of the information that 's been provided that um council would undertake some type of road assessment from this letter we 've had evidence to suggest that that is a continuation um i talk to both our legal person who represents us and byron 's and talked about this matter and the matter relating to the leaking of the of the paper road is one that is is new to me on the basis of what or what council mccabe is saying in terms of the fishermen not having access my only comment to that would be the the access to the river could be via we we already are looking to put a culvert over drew 's road which would access the river so so this is not um this is not access you can drive on oh we understand that this is just a legal access that the fishermen say we have the right to walk down there be on that paper road but yeah look lots of it you can 't and there 's actually paper aids you can 't traverse but they 're there but if we don 't support this small bit of road byron 's won 't be able to close the paper road in between there because of the based on that because council mccarthy and i did have a conversation about this last week and if he 's provided additional information i 'm more than happy to engage with the byram 's and our legal team to to be able to sort this out and i think it 's a huge issue where it comes you know and i 'm more than happy to take that on notice and try and get a resolution to that just we need to complete our feast the problem with firearms create themselves they allow some people to come on a rider carriage where they didn 't have to they listen to a bloody simply looking real estate that 's their problem i i won 't go down that path that admitted by real estate agents more than happy to discuss this with with our representatives purely on the basis that um it traverses the byron 's land and if the bombs want to continue on with that process then at the end of the day we resolve that we were going to assist in doing this and i 'm i 'm happy to assist good and the people in charge of roads is there any other councils here maggie stevenson and um gutshot evans and all them and they complained about the roads through their place and then the flight from the government left led loose and said that you don 't own that ground and made it perfectly clear that people can walk along their ground at any time that they like anyway i thought you might have mentioned it as far as this piece of general business is concerned the general managers agreed to liaise with this environment take this on i know that we 're fully taxed with our equipment supplies but is there any update on when on the dog rocks road the campus river at the campbells river that the side of that bridge removed at least i probably have an email a couple of weeks from the manager of bryant park then through the two years i realized we need an excavator and we don 't want to send one down there on a single job certainly hasn 't gone off our radar um i think that certainly in the next two three weeks i 'm hoping to that be the case i have spoken with the uh the overseas and relation to be able to maybe free up a machine if i can 't do that then i will be also looking at other fraternity-sized contractors that may be able to help us out in that area so i will stay in touch with you regarding that got your emails thank you yeah okay thank you and if i could manage that couple of questions the two bridges on the triangle flat edge sorry where the triangle creek crosses just before the bat is bound we were at the bathurst boundary and the gilman diet creek across just through the lanakuri entrance um have those both those bridges the logging trucks and beat office when this borrower road has been upgrade is being upgraded no would be the answer in simplicity at this stage um however yes we could look at those or would they be i was assuming if we 're upgrading the road we have to assess what weight capacities our bridges can take correct yes and i don 't have that information so i can certainly take that same the one at judd 's creek i 'm assuming too uh it could be a number of bridges that needed to be assessed let 's go with that so if should we seek an application then yes we can review that um certainly review that on the basis of their capacity of the vehicles that are wishing to do that but in the interim i can certainly look up that and have that discussion well i 'm just wondering because i mean you saw us that it 'll be suitable for b doubles and i want to make sure that we 're not stymied by the bridge capacities and also we don 't want to upgrade the bridges can 't take the trucks you know it 's yeah and they 'll be traveling i 'm assuming both ways they 'll also be traveling to bathurst on that road the technical services manager does get lot of applications through the nhvr i 'm i 'm not asking you to do it as an isolated thing but i would have thought it would be done as part of the of the project for boriga road i 'm not going to say go out now and assess them all i 'm saying is part of this project for the upgrade of the burrica road which we 've been allocated a number i would have thought we need to do a proper assessment on those bridges to ensure what capacities they have so through the chair also i suppose saying is fact um yes the capacities are certainly going to be the limiting factor on those particular applications so whether they 're double decker or tingle uh type b doubles that 's probably where i 'm coming from so we can have that discussion right the next thing is with 'm a little uncertain as to how far down archstone road that 's going um is that from where to where um six kilometers long from the campbells river road so where does that take it down to uh pretty much to the work that was last on that midsection so that 's just from recollection that hold me to it but here certainly around about that so it 's part of our stone road was done with in the current campbell 's river barringer road arcstone road so this will be the next section going south i suppose it is yeah southeast sorry yeah so that 'll be the next section going southeast that 'll be six kilometers from there is that right from the intersection of pennsylvania that 's correct so how far down does that take it i 'm just trying to think what 's the closest intersection uh i just don 't have one on the top of my head on all right well i 'll i 'll just do it just to so that we know um it doesn 't go obviously down in the that so there was some recent work that when i say recently probably about three years ago that we 've done an upgrade mid section where the road wasn 't a really bad state i remember that that 's why it does take us to around about that point um from from my recollection but i can 't confirm yeah not about emergency but just when you have a chance to look at it um i 'm just just interested all right any only matters to ray thank you man if there 's no other general business i 'm 39 overstreet could the works manager give us a date update on what 's the progress like that or is there a report come back to council crossing from the bottom yes um yeah the uh he 's had a number of discussions with me regarding uh access [Music] um she has been referred to the rta um transport new south wales these days um because involves involved in marine growth um transport have indicated that they would have no objection to them to the driveway being constructed however there 's issue with regard to the stone wall how far you would you would have to move it uphill um it has been suggested to the [Music] council because it 's a private entrance technically it 's it 's nothing to do with council it 's it 's to do with the property and if the property owner wants to improve the access and property owner has indicated they 're willing to contribute seven thousand dollars towards the cost of the job when they 're the beneficiary of a driveway um they should be not paying for it oh i agree i i spoke to peter the other day but yeah i 'm happy that that 's not what they wanted well they want the rock wall cut down but how long has this been going for because it 's been going back and forth and they 've been to poor pool contribute towards it there 's going to be some excessive costs there no doubt utilities and power is another one that come to mind when i looked at it yesterday certainly the cabling through there the water main is 's the modification of the ball can i ask have they officially applied to council to pay partial part of this no so then that 's when we should be discussing it but it 's festering back and forth back and forth yeah but then but the application they run off to paul till and paul tool says they 've got plenty of money here that they can take it out of this place and then they need to apply to council council okay well how long how long have we had the applications we haven 't had an application but i 'll just reiterate it 's the benefit of them i i don 't get any access they if they want to modify it and look i can 't see why they can 't but certainly seven thousand dollars is going to be a far cry from what 's going to cost i would be thinking somewhere between 20 and 30 grand that 's like on a desktop so just so just in terms of sorry have we responded to these to the could i suggest that we refer council 's not a bit in a position to contribute and for a whole host of reasons sort of set up question please stop it i think we need to actually receive an application first all right that would and that would then be the response yeah and okay and my understanding is that based on what you both just said is that the reason why they haven 't is because they already know the answer yeah i 'll contact example do i have to disclose a declaration of interest and that i had to put a water bone at my expense under the road because it was going through the culvert and then bitumen from spain so i i have no sympathy for them we 're now going to move into um closed session so it 's page 38 item six closed session confidential report in accordance with the local

up belong a road sorry council um can i have someone to move the motion please motion is that counsel from section 94 rural roads provide funds to widen 200 metres of roadway on foga baloga road near property 234 mccarthy is there a secondary councillor lion thank you council mccarthy would you like to speak to the motion yes madam mayor as you come up from the uh west uh our excavator driver had been digging into the bank and made the road quite wide when it comes up to this last 200 metres um it needs widening to the north it 's a pinch point it 's a brow of a hill um the rest of the roads in pretty good visual condition so you can see an oncoming car or whatever so i 'd like to see this 200 meters widen use the possibly the use of a training thing there are only small trees that have need to be taken out if we go on the northern side and one of the things with foga bola road if there 's an accident between over and this intersection on the o 'connell road the traffic 's converted up diverted up frogabola road so we need this pinch point gone it 's like i said the brow the hill there are only small trees if we take it works needs to be done at all if any all i mean is to take two meters of the trees out and widen the road i think it can be done today quite easy thank you thank you councillor council lion if it improves a dangerous section which could be dangerous i second it thank you any comments on this one counselor 's close counselor johnny madame thank you um i 'm quite happy with it i would just like a word from technical services as to the estimate of the cost and how realistic that is through you to the technical services director uh yeah thank you madam mayor uh look it 's something that i 'd certainly have to uh review click on notice at this stage and uh report back to council okay is it a work of such significant nature that we need to wait for that report or we can just let it go through that 's i guess another way of asking the same question uh through the chair look yeah certainly i again i think i 'd like to have the opportunity to back gay a report in relation to uh what that cost could be thank you thank you any other comments counsellors the general manager through the chair just taking that point on board potentially council could consider um if the works were under five thousand dollars to do them if they were over five thousand to bring a report back to expediate the works if that 's what council 's intention may be so are you saying that the um the director of technical services will assess that job if it 's under five thousand dollars it can be done and if it 's over five thousand dollars it should be a report is that what you 're saying that would buy that would be my um commentary given council of dani 's comments right council mccarthy this is this is your motion and that sounds like an amendment to it i 'm back to you well i 'm happy for that action but um i thought i had the director out there with me and i showed him the small amount of timber but um maybe it never gelled get a result so would you like to amend the wording of your motion counselor yes if you like i 'll leave in your hands okay the council from section 94 rural roads provide funds to widen 200 metres of roadway on foga blogger road near the property the director will assess the cost of the job if it 's under five thousand dollars it should be carried out if it 's over five thousand dollars of report be brought back to council that 's fine but fine by me thank you sharon did you get that [Music] all right um i 'll share it now madam thank you happy with that council mccarthy and councillor lyon as well please yes any other comments on this one counselors please i can 't see the screen at the moment any other comments on this one councillors councillor humans yes through the chair i think this is a very good initiative to make these rural roads as council mccarthy said it can be a road that can be used if something happens our main road to o 'connell and uh it 's thank you councillor any other comments before i put the recommendation counsellors i 'm putting the recommendation all in favor harry thank you item 1003 request to widen section of black bullock road the motion is that council look at widening black bullock road between the walking path slash rail line to the east to fitzpatrick 's clear ground bracket used for extension of existing trail to be funded from section 94 rural roads a move the place council mccarthy and a secondary place now so downey council mccarthy um madam mayor i 'm happy to have a report come back by the um uh director of engineering there 's a fair amount of earth works to be done um but with the participation in people using push bikes people walking on this trail they call it the triangle they go out along the lowest mount walking track cut across black bullet and come in the hazel grove road and i think this part in there needs whiting it 's a very narrow section not very long but it requires a fair bit of earthworks in respect the removal of then level on the other so it might require a report back from the director before we do any more on this are you happy to put a 0.2 in there that 'll report to come back to council yes happy there thank you i think as a second and madame i think it 's there says that council look at widening sorry councillor i miss that i can 't hear you i so as the second out i think it 's already in the motion the the motion reads that council look at widening black bullock road look at widening is bring back a report to me so you don 't feel bring back a report is necessary counselor mccarthy i i 'm happy with whatever goes as soon as we get some accident on this council dhoni would be happy to sit as it is all i am thank you any other comment on this one counselor it 's council donald do you wish to comment on the motion i 'm happy with it any other comments counselors before i put the recommendation put the

southern lights project um is there any uh or what has there been any talk about the proposed timeline or date for uh the um upgrading the oberon local government area 2122 i believe i 'll confirm with the general manager 2122 they are ahead of schedule though so it may come a little bit earlier uh thank you thank you councilman uh thank you madame um seems an active meeting i was interested to see the support we 're getting from penrith council and others for a swift link over over the mountains obviously that 's of interest um if you 're postal voting for the next local elections um it will be available but the exact sale of it is uh seems to uh get interesting from a number of perspectives thank you councillor any other comments counsellors i 'm putting the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 25 counselors item 1102 upper macquarie county council meeting 19th of june 2020 the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover

being very active in a number of areas all the covert issues thank you councilwood council cable um nothing further thank you madam mayor a comprehensive report as always from the open arts council thank you thank you any other comments on this one councillors put the recommendation all in favor carried thank you page 33 item 1104 councillors central new south wales joint organization special board meeting third of july 2020 the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have someone to move that way please councilman cuban and councillor capel thank you councilman kevin um thank you madame the necessity they 're also interesting to note that there were some concerns about job keeper and job seeker and some of those um have come up recently i think with um in fact today the political um uh comments about what 's to occur with those going forward um as there have been i think comments that people are actually receiving more money uh from job keeper or job seeker than programs being introduced thank you madame thank you councillor councillor k paul thank you madam mayor thank you madame again a comprehensive report and nothing further to add thank you thank you council johnny thank you madam mayor um just i 've seen it in a few places but this expected agricultural labor shortage of um [Music] here 's just 21 000 people and we 've had some recent experience of um of filling that labor gap in you know in our own community um in recent times in jobs that you know people may not be keen to do to bring folk from overseas but just it just strikes me i think it 's a real concern that there is that level of labor shortage in um in in particular the horticultural industry and i 'm not sure really what we 're going to do about it at the moment because the two main sources are perhaps unavailable to us backpackers and short-term migrants it 's a very difficult position thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors that 's mccarthy supply of labor but what we we get some of the people out of that um sandstone block to come out here and fulfill those um vacancies that maybe give them a new start and a new perspective they could go home weekends but you try and get a job simple jobs done now like fencing everyone 's that flat out it 's it 's unbelievable but um yeah if you 're going to stay and looking look for jobs in a market that 's already saturated with people you won 't find a job but there 's plenty out here and maybe we could maybe provide accommodation and they come out here for the five days and then go home weekends if that and use the australian people that are out of work but anyway i support what councilman says thank you councillor happy to take that on board when we have the meeting with the um with the minister any other comments counsellors put the recommendation all in favor harry thank you committee reports councillors page 36 item 1201 over on youth council the recommendation is that the report be received as information can you and council mccarthy councillor capel thank you madam mayor thank you um yes an active meeting at the youth council the last meeting we had and they 're keen to get moving on something or other under very difficult circumstances it 's going to be tough for them to achieve the things that they want to do but i think they 're um ready to have a go a really active group i think that we have coming on board now thank you councillor council mccarthy yes madam mayor it 's good to see malcolm vaughn and still in there and even though he 's got an apprenticeship and it 's good to see the one of the actions on page 38 the open air cinema maybe we can facilitate that down above the skate park in the very near future thank you councillor that 's a good suggestion any other comments on this one councillors put the recommendation all in paper carrie thank you reports for decision counsellors page 39 item 1301 202021 operational plan and long-term financial plan and 2020-21 statement of revenue policy there is a to look for a second or i 'm going to move that we deal with item one item two and then items three to five separately if i can find a seconder for that council kellum thank you all in favor thank you we go then to item one the recommendation is that council adopt the 2020-21 operational plan and long-term financial plan as submitted do i have a mover please counsel mccallum councillor kellum sorry and a second of police councillor dhoni thank you councillor callum you want to speak you 'd like to speak to the recommendation thank you madam mayor i support the recommendation as presented in the business paper in presenting my arguments for this support i will also need to reference the motion passed at the june council meeting regarding rates and spending my first point is that this council 's achieved a sustainable financial position through the use of the special rates variation if we then seek to erode that position immediately after the srv finished that would be phil hardy at the meeting at the meet the candidate event back in august 2017 that the threat of amalgamation had not gone away and that the best defense against a future amalgamation attempt was a sustainable and robust finance sorry councillor callum you 've frozen could you repeat your last statement counselor you froze certainly madam mayor that sustainable and robust financial position has been achieved through the special rate variation process the rate peg of 2.6 is the level that the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal has judged to be reasonable to maintain that financial position weakening our finance position at the very first opportunity after the srv has finished which shall lack a foresight to the likely consequences in future years with reference to the motion passed at the june meeting the general manager was required to present a report providing potential savings of some 166 thousand dollars that figure would be the is the amount that would be full gone if there was no rate increase versus the 2.6 approved rate increase this hundred and sixty cut thousand dollars in savings could not be sourced from roads and as water and sewer are both self-funding those activities are also excluded that 20 of our budget and that is the community services area the report highlights those areas that will be affected virtually every school every sporting organisation every service club the rsl the rfs the oberon show the village improvement funds and every community event except banzac day is significantly affected the individual amounts of money may be quite small but they are very significant to the organizations involved and significant to the community as a whole that savings target also requires that a youth coordinator position be canned a position which the community felt strongly about and has been funded a member of the community suggested that the council cease advertising jobs development applications and other council information in the oberon review to save fourteen thousand dollars this would be a highly counter productive move especially in an era where rural newspapers are under such stress in my view all these potential savings are unnecessary and unacceptable the world learned in the 1930s that spending cuts and job restrictions only worsen any economic downturn the only sensible way out of any depression or or recession is for governments federal federal what we can at the local level the 2.6 rate increase allows us to continue to maintain our age our trajectory of a financial of financial sustainability to continue to fund the community to the expected level and have a deficit of less than 0.05 percent of our budget or 47 thousand dollars thank you thank you councillor councillor dhoni um thank you madam me um and could i thank councillor kellum for his detailed discussion uh i 'm a little bit broader uh i have been thinking about this as all of us have for some time and if i may report repeat a couple of key elements this is no level of government in australia is withdrawing its contribution to community economic uh well-being at this time and i think that would be very unwise and short-term for us to consider doing that as well as councillor kellum pointed out there 's a fairly narrow range it 's either community grants or jobs and i don 't think either of those moves are acceptable at this point in time we would be as a body in an exceptionally just a bit of the lures thing running for the car for the mayfield road i think 47 000 as a projected projected deficit is not a high risk decision although we don 't really know what the future holds but you know we are a governing body and we will do what is necessary but 47 is not much at all um i i i do have some concern that it will increase costs for some businesses but i don 't have an easy answer for that and i 'm just checking this counsellor remuneration one i have repeatedly over the years been happy to forego the council of remuneration and thought that was an important symbolic um if not wholly practical but symbolic decision you know most of us here all of us here wouldn 't do this job for the money however having looked at a table of how often we 've done it i sort of feel we 're almost getting to the point where we 're devaluing it maybe not for us but for for the future so um having wrestled with all this issue support uh this operational plan and long-term financial plan um as submitted that has my support thank you councillor johnny comments councillors councilman mckibben um thank you madame i 'm not sure if it 's my unstable internet connection or others i have had some problems hearing people including um deputy mayor uh kellum with his proposal um as i said i 'm not sure if it 's an unstable internet connection here or elsewhere um as councillors are aware um i propose that we forego the 2.6 a rate peg increase at the pre previous meeting i have looked at the savings proposed by the general manager um and i 'm not sure that they 're all the possible savings that can be made um and i think greater and more in-depth um inquiry into that is probably warranted however i do believe that and and we will see um and i can 't obviously refer to confidential issues but i can say that a number of our businesses are having a hard time generally and an increase in rates of 2.6 percent will cause continued hardship um we what council of dhoni was saying in regard to foregoing the increasing council of fees um we have been doing it quite often however we are a small council um and i for one believe that in this current circumstances we should forego an increase in council of fees ideally i would ask for it for there to be no increase in rates having looked at the savings and the amounts proposed by the general manager i 'm a little uncertain as to some of them including i 'm not sure what the for instance the 15 thousand in weed spraying you spin on i 'm assuming it 's in addition to what the upper macquarie does and it may be within town limits or something there 's not a lot of detail there um but i believe that we should be only increasing rates by 1.5 percent and i would be putting an amendment to that effect that the town improvement levy and the general rates increased by a rate peg of 1.5 that 's the proposed amendment to um uh resolution one the reasoning being that i believe number in our community hurting especially with what 's happening covert wise uncertain about job prospects or future employment as of today not knowing what the job keeper and job seeker is going to do they 'll have reduced amounts being paid to them if they are under those programs and continue to be unemployed and i think we need to do something to show that we are understanding that our community is hurting thank you madam ma 'am thank you councilman mckibben and so you are now proposing an amendment is that correct i i am proposing an amendment matter man okay could you give sharon your amendment please the amendment would be that for 2021 rates be increased by 1.5 percent on general rates and town improvement net levy and that the general manager within the savings prop outlined the payment this is the second point uh provide savings of ninety six thousand four hundred and seventy seven i think there was twenty two thousand roughly twenty two thousand one hundred and what ten proposed now can i have your amendment first because we need a second before give the details the savings management okay no right can you put up the amendment sharon and so councilman cuban can look at it or you didn 't get it sorry i can 't hear you sharon i don 't have it all i 'm sorry i missed the amount that he was talking about the proposed um dollars savings that the general manager is to provide 90s 96 we didn 't get it can 't help that matter 96 477 i think 96 volts in the report madame should i get in the car and drive driver on if this that 's your choice counselor well i 'll be away for half 40 minutes to get there that 's the problem would you put it up on the screen sharon when you said councilman cuban can check council mckibben is that your amendment yes but we can 't_''_2632.079 adopt the long-term financial plan is submitted because won 't there be a change to it as a result of this i would think so proposed thank you councilman cuban councilman kevin is that are you happy with that amendment he you are counsellors is there a second of councillor mckibben 's amendment council mccarthy do you wish to speak further to the amendment councillor get mickey ben no matter mayor i believe i 've already spoken to thank you councillor mccarthy yes madame um i believe there are savings that could be made and one was the fitness centre we were proposed that it was a card entry and a membership requirement now it 's a supervision thing that 's going to cost us in around 75 000 a year to maintain that that was never the proposal it was put to us when the fitness center was first put there there 's 75 000 that could be saved straight away so i 'm sorry but i don 't think the general managers had a good look at some savings and i take the broken pipe at the depot the other day that required five men to fix the damn thing over several days there are savings that we can make the general manager like to respond because i don 't believe that 's correct information about the fitness centre a managed trust with ymca ymca run the run the pool and currently we 'll run the fitness center it 's it 's their operation we will go to tender with an operational with an operational opportunity in the very near future and if savings are provided in that then we will certainly advise council that that 's not the case you the general manager i haven 't made a mayor i haven 't got amnesia the original proposal put to us for the fitness center when we first started with a budget 177 000 when shane wilson was here that it was to be you had to be a member by a card and it was card entry into the gymnasium i 'm sorry that that 's that 's how it was proposed to me councillor could that be before we um let out the contract for ymca to come in and manage that that 's right that 's great that changed the whole scenario that that 's correct madam mayor but that 's what i 'm saying is that we have these things that we 're told by anything and all of a sudden there 's 75 000 and managing this center it 's a cost to the community there are savings that can be made through the chair this process was a process that was approved by council not by the general manager yeah anyway i 'm not going to argue with you tonight but as councillor callum said if we didn 't change what we were doing it was going to be an embarrassment to the council but the original one was 177 000 for the fitness centre and when shane put it up to us it was a card entry and you had to be a member so it was under ct supervision now it 's got to be supervised which is putting the cost out there i 'm sorry but that 's just one one saving we could have made thank you council mccarthy is there any other comments counsellors on the amendment council capable thank you madam mayor i 'd like to speak against the amendment and in favor of the motion i like everybody else have um given a lot of thought the um the services that we provide to residents ratepayers people who live in this local government area are most important the residents if we start it doesn 't matter whether we are cutting whether we 're saving 166 000 or 40 000 or whatever we are going to have to cut back services to the community the amount of um increase in rates that will be brought about by two six two point six percent rise individually really doesn 't amount to very much i think i said last month that it will mean about fifty four dollars to us it will i imagine that we would probably be fairly average on the size of the amount of rates that we pay here at our place dollars is pretty hard to come by if um if you haven 't got a job or if things are tough i realize that but most people in this local government area fortunately are not doing it all that tough i know that that there are some who are and council has been in a position to assist those people we later on that i think the we 've we 've waived interest rates on on rates that people in difficulty are having um i think that we need to uh we need to put the two-point stick the 2.6 i 'm sorry um just remember that the services are are the most important thing to to the residents of this community we provide a lot of good services here and we will be going backwards at a great rate if if we don 't continue to do that um thank you thank you councillor cable is there any other comment i 'll come back to you councilman kevin is there any other comment i would like to skip against the amendment um for the reasons that i 've heard here tonight as from some of the councillors i also think that as a council it 's incumbent upon us to provide services to our community it 's a community that puts great store by those services we have initiatives in place for anybody that may be suffering hardship through their rates i think it 's quite a generous um a generous scheme with the corporate services director there are has been little or no increase in rate payers not being able to pay their rates and little or no uptake of the hardship policy i 've talked to many people within the community and the general feeling that i 've been getting back is that everything 's going up we expect our rates to go up and 2.6 is not a huge amount don 't take our services away on on that basis i would vote against that amendment anything else councillors councilman kibben thank you madam mayor um obviously we 're talking to different people because people are acutely aware that i speak to about the rates um and how high they are and what impact it 's having on businesses so we 're obviously talking to people i realize that in a number of cases this will not have a huge financial reduction in the amount the others would be paying but at least it 's showing some genuineness by council to realizing that our businesses are having a hard time i 've heard some of the comments here and what is being proposed under the original motion we have you know we have increased or it was decided to increase the amounts we offered for three five six grams which as you know i was not in support of this has increased substantially the amount that we 're giving to our organizations which is fine but you know we just we 're a small council and we have um a small number of ratepayers and those ratepayers are bearing um those ratepayers who have businesses i believe are bearing unreasonable amount of the rate burden for the services i can 't say it anymore and oberon does not have a high real estate market for houses such as bathurst or orange and one can argue that the rate factor on residential and rural residential is higher than on farmland etc but oberon has a situation where houses in the town are valued relatively cheaply and farmland surrounding it is valued relatively highly um and so our primary production enterprises and our some of our businesses are paying a high percentage of the total rate pool um because the value can 't which they can 't do anything about because the valuer general values it and unless you 're selling your property it 's of no no value to you at all as to the value of general 's valuation um all it seems to do and as i 've previously stressed it 's increasing uh those the better properties that are managed better tend to bear a higher burden than those who manage their properties who are often not actual business enterprises but are running it from sydney as a hobby farm and then they allow to go have weeds and things over so the actual when we do the rate scenario their rates fall and those who are running a businesses rates increase so the whole thing i don 't believe is appropriate and i know it 's being looked at and i will discuss with the director of corporate services when that review is going to be finalized under i think it 's the last item in business with the table of uh outstanding items but i believe that we are placing unreasonable expectations on our businesses the rates by 2.6 again it is just sowing some disdain for those businesses thank you thank you councillor i will just note councillors that there were only four submissions uh received uh when this was out on exhibition i have personally had nobody come in to see me to talk about this um i 'll just note that so council danny did you want to say something else before i put the recommendation put this uh yes ma 'am if i may yeah if council would indulge me um i i listen keenly to what councilman mckibben says and uh and and and i recognize um even though i 've worked in education i have worked in private business my entire career and you know when you haven 't got the money things changed and when you have got the money you know times are good but i just this whole argument about rates we may be considering looking to something like the canberra system where in fact the value of the asset you own will increase the amount of rates you pay council mckibben notes that the higher that is true but around the world over the last 20 years the real thing that has occurred is that those people who own an expensive asset have been able to leverage their lifestyle through debt and the people who do not own an expensive asset have have simply slid farther behind like looking at the table two in our rates which indicates that farmland is 68 of land value but only 47 percent of rates i think that 's the correct ratio i you know would be wrong um to burden farmers that greatly residential is only 10 of value therefore less borrowing less asset value but paid 23 percent of rates so they actually bear many pensioners in town a more disproportionate burden rural residential that 's about right 16 of land value 16 of the total rates paid and my argument has always been we should sting that group a bit more i think they should pay a bit more to help perhaps take the burden from the um the farming operations and business 2.3 percent of land value and only nine percent of rates i think is an equitable distribution of our rate burden here and there are there are benefits to many of our group who have a high asset value um and i i appreciate council mckibben 's points but i i don 't think they 're the full picture so i continue to support the original motion and will be voting against the amendment thank you um sharon could you please put up the amendment so i can read it out for determination please thank you so the amendment is that council adopt the 2020-21 operational plan and that rates be increased by 1.5 percent on general rates and town improvement levy and that the general manager provides savings of 96 477 and that council adopts the long-term financial plan in line with the savings proposed i 'm going to put that amendment councillors all in favor could you raise your hands prominently please one two three four against one two three four five the amendment 's lost we go back to the original motion that council adopts the 2020-21 operational plan and long-term financial plan as submitted i 'm going to put five six seven against against counselors one two two emotions carried thank you councillors we go now to number two that council adopt the 2020-21 statement of revenue policy as submitted could i have a mover for that recommendation please counselor kellum is there a second applies counselor kaipal council kellum was there a second amendment second i was counsellor cable thank you i missed all that froze for a moment are you speaking to the recommendation council uh yes ma 'am madam mayor i will the long-term financial plan uh revenue policy so the policy um should be um as as um in the recommendation we kept it as submitted thank you counselor kaipal oh yeah sorry sorry about that um yes very comprehensive um madame mayor um i i really can 't_''_3762.559 um add anything more than that um i 've gone through it and while my understanding of economics is not in the same garden as some others on this council i support the i support the adoption thank you comments counsellors please if there 's no comment i 'm going to put the recommendation that council in favor okay council online did you raise your hand through the chair was asking for something um councillor mckibben was asking for something sorry i can 't see your hand councilman kevin i can only see your head okay councilman kevin mr speak before we go that recommendation vote sorry yes madam mayor i did apologies i obviously wasn 't shaking my hand sufficiently in adopting the statement of revenue policy i 'm assuming that we are therefore adopting um the rate increase as proposed in the previous resolution that 's correct isn 't it because the revenue policy is based on the basis of those rates that 's correct um on that basis i would have to oppose madam mayor thank you councillor any other comments council danny just thank you madam just for point of clarification the rates would be affected by the 2.6 percent as in the ipad organization but the fees and charges i understand correct me if i 'm wrong or at 1.3 is that correct i just wanted to clarify that thank you that 's correct i 'm going to put the recommendation i can 't see your hand you 're not you haven 't got it one two three four five six against one councilman kevin 's gone i think he said he was against he did he did so who 's the third one that 's against so against his councillor lion and councillor mckibben and four was seven which is councillor sadroids gibbons pelham dhoni capel mckechnie and mccarthy is that correct thank you the motions carried items three four and five that council approved the o 'connell community group rollover of unused two thousand nineteen twenty five thousand dollar village improvement funds to 2020-21 operational plan the council approved the bargainer and district community association rollover of unused 2019-20 5000 village improvement funds to the 2020-21 operational plan and that council review the vision and mission statements at the next community strategic plan review can i have a mover for those three recommendations councillor gibbons thank you a second to councillor capel councillor gibbons to speak to the recommendations i 'd like to speak to the recommendation uh but i 'd like to add uh an additional recommendation after village improvement plan for black springs still has thirteen hundred and eighty dollars left and i wanted to move that along with the other three so you tell me how we do that i don 't quite understand uh maybe the general manager can explain to me i sort of understand but how do you want to put it into these are you saying that the balance of the village plan is thirteen thousand thirteen hundred thirteen hundred and you wanna roll that over 180 we want to roll it over along with the other the other two villagers can i confirm that that is the amount of money that is available for rollover place it is okay yeah that 's correct okay so councillor gibbons are you happy just to change that amount or do you want to remember that 's fine thank you just for that additional recommendation along with those so the recommendation sorry madame madam has to be a separate item because we 've we haven 't dealt with black springs there already so it has to be an item six that we approve the black 380 or whatever it was village improvement funds funds to 2020 21 operational plan i can we can do it like that instead of the total would be hundred and it not am i understanding this i 'm not hearing terribly well i 'm through sorry i think they 've used 4 000 roughly but they 've still got 1300 not used can i get some direction here from the general manager because i 'm not hearing very well councillors through the chair madame similar to recommendation three and recommendation four when the complete rollover of monies has been proposed not and eighty proposal that was right with lodged today from black springs is that council approve the black springs community group rollover of unused 1920 1380 village improvement funds to the 2021 operational plan so of the 5 000 they were allocated for this financial year they have 380 remaining and they propose to roll that into 2021 similar to that of o 'connell and blacks and burger okay so the five thousand dollars that written here in item number three is that rolling over as well yes so o 'connell valley group yeah marie is for o 'connell okay i 'm with him and six will be for blackboards okay you 've got it now thank you councillor gibbon are you happy to add that extra dot point because if councillor gibbons and councillor cable are happy to at the six stock point we don 't need an amendment is that correct i 'll take advice from the general manager on this one through the chair if if you if the mover and second are happy to add and the council is in agreeance in that sixth spot you have that sixth recommendation okay council givens and counselor capital are you happy to add a.6 definitely yes counselor capal i thought um i thought this was going to be simple but yeah i 'll that 's that 's okay by me i 'll accept that i 've probably made it more complicated because i 'm not hearing what people are saying everybody appears to be dropping in and out and i 'm getting half half the story and some councils are talking over others which is not good and you can clarify that 's correct we now have a recommendation in four parts the council approved the o 'connell valley community rollover of unused nineteen twenty five thousand dollar village improvement funds to the two thousand twenty twenty one operational plan that council approved the barakah and district community association rollover of unused two thousand nineteen twenty five thousand dollars village improvement funds to two thousand twenty twenty one operational plan the council review the vision and mission statements at the next community strategic plan review that council approve the black springs and dis the black springs community association rollover for unused 1920 funds of 1 380 village improvement funds to the 2020 21 operational plan have i got that correct okay council givens do you wish to speak to these recommendations i think it 's fairly straightforward thank you thanks councillor councillor cable no i think you met a mayor that you 've got it sorted thank you any any other comments on this one councillors i 'm councillor johnny just thank you madame um i just note number five and i did mean to talk about it 's not out of order i 'd like to thank people who put into submissions to this and appreciate their um keenness of intellect and intelligence and comment as long as those submissions of course are constructive and not personal then as a counsellor i really value them and i note some of those submissions to the vision and the mission statements um sometimes treat them with the disdain they should be treated because you know they 're sort of motherhood statements however if we are going to develop a land use strategy then i think people who have concerns about the vision and mission statement are not going to have to wait a long time before they 're going to really have the opportunity to argue exactly what those vision and mission statements work out to become in our land use strategy i think that 's uh the impact of those statements on our planning is going to be quite significant in the near future so i encourage people with strong opinions there to um to look forward to that time they won 't have to wait long one councillors i 'm putting the recommendation in three four five and six four parts all in favor carried thank you [Applause] page 51 councillors item 1302 returns disclosing returns disclosing interests the recommendation is that council note the requirement to lodge a return disclosing interests of councillors and designated persons can i have someone to move that place counselor kellum and council mccarthy thank you councillor callum uh it 's a uh administrative process we all need to go through and i understand that that 's that 's occurred already thank you mccarthy uh requirement government any other comments counsellors put the recommendation all in favor thank you age 57 councillors item 1303 related party disclosure policy review the recommendation is that council approve the related parties disclosure policy 2220 as presented is there a mover please council mckibben thank you and councillor dhoni councilman um thank you madam mayor as as the previous one um look at related party disclosures um my only question was i did ask um my interpretation of the accounting standard that 's called up in policy 2220 was slightly different to the director example of issues with councils in fact went far further than i think the notes to our related disclosure policy state and that it can bring in um cousins and others i 'm i 'm wondering if the director of corporate services has had a chance to uh look at that go to the director um madame i we did uh review this and um it was considered by the uh staff and the advice we received from the office of local government that uh for this policy for as it stands at the moment this is sufficient um and but they are looking at reviewing it for future um uh reviews uh moving down the track that 's a look at them there have been several councils where um in relation to related party disclosures the non-disclosure of a cousin 's interest has been a hell that should have been disclosed if you look on the website if you look at do a search of this policy that concerns me as to the extent that we do or do not disclose okay um through madame i 'm happy to research i did in the time that i had we were satisfied that it is sufficient at this point in time accounting standard that was the issue any other comments on this one councillors through the chair just uh just to comment on that um given the nature of this this is the the minimum standard if councils want to provide more information than that on their disclosure they 're quite entitled to us my understanding and happy to take advice from the corporate services director but this is at the minimum that we require and if councils want to put more in there um we more than happy for that to occur through the anatomy yes that is correct this is a minimum it 's not a maximum but you will come back the director will come back with with some further advice to councilman cuban and other councillors i will yes any other councilman cuban um problem maybe not for so much our disclosure as to whether our relatives like us disclosing their interests is more a problem i think this is correct um really raised by all 's well and truly noted council danny did you want to speak to this to the as the seconder council dhoni council tony hello you were the seconder of this motion did you wish to speak to her yes ah thank you i wasn 't apologies there 's a lot of freezing up of frames tonight that 's okay thank you i 'll just note on page 61 4 4. i don 't know if it 's relevant under point six second paragraph the method of identifying the close family members and associated entities to the key whatever they 're called key management personnel will be by key management personnel self-assessment i think that broadens it significantly from close family members to uh to cousins thank you councillor any other comments counsellors i 'm putting the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 62 counselors item 1304 policy review 2010 workplace health and safety the recommendation is that the revised policy 2010 workplace health and safety be adopted as presented a mover police councillors councilman cagney and councillor mccarthy thank you councilman cagney um yesterday mary looks pretty straightforward all the statutory requirements thank you councillor council mccarthy uh happy with why it 's been handled madame thank you any other comments councillors councilman dhoni thank you madam mayor um what and i look for it i may have just missed it what is a pcbu a sorry pc in the document 64. yep number eight um through through the mayor who i forgot to unmute that is correct from what the deputy means sorry i didn 't hear it the pcbu is the person conducting a business unit that is the ultimate authority responsibility in an organisation did you hear that counselor johnny i did thank you madam mayor and i note the difference between the old policy and the new policy the old policy uses terms like uh minimize risk management rehabilitation promotion of workplace health and safety and inspections that are just not in the new policy so i 'm assuming the new and they are obviously crucial things so i 'm assuming the new policy covers those same things but in different terms perhaps somebody who understands this more than they can comment on that just does it in the current terms that we 're looking at um the policy with the dot points on page 63 basically what those things are it 's the highlight of what the responsibilities of each person are it 's just new it 's the jargon thank you thank you councillor any other comments counsellors put the recommendation all in favor all right thank you page 68 councillors item 1305 review of use of internet and email policy 2015. the recommendation is that the um the revised use of internet and email policy 2015 be adopted as presented can i have somebody to move that way please counselor mckibben thank you a second our counselor kellum thank you council mckibben do you wish to speak to this recommendation [Music] thank you madame thank you madame um i did have i can see the changes but i did have a couple of questions about some of the changes um on in the new policy 2115 on page 69 in three under guidelines i 'm assuming that it 's now impractical not to transmit classified staffing contents commercial conference material etc been taken out yes i asked this question too i 'll go to the general manager please um yes madame that 's correct um and if i couldn 't marry the mayor the issue i think we talked about on page let me just find it um page 71 under use of internet websites um why um i didn 't understand why computer games had been removed in the third bullet point through the chair it 's download unauthorized software including games i think it was just a double up that they were trying to remove okay understood right thank you madam they 're writing they 're mindy queries thank you the other comments counselors counselor callum um madam mayor happy with most of the policy uh page 71 the second paragraph i think it is um the paragraph that reads an email sent by the account with a council document as an attachment must note details of the source of the document on the attachment and that 's fine the next sentence would seem to be redundant in that particular position and should be moved around i have already he will take action to to make that appropriately readable just by way of clarification madam mayor yeah i agree with the counsellor in this regard because it seems to um reflect the attachment rather than the email so we 're just going to remove that to make it very clear that like you might get an attachment and you have an email that provides all that stuff as the front of the attachment like the attachment is something that goes with the email we 're just trying to make it very clear in that instance that 's all so you 're removing the last sentence of that paragraph is that correct no through the chair we 'll just we 'll just add that the email including attachment busting add yeah okay all the counselors got that before they vote on it okay any other council givens yeah through the chair uh for one councillor anyhow if not more the internet and ipads are a new phenomenon and uh i think the guidelines set there has been well read by me in particular but uh so you know we need and understand things a bit better for myself thank you thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors put the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 75 councillors item 1306 tender t 2 20 20 4 gravel crushing services 2020 to 2023 there 's a recommendation in two parts that council nominate the open open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 106 bracket b of the local government regulation 2005 for gravel crushing services in accordance with tender t two zero two zero slash four and that council upon completion of the mandatory 21 day tender period a further informative report will be provided to council for award of tender determination can i have a mover please councillor gibbons and council mccarthy thank you councillor gibbons just through the chair i i believe this is the way to go it 's um it 's interesting to know that the 250 000 is the amount that we can use each year for gravel crashing and it 's needed i 'm just wondering through the engineer to explain to us all a little bit uh the 20 000 to give us a ballpark figure on i know a little bit about it on how much it it costs to crash per ton i know there 's set up fees with the crashing and there 's dismantling fees but the overall crushing there should be a way that we know roughly how much a ton it costs to have it crushed so give us a better idea of the money 's needed for these things madam mayor i 'd suspect if that cat figure is disclosed it would uh jeopardize the tender take some advice please uh through the chair yeah certainly it 's a variable uh price in terms of the raw material that 's one uh to be crushed and then what size it gets crossed down to then is the the determining factor of that per tonne unit rate differing pits the purpose of this particular tender gives the flexibility around being able to crush in a multitude of different pits across the local government area and as such we have council has run a particular gravel crushing tender uh historically in the past flexibility for any maintenance and capital works moving forward thank you council gibbons happy flat for the time yes thank you council mccarthy i know it 's just an operational procedure the other comments counsellors with the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 77 item 1307 local roads and community infrastructure program there 's a recommendation there councillors that council allocate the local roads and community infrastructure program funding to the following rows for upgrades and maintenance works as outlined in table 1 of this report mozart road gravely sheet 1500 meters western end edith road road safety improvement corner east of mcewens creek ginken road road safety improvement corner one kilometers south of edis road carl wood road rehab pavement drainage bitumen one kilometer on either side of west and east ends council mccarthy may um may ask that we split these into the four as four separate items do i have a secondary council givens all in favor anybody against thank you so the recommendation is that council allocate the local roads and community infrastructure program funding to the following roads for upgrades and maintenance works gravel resheet 1500 meters western end can i have a mover please i 'll move it dot point one clock is council mccarthy a second of a dot point one no second councilman kicked kekney you want to speak to dot point one council mccarthy yes madam um many many years ago we we borrowed four million dollars not many years ago chris has been here since then and and we re-shooted the mozart road i remember that we um i i had a few um discussion with uh the engineer mozart road for now the forestry is not telling us that it 's going to be a hall road or whatever it has two bad right angle intersections on the soil section and i 'd like to move that we don 't go ahead with this um mozart road that we go back to years ago when we promised the people out on the ginkin road that we would do one kilometer each year so my motion although i put this up that we support it to to get discussion is until we find out from the forestry where locked area we shouldn 't be doing any more on the mozart road because it 's been done in the last three to four years we had that four million dollars and we put gravel on this damn road so it bewilders me that the councillors didn 't have a bit of input into where this community funding program went to we 've just got this report i think the council has should have had discussion on it and and i i hope it gets voted down even though i moved also a kidney uh nothing further to add to um council mccarthy 's comments but other than you know i have several concerns about the mozart road and the forestry haulage which i 've raised before i i just think that re-shading with the gravel on it at the moment i drove over it yesterday um i don 't consider it um anywhere near as bad a rate as some of the others in the in the area as far as surface goes for light traffic but if it gets starts getting used for heavy haulage it won 't wait until the heavy haulage traffic um increases on the road are you speaking against that the first recommendation councillor yes i think we should we would be better off spending a hundred thousand dollars um on on a couple of other roads in the in the area council dhoni thank you madame um i appreciate both those comments by both councillors can i just have verification of the accuracy of the first one of councillor mccarthy 's comments that we expended that sort of money that recently on that road please general manager to the director uh thank you madam mayor uh just confirming there was 2.4 million dollars of lures funding the local infrastructure renewal scheme money as part of that kink and road did get some gravel re-shooting albeit not to a standard where it would be available to seal the the point of putting mozart in the particular report for consideration is council also has a priority roads matrix and upon that mosaic road does sit down the down the list this year we are doing doing ginken road which is actually part of that commitment report we make reference to putting some funding toward carwood road and cardwood road actually sits in the 2021-22 financial year but would be pulling it forward this year and behind that then is mozart road but the strategic move is to bring it to a position where if council think it 's suitable to gravel sheet the road in preparation of then uh in the in the following financial you 've been able to bring some money forward from uh another alternate source such as rose to recovery then to put a black top on the uh on that section of mozart road um from from abercrombie road to extended does that help sorry madame froze from the very beginning and i missed the first few sentences did the director note that we had spent a significant sum of money gravel reshooting it just a couple of years ago i missed the direct answer to that uh through the chair there was certainly some money spent on it but uh nowhere near uh 2.4 million dollars there would have been probably in the order of 20 or 30 000 madame um thank you madam i was confused as to the technical service director 's response so um if i could maybe set out how i understand i think what we 're saying so that mozart road had 20 to 30 000 spent on it in the last three years is that not correct three you met a man through the chair that 's correct yep that would be about right right um and we now do you as the technical services director believed that spending 100 000 on this road is warranted in in the current situation i know you 've talked about the road prioritization matrix but is that money worth while on the basis that it 's being used or could be used by forestry trucks in the in the future it that the surface may be affected by the use of those forestry trucks or are we better using the money elsewhere and when we get to the stage where forestry trucks are using this uh for that for those areas that it 's going to use for removing um obviously timber that we then look what you were saying in what was your recommendation in that regard uh through the chair certainly this report is only making reference to where the money can be spent it 's certainly the determination of council 's decision making local roads and all community infrastructure programs as it states merely on the concerns raised by residents bus companies and alike in terms of the state of the road is a suggestion of where this particular money could be spent in in comparison or in in in light of the priority rose matrix also that council has adopted so it 's it 's it 's really to council uh for consideration again um as a you know suggestion elsa gibbons they 're the chair the engineers right it 's also community infrastructure program uh and this is the only time we get to discuss these issues and their recommendations there we 've just submitted an application for acoustic board in the black springs hall on the 30th of the 6th i 'm just wondering that we have that shovel ready uh i 'm not sure what our chances are is infrastructure i 'd like to see uh it included in this one as well and not all on roads and i 'm a bit of agreeance with the previous speakers that we might be jumping the gun a little bit on mozart road it is a bus route and uh as i say all these dot points are up for discussion and this is the only opportunity we get to discuss that so uh i i 'd just like first to consider that some of this goes to the acoustic board at the black springs hall because at the present time we can 't have functions there or any music and we 're trying to work our way through some upgrades there and we 've we have got good grants but when we 'll know about our previous grant money whether it will be successful or not counselor can i suggest that we deal with mozart road as as a dot point that 's the recommendation that we 're discussing at the moment and if you want to bring a further recommendation or amendment in regard to the backsprings hall is that you happy with that otherwise we 're going to be all over the place can i just can i sorry counselor just just wanted to make that known that point i made so i 'm very happy to discuss it at the last point thank you can i just ask a question of the director i 'll come to you in a moment council mccarthy can i ask a question of the director the mozart road did you say was sitting third on our matrix uh i understand that sorry through the chair it 's certainly it 's sitting uh following following following carwood road you 'll note in this report cardwood road uh has been provided an allocation of funding for council consideration which then would consequently bring mozart in the priority rates matrix forward uh should council elect to do that so it 's really a debate for council to determine okay thank you um councillor can i even though i 've moved that recommendation can i move an amendment now i don 't think you can move an amendment when you 've moved a recommendation that it 's a hard one madam air given that the person and the second who moved it are speaking against it exactly and now i 'm moving an amendment oh it 's a i don 't think i 've come across a code of meeting practice before um i would take the point i 'd like to know what the councillors amendment would be they 've also indicated they 're going to split vote against the thing that they moved can you not foreshadow an amendment and councillors for years have been voting against once they 've moved it 's one of their favorite tricks that 's that 's not a problem but can he foreshadow the amendment to let the council know his mind that 's the one i 'd like to know can certainly do that um can i just go to councillor cable please counselor cable i often refer to you on amendments would you give your your view on this one please uh yes i can yes i certainly can um for a start madame it is um totally out of order for the mover 've we 've gone past that um uh as far as um moving an amendment if somebody else wants to move an amendment that 's okay but the the mover of the motion mover and second up shouldn 't move an amendment that was my understanding thank you okay counselor mccarthy did you hear that yes i heard that can i get a clarification then i understood that when we gravel-shaded that road it come from the money that we borrowed and was recommended to be borrowed from the government is that not correct through the chair that 's certainly correct it was part of the local uh local infrastructure renewal scheme program of 2.4 million dollars in total okay so we we didn 't ask you to go light on it we just asked you to make gravel road appropriately uh through the chair that 's certainly the uh was the objective which was achieved okay and the next section of the ginkin eater to ginkin road the next one kilometer when 's it programmed to be possibly looked at uh through the chair it 's certainly uh it year i uh you know certainly if it needs to to be brought forward then that 's the case but at this present time i 'm not not aware that it is actually to be done in the immediate near future okay so if this money was held over the hundred and fourth of a thousand dollars it wouldn 't affect your programs at the moment i know you got it written in for september but if it was uh the money was to be held over and discussed of other appropriate um projects that wouldn 't hinder your programs uh again through the chair certainly that 's a decision of council to determine i i can 't influence that i can certainly influence it we have to have this detailed now on giving a response to the government in accordance with the report by the 31st of july this year so we need to make an allocation of this money by the 31st of july so this is why it 's back in front of council you know my the reason why mozart road from my understanding talking to proactive and to be ready for improving your local roadmaps and according to the decision the council has made to improve the local roads um if the if the develop if the mozart road was brought up to spec that only meant that a small amount needed to be undertaken on that it meets the requirements of council 's resolution to bitumen sir one to two kilometers of road um each year now this year peter both incan road and carl wood road have seen an allocation put on that to bring them up to a standard which meets the requirements of the of the resolution of council mozart road is the next one so if you don 't do it now you do it like we 'd still come back under the provisions of our local roads matrix and look to do it the following year regardless of whether the timber industry are going to put anything on at all unless council want to go and have a re-look at their new matrix now if councillors don 't want to do mozart road as suggested by the director what like to do that that could be an additional allocation on to ginken road an additional allocation on the carwood road an additional allocation onto potentially a community project should they resolve it that way i just strongly encourage council to come up with that money right now as part of this report so as we can meet our obligations with the federal government in this with this money council mckibben thank you thank you madam mayor um the general manager his comments have somewhat gone to what i was going to address i 've looked at the road matrix or priority road matrix um a few minutes ago just to double check so we have carwood then we have mozart then we have seals creek road as far as i understand the alternatives i see it are that we progress with the mozart road gravel race sheet we extend the car wood road work that we 're intending to do or the ginkin road work we 're intending to do or we are determined to do some work on um the sills creek road which it actually is of matrix i believe that we did set this road prioritization matrix for a purpose and that as far as possible we should be trying to stick to it for our future direction because we did spend a lot of time on doing that prioritization at that time and i don 't think any of the circumstances to which has led to that prioritization has really changed as to uh councillor gibbons 's issue about the um black springs hall um while it 's been raised i think we have to be careful about what eligible community infrastructure projects might be able to be included and i it says um closed circuits ctv painting of community facilities i 'm not sure that it actually deals with sound attenuation activities so it may not even that might not even fall within the um eligible community infrastructure projects but i would seek obviously some point of clarification from the general manager on that but my strong point is that we either should extend carwood roads work hard road work um or do some more right on work on gingka or we stick to sheet on mozart road as long as that work in the future is not going to become nugatory or have to be redone if in future it 's bitumen as a result for forestry if it 's good value for money and that 's what i was trying to get out of the technical services director with his expertise and knowledge does he believe that that work is warranted and provides us good value for money moving ahead into the future noting that this will be used more by forestry and that there 's a possibility at some stage in the future it will be bitumen through the chair again it 's part of your rates uh priority matrix councilman mckibben it 's a decision for council uh irrespective of forestry corporation 's business it does sit on that matrix and it is a betterment to the improvement off-road assets so you know the funding certainly go a long way to improving that particular road again in that priority rose matrix from a strategic point of view can i ask what the safety aspects on that road are currently i not safe is this correct through the chair this current form yeah through the chair there 's certainly been some i suppose concern for the bus companies using the road you know transporting obviously children on a daily basis vegetation was probably the main safety concern i think which has just been recently addressed but other than that certainly bitumen will certainly facilitate probably an approved um service you know for road safety thank you into the future cable thank you madame um yeah you touched on something that that i was going to um remind us about that we seem to be focusing a fair bit on forestry and log trucks but there are residents who live along that road as well it is a bus route um i i haven 't been along it for a while but it 's never a great road to drive on um anything that we can do to make it safer and and better to drive on i think we should be doing it particularly as as we have decided on the matrix and um and the position uh that the mozart i 'm going to put this recommendation unless council mccarthy would like a right of reply well my reasoning for being so staunch that we shouldn 't be spending this money on this road is what we need a long-term plan and we need the forestry and our local member on board the same as what we did at the hazel grove road it 's a bus route as well the reason on the mozart road you 'll have two riding or bends if we don 't eliminate those and start working on that road with our local member to get funding to do the whole thing as a whole road which is going to be because how they 're going to bring that timber out on that land landlocked bit of ground i know what we 're doing we 've got to stay safe and the residents down there with the bass roof but we just tied the sills creek road on our metrics and the bus don 't go down there so our metrics is wrong but anyway that 's not to be verbated tonight all i 'm get an answer out of the forestry how they 're going to get it out of there the local residence tells us that there 's a crown road that comes off the forestry ground onto the mozart road that will be the logical way they 're going to haul it why jason muller camp can 't tell us where the timbers got going to come out it 's got me beat but we need to do a whole design on this road it 's got bad curves on the eastern end as well and if this starts to be a logging road and you 've got log trucks going down there and the bus coming up there 's another danger it 's not just a matter of soon on the road and the danger of the school buses goes away anyway that 's the way i feel about it thank you thank you okay counselors counselor line um sorry has it been any thought for street beautification and tree planting landscaping with any of this money uh council can we discuss that after we 've done the dot points deal moment and then it will depend if any of the recommendations get defeated as to whether there 's any money left over to do other projects okay it would be logical to discuss that and the black springs um issue at the end of the um the recommendation if that 's okay with you thank you okay councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation the dot point one mozart road gravel resheet 1500 meters western end all in favor please one two three four five six against one two who 's the other against councillor gibbons are you against three motions carried we 'll now go on to dot point two edith road edith road road safety improvement corner east of mcewens creek can i have a mover please council mccarthy and a second to please council mckibben thank you council mccarthy now i i understand the um councillor gibbons brought to the last council meeting and it didn 't get up and this is an avenue of uh fulfilling that requirement of improving the road safety at that corner it has an accident in history so it should you madam mayor i fully support council mccarthy 's comments so it has wrote history and um we were it was explained to us by councillor gibbs why it was needed improvement and i totally agree thank you any other comments councillors councillor gibbons mr chair we have a duty of care to our road users big accident history it 's a road to the caves it can the location of the curb can catch you off guard and it 's easy to um be thrown off the road by the poor design of that curb so i 'm supporting that thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors.3 02 you just wrote any other comments i 'll put the recommendation that edith road road safety improvement corner east of mccoohan 's creek all in favor carriage unanimously thank you dot point three ginkin road road safety improvement corner one kilometer south of edith road do i have a mover please counsel gibbons and a second to place nelson mccarthy thank you councillor gibbons yeah again it 's a bend with the same problem falls away strongly it and as we know there 's been accidents there and it 's it 's fairly dangerous so same deal thank you council council mccarthy now i 'm happy with the comments thank you thank you any other comments counsellors on this one if not i 'm going to put the recommendation that council allocate the local roads and community infrastructure program funding to the following roads ginkan road road safety improvement corner one kilometres south of edith road all in favor carried unanimously thank you number four carl wood road the recommendation is that council allocate the local roads and community infrastructure program funding to coal wood road rehab pavement drainage bitumen one kilometer on both west and east ends can i have a mover please councillor dhoni and a second to please councillor kellum council dhoni thank you madam mayor no i think i commented last time um that it 's good to see that this will now reach the intersection with saunders road or saunders lane there 's a bit of traffic out of there and that the carwood road is becoming quite a commuters road and will callum i support uh council danny 's comments there and i think it 's um and this is the highest priority road on our matrix for the ones that we 're considering thank you any other comments on this one councillors councillor gibbons through the chair it says one kilometer on the east side and the west side to me that causes a few problems when you 're doing a section of road and if you 're doing two kilometers together you 'll do it a lot cheaper than doing one kilometer on the western end and one in the eastern end i would have liked to have thought it might have been better to carry this out on the western end up the bad hills past saunders road where i consider the other side a little bit easier but anyhow that 's just a comment thank you councillor gibbons is there any other comments council mccarthy um sirium can the director advise us where we 're getting the gravel from i understand that um the easton ends the clay base and now needs gravel underneath it to form the those big ghoulies in it so they 'll have to be removed and the road gravel um where where are we securing the gravel from uh through the chair that 's certainly to be determined at this stage on the on the quality of the gravel required um more than likely it 'll be more of a localized source more closer to the actual particular road in itself from a local quarry so are we taking advantage of a a um proposal was put to you that um an operator supply crush gravel on site that was put to you your understand uh through the chair look it 'll be have to be determined at this stage i don 't actually have a definite on that um the other one concern is how do you price the job if you don 't know where the material is coming from if it 's got a long haulage thing how do you price the job then uh through the chair i 've based it on a i said a local quarry which is an increased proximity um again it hasn 't been for full pricing okay thank you thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors the recommendation that council allocate the local rising community infrastructure program funding to colwood road rehab pavement drainage bitumen one kilometer on both west and east ends all in favor carrie thank you so as those four recommendations were passed that does take up that funding i take note of councillor gibbons suggestion for the black springs hall i do understand that there is already a grand application in with crown lands for that project counsellor and that 's not yet been determined that 's correct okay if that isn 't successful though i guess or is that money comes to the council for a decision or can it go to another shire or what is the deal with that what i 'm sorry i don 't understand what you mean it 's what i 'm saying that we put this in proposal for the bats for the war but are there other applications gone in from the over on council for this same grant or not all i don 't think oberon council about any other organizations can find that out i 'd love to be successful but i don 't know what the chances are [Music] if it 's unsuccessful there are other options i 'm sure um for a shovel ready project like that one can we discuss that offline okay thank you and councillor lyon i 'm sorry i missed what you thought you would like to sorry la casa line i can 't hear you uh it was um street beautification and landscaping tree planting we do have money in town improvement fund allocated to that councillor thank you okay thank you [Applause] okay councillors page 79 item 1401 monthly activity report general manager the recommendation there is the report is received as information can i have somebody to move that place council mckibben thank you and a second to place council mccachney thank you councilman mckibben thank you madam mayor uh look extensive report and i noticed uh as i think was foreshadowed by the general manager at the last meeting that the actions relating to motions of the council or resolutions of the council have been moved 's an improvement and easy to read with a consolidation there um with all these tourist activities obviously and i 'm referring basically to page 82 um in light of the current covert 19 situation in sydney involving a number of hot spots um what are we intending to do in relation to the marketing activities outlined under marketing on page 82. welcome back tourism campaign nine it 's etc um do we need to suspend those currently to see what the uh continued uh situation is relating to the crossroads hotel um to the batemans uh batemans bay soldiers uh return services league uh rsl club um and i understand some outbreaks uh in the eastern suburbs of sydney um are you sure are you suggesting we put a halt to all of our marketing well i 'm suggesting we need to be mindful of the fact that there could be another lockdown um on the basis of what 's come out today and yesterday um no noting that numbers attending events and obviously restrictions on pubs have been tightened and there 's new restrictions coming in i think think we need to have this in the back of our mind that we may have to um maybe we should just suspend these at the moment pending what 's going to happen well i think we are right i would appreciate other councillors views on this but uh here that um you know we don 't know where we 're going at the moment it may be contained but it 's certainly been accelerating the last few days um we are of course abiding by all the office of local government and health guidelines as they come down in regards to events and it is a rapidly changing space most of this campaign is already actioned um right so we can get a report from matt from for you if you 'd like to um certainly can 't speak to it but i just think we need to i think we are conscious all the time because we are governed by lots of rules and conditions and should an event come up where conditions stop it going ahead obviously it won 't go ahead but if you 're not 've lost that market so which is very important to our business community so i suppose it 's a catch-22 situation but happy to get matt to or the general manager to get matt to give a little bit of an update on where he 's sitting with that strategy if that 's what you 'd like councilman mckibben that wouldn 't be a problem well well really i 'm just i 'm i 'm just suggesting that we need to be a little careful and monitor the situation and i 'm sure that 's what we i 'm sure we are yeah do we um but we don 't want to suddenly spend a lot more money on a new program now if it looks as though it 's potentially a lockdown could come out of it we 're just wasting our money i understand no i 'm not suggesting we need any more reports or anything i 'm just suggesting um normal common sense needs to prevail and i i don 't think we should be sort of budging to spend any more money at the moment in 're going i 'm sure that the the um tourism and economic development manager is very aware of that councillor dona sorry councilman kevin have you finished i finished but uh yes the report uh i recommend the report thank you councilman mckechnie uh yes madam man just only a couple of comments on the wh hs section of the report um interesting to note that we 've had a couple of incidents um reported i know the gain no hazards again for this month we we we must be one of the only businesses that don 't have too many hazards in it we never seem to come up with any um but that 's a good thing if it 's correct and and being done diligently but other than that no other comments thank you councillor councillor dhoni thank you madame um councillor mckibben 's point was one i thought of a bit difficult to raise as i understand it quite a number of jurisdictions now have excluded um two main areas and that is the state of victoria and the greater metropolitan sydney area thank you is off at the borders so they that shouldn 't be an issue but um greater metropolitan sydney i don 't think you can go to queensland northern territory that 's right and you know the greater metropolitan area you know it 's the whole trade so that 's a risk for us but just a couple of other elements um councillor mckinney was talking about the safety statistics and i just just wanted to inquire the first aid injury and the medical treatment injury um are those workers okay how severe or light was that situation those situations um through the cheerleading man through the gminer and okay okay thank you um and also page 81 the central new south wales jo hr under paragraph e i know it comes up later in our business papers but we had a problem with the local business sourcing convenient training um uh for cruise for for key workers required by legislation um because of the withdrawal of a local training organisation does this offer any solution to that problem or should we save that for confidential labor through the chair there where partner with others to get things done in a regional sense and therefore cheaper for us so if we can be if we can be provided with training opportunities that we don 't have to go to sydney forum we can do it as a as a group we 're trying to partner in as much of those as we possibly can but that 's why my i i think i 'll raise it in later discussion matt and me thank you that 's all on my side thank you councillor paul madame thank you just on the subject of promotion and marketing that um councilman gibbon raised her a while ago i agree with what he said about that we need to be watching the um the expenditure on these issues uh just at the moment um i i don 't know how much we 've spent or anything but at the same time i think it 's important that we keep our area in um we keep promoting it just um so that when things do change people will come back to the to the area uh it in the accommodation industry with the possible exception of the motels has been flat out um in and basically uh quite unprecedented levels of people coming in into the area um i think uh it 's been a terrific campaign and we need to keep it trickling along the the the visitation from uh people and from whence they come is not an issue for council that 's a that 's a state government they 'll decide uh who gets locked down and who doesn 't and i don 't think we could play any role in that at all not in the actual closing of the area no we definitely couldn 't that does come from the state government but i take the point about being very careful about what we 're investing in um at the moment so any other comments counseling the general manager just by way of clarification the the information that 's been provided in that in that space has come from the grant that council received being that hundred thousand dollars um that council has approved back in i think it was june maybe our bushfire funding and it 's under the control of resilience new south wales now and just to give some uh maybe some uh to relieve a little bit of concern we 're meeting with them next week in fact to discuss all these things especially in relation to how we can move forward in a potential covert situation um and what that would mean for for activities that we 're proposing moving forward so hopefully that gives a bit of an overview on on the on the commentary that 's been raised by councils any other comment counselors council mccarthy general managed to give us an update on 8th of july spiro cavallaros what services he offering the council don 't already have i 'm through the chair um spiro come to see us regarding the qualifications he has and if council has any any need for that type of service then he was availing his services he also was um uh talking to myself and the mayor in regard to potential opportunity for council to further source or further um contact local businesses when we 're looking to um what he believed the council could do to in fact re-engage with the with our local contractors that we took on board now my question was what services is he offering that we don 't already have uh through the chair he offers some environmental services that we uh often partner with others to supply like our testing for our landfill processes they are things that he could offer however the question remains that in that situation we have to we have to go through the right process thank you any other questions counselors put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 85 item 1402 monthly activity report planning and development the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have a mover please council mccarthy and the second of police councillors councillor mckibben thank you council mccarthy um yes madame the report 's pretty straightforward my two questions i have um very little activity at the independent living units today is that the norm um hasn 't it gone over the um six months billing period i know we don 't want to rush 't seem very much activity there a vehicle getting repaired i don 't know whether that fits in with the own requirements is it through the general manager planning i can 't comment on today per se council mccarthy for the chair but uh still tracking towards the buildings being finished by the end of next month so okay thank you and the other one was the dog the why marana dog that 's out on the brass walls road that 's given us grief and this cost us a fortune have we ever tried to trap it individually off-site offered some uh the side of the owner have we ever said it tried to set a trap up so we can actually catch the dog say on the neighbouring property or on the um road verge um through the chair i 'm i 'm not sure about that but i 'm led to believe there 's a quite a number of dogs and i i suggest a practicality you 're doing that would be quite difficult um we are looking at our opportunity to regard that situation you know this has been going on for years probably cost us over twenty thousand dollars in actual costings but if we can 't one of the things was that we can 't_''_8389.04 identify the particular dog was a problem i just can 't understand why we can 't hire or build some traps fasten them out there on the road verge and trap the dog that 's seems to be giving everyone a grief i 'm sorry but i think we might have to spend some money to alleviate the neighbours out there free to cheer once again i i acknowledge that but i 'm led to believe that the incidents are fairly um irregular and um currently i 've led the blue there um back in the yard i think the bigger issue that i see is to uh uh have a long-term solution regarding the management of the uh animals in question and that 's what we 're looking at okay thank you council mckibben um thank you madame um i 'm just wondering uh if um if we 'd be the report 's very good but if we for the fitness center and the independent living units as to how we 're going against schedule and cost um each time we have this report so this is a schedule completion date how we 're tracking against our microsoft project whatever is scheduled to achieve that and where our costs are tracking us against the total cost to complete is that possible um brutal chair are we planning on development more information regarding how his tracking regarding the cost is and schedule so that we we can say that you know yes it 's meeting skip we were due to get this to this stage at this stage which that 's the practical completion date we 're still tracking to achieve that by that date something like that um the other question i had is in the first section under compliance certification which is seven planned activity for june july page 85 um it 's a little oblique and maybe it 's necessary to be a leak about the investigation to unauthorized residential accommodation um it 's not where not even reading between the lines we really actually ascertain 's a confidential nature um through the chair it it is deliberately uh somewhat oblique in nature the reason i included it is because we 've had um a couple of situations with people living in sheds and we 're trying to balance getting them getting approval versus ensuring the safety of the occupants it 's a it is a balancing act but that 's why i included but i can 't talk about the details now okay um and the third thing madam mayor if i could just comment on the dog issue that uh council mccarthy um i know that both lls and national parks fuels barossa national parks in oberon have extensive experience in getting rid of wild dogs and i 'm sure it could extend to to dogs that are also domestic that are tracking under people 's land cameras are always a good idea to actually be able to identify them if you could with infrared cameras they have access to those um the other thing is that there is an automatic right of obviously as we know of an owner if if dogs stray those dogs or to eliminate them um i could reconfirm that with the lls recently um so it might be worth talking to lls or jules cross at national parks in um in oberon um and i think i 've got the lis contact somewhere if uh if the director of planning development requires those but i um i second the report anime thank you any other comments counselor journey thank you madam mayor yeah i just noticed the compliance and certification issues too because there are a few sheds and containers being used over recent years as residences in the council area um that don 't lend themselves to an attractive uh um residential scape i 'm just wondering on page 86 down the bottom total fees for applications eight thousand nine nine five the year-to-date income is 136 thousand 138 of the total income roughly um what are we doing automatically with that excess over the budgeted figure you mean physically what happens to that money yeah where 's the money through the finance director i 'm feeling so any um application fees in relation to the if those areas and dealt with in that area um other fees of charges are dealt with within the general fund as in the fees and charges allocation so where is the reckoning that if we are already um oh so we are you know the financial years just finished yes if we are well over budget if we 've got thirty six thousand dollars extra then the ninety nine thousand dollars we estimated yep where does that 36 000 go does it just go into the section 94s that you spoke of or just consolidated revenue if it 's for a development application yes it would go into the um section 94 area and in accordance with the um and then all of that is calculated in the reconciliation at the end of this financial year so the amount that we forecast in any budget is an estimate yes of course and you know it 's it could go up or down each year it 's just fortuna it 's fortunate that we 're above this year but yes it is i was just going to note that um 36 of 47 000. there are some funds that uh need to be allocated appropriately counselor and it 's just not a general fund allocation as long as we don 't just lose it that 's important it 's definitely not lost um can i just confirm that this is 1920 that we 're talking about not 2021 yeah is that it council johnny i could i could not hear anything that the general manager said madame good the general manager clarified that that over um or that excess funding was 1920 not 2021 i agree you know that 's why we 've got the money now that 's right thank you thank you any other comments on this one counselors council mccarthy by um the independent living units we were told a six months contract with no rise and fall was that correct we might have to ask the general manager um through the chair the six-month contract was something that i i certainly asked the um plea and development director to have a look at he 's um of the opinion that the end of august would i dearly can 't i can 't confirm that it was six months but if the planning director has any further clarification i 'm sure he can provide it to you what about the rise and fall no no rise and fall in in the contract for the six months time to build it i thought that was one of the conditions that shane said when the contract was leased uh signed we need to know this we should shouldn 't be paying out extra money i think there 's a variation in the landscaping but the extra construction on the um building site was six months and no rise and fall and the planning director come back to council mccarthy with that clarification um in regard to the uh fruit of madame it 's going according to budget in regard to the main build um i i can 't comment on the six months at this point in time i need to take that on notice thank you what about any overrun was what was the comment there um through the mayor i 'm i 'm not already over i 'm included but that 's currently looked at now well i 'm i 'm sorry but we 're near the tail end of it and i know you 've only just started with us but we we need someone to take the responsibility to to make sure that everything 's up to scratch don 't we this is a lot of money and um and the time i understood that he didn 't start in the previous year which he the contract was already signed but i understand that there was a six-month contract with no rise and fall welcome the director can come back to you with that council mccarthy you 'd have to take that on notice i 'm happy to do that thank you thank you any other comments on this one councillors councillor mckibben councilman kevin the internet keeps cutting it now um i like council mccarthy thought it was a six-month fixed term contract is what i thought it was explained to us as that will come back then the director said he would take that on notice thank you the other comments counselors i 'm you page 90 counselors item 1403 monthly activity report technical services there 's a recommendation there that report is received as information counselor downey thank you a second to please councilman councillor dhoni thank you madam mayor just two quick three quick things um this road signage damage and theft out of oxton and campbell 's river roads i think someone 's building a shed no they 're having a good time on saturday night they 're not building a ship two other ones um the um asbestos water mains i 'm aware that there 's some a new technology around that 's um inserting sleeves into [Music] major and minor piping systems which reduces the the cost of you know digging them up and fixing them and stuff like that are we digging these things up or are we putting in sleeves in them it 's my belief that we 're laying pipes alongside i 'll go to the technical services director just for clarification on that we have a program uh yeah through the chair we have uh been replacing the uh old fibro asbestos cement pipes with standard here quite well aware there is a pipe bursting technology out there that can particularly re-sleeve pipes it 's more probably preferred in terms of a repair mechanism uh you know certainly when you 've got a case where it 's a hard to get scenario for a repair but ideally where ground conditions permitted is probably more ideal to replace the particular asset in totality okay and uh just lastly um it was a very successful um pr exercise to mow the uh o 'connell recreation ground shortly after it came into our possession uh people were uh were very pleased and glowing about it and so uh well done that we uh got someone down there and tied it all up and uh people in increased their sense of ownership so that was great thank you very much thank you um uh thank you madam mayor and it 's pleasing to see the works continuing with the over on street footpaths and it 's evident baldridge road technical services director what are we going to do about that seemed to be repaired and then seems to revert i don 't know what is the fix for it because um as soon as work 's done it seems to go back if we have another storm this weekend it 'll probably again go into a shocking state through the chair certainly there 's been issues with the ongoing haulage that was out there at the time when we were trying to repair what was already sustained damage to the road uh again the quality of particular road based material locally obviously to try to keep costs down has always been a bit of an issue in the particular area of the local government um area of barika we are currently uh looking certainly at other alternatives um uh around the borough area and probably in the near future hope to bring some sort of report before council to talk to that so uh those discussions and that quality of material uh source are being ascertained uh in in the immediate near future but uh it 's it 's an issue certainly if you 've got heavy vehicles still running on a on a road that 's been freshly to uh you know certainly dry out and and the winter temperatures don 't uh really help you know we can only hope that uh certainly with what we 've just done here in the last week we 'll hold together thank you madame um second to support thank you very much how 's the lion through you ma 'am mayor just want to say um the parks and gardens are greatly improved um it 's it 's it 's showing it 's very obvious um the mulching 's looking good the mowing has been attended to slashing along the sides of the road especially the entrance in from abercrombie looks so much better also the pavers the improvement in the pavers in the main street the taking out of all the broken ones really looks good the footpath going across the pedestrian crossing is much better thank you just want to say thank you and it 's very obvious it looks good thank you council line any other comments councillors council mccarthy thank you for doing the footpaths looking great um just a query where did the material that we had one of forestry corporation as support to local transport um so again you know the inferior types of material that are particularly around that area uh are the difficulty in terms of being able to you know get stability in that road so we 're having to for any decent material having to haul it 's uh you know certainly some distance and that 's back as far as at least the uh the five ways or the uh isabella road pit there um you didn 't identify where it come from some of it did originally come from i did say the forestry corporation in terms of their nearby gravel pit so a lot of that was from that particular pit so that has been the issue in terms of the gravel quality and why the why the road sort of uh hasn 't performed as good as it should okay thank you any other questions councillors put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you [Applause] age 96 councillors item 1404 monthly actively report corporate services the recommendation is there that the report is received as that second to place counselor johnny thank you i think that 's a very good report um lots of good things happening now at the library we just hope we don 't have to shut back down again that would be pretty bad apart from that i just commend the report thank you to the director council dhoni thank you madam mayor i agree it 's some good activities in a different difficult circumstance like you know since uh so many of them are person to person so well done thank you thank you any other comments counsellors counsel mccarthy no it 's not of the director are the police aware of the time frame that they need to um contact the council to get the ctv footage on the bottom of 97. yes through the mayor yes they are so what 's what 's the time frame before it 's overridden overridden um it depends on where the cameras are the main cameras are uh three months and the and some of them are one month so that they are they are familiar with what when they 're required that 's enough time isn 't it thank you thank you councillor any other comments here put the recommendation all in favor all right thank you page 102 counselors 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is that council received the report items information for information can i have a mover please council donate in a second to please counselor kellum thank you counselor danny i hope uh thank you madame um i hope that we uh continue our um vigilance of uh successful financial management i thank the director for their um article on um uh what could happen when the whole banking system collapses but i it didn 't worry me too much i thought if it all goes down then we 'll find a way through but um no i 'm i 'm happy with the management of our investments madame though of course the reduction in interest income is uh another thing that 's difficult for us but um i think we 're doing a good job thank you councillor casa kellum uh happy with the report and the graph showing the interest rate drop over the this one councillors council mccarthy matter i know we 're getting a low interest rate but my comment is if we got big projects on the back burner and we have a plan simple things like circuit breakers i use in a household have risen 20 in three months that 's unbelievable amount of cost that went up 20 in three months this is what 's going to stifle our interest rate against our infrastructure but it 's just a comment that things outside there are actually rising considerably we have no control over even though the interest is low thank you thank you council mccarthy any other comments counsellors with the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 105 item 1406 grant 's monthly update recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have someone to move that please councilman kevin thank you a second to councillor gibbons thank you councilman kevin thank you madam mayor uh obviously um it 's um it 's great to see that we 've been successful with uh a large number of grants the economic creation ground um obviously talked about tonight um billy veteration 's outdoor festival 2021 let 's hope it can go ahead um and also the 5 million for the campbell 's river road i suppose one question i had is if um if we are not successful with getting our aqueduct funding for the campbell 's river road are we able to put any of this money towards that on the basis that it is part of the same road through the chair i think it 'd be difficult to do that given the the size and nature of the project being proposed should we not be successful and i can take a point from the director in this regard i would suspect that what we would be looking to doing is improving the existing formation rather than undertaking a deviation uh right yeah through the chair uh that that that is correct um certainly the funding can not uh be altered uh this uh fixing local roads program to do any of that deviation or uh via duct work as you refer councillor mckibben uh again the fixing country roads application is yet 's gonna be in the immediate short term thank you thank you thanks madam i i recommend the uh the report thank you councilman kevin councillor gibbons yes just through the chair uh i 'm reading here where the project has to be completed in the 12 months grants seem to be like this where you really don 't get the opportunity to knuckle down and suss it all out is there any opportunity that if this is too much that can be done over two years comment yeah through the chapter anticipating that it 'd be done in the 12-month period as as required by the grant so no extension is what you 're saying just a major it 's a major road works and we don 't want to be taking shortcuts and we 've got to do this one right so it 's a great grant so let 's see how we go we 've got a lot of other road works as well to complete this financial year so we hope we have a fairly dry summer thank you thank you counseling any other comments counsellors counselors all in favor harry thank you page 109 item 1407 water usage drought assistance the recommendation is there that the report is received and noted could i have a mover please thousand mccarthy in a second to please council callum thank you council mccarthy pretty straightforward thank you councillor callum nothing further away any other comments counsellors with the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you page 110 item water and sewer plant report the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have somebody to move that place council mckibben and council mckechnie thank you councilman kevin um we can 't hear you councilman kevin yes we can now sorry madam mayor i i know that the report be accepted madame it speaks for itself thank you so much councilman mccackney yeah chris madame air it 's um pretty straightforward and some routine maintenance and some um some repairs um so um yep i i recommend the report very uh accepted thank you councillor councillor dhoni thank you madam mayor um page 111 but purely you know for an aside liver what is a citric of manganese the water treatment plant on 111. can anybody tell me what a citric soap is yeah through the chi you through the chair that 's a uh a maintenance process with the actual uh the filtration membranes at the water treatment plant it 's uh a citric acid that 's actually applied uh in a soaking type process in the raw water tank so it um with the raw with the dam levels getting as low as they are that the metal levels are obviously increasing manganese and does require has been requiring more frequent um servicing to remove the manganese well yet to remove manganese and a few other elements yes thank you very much thank you madame thank you any other queries on this one councilman that 's okay thank you thank you thank you madam mayor um just something that um i guess we 're all going to have to come to terms with and give a fair bit of thought to is the fact that um we are now at the end of july weather is soon going to start warming up and we the last two or three months but things are going to change um are we developing a strategy for what we do when the summer comes um are we hoping hard enough we are hoping hard but we also are putting in trying to put in a strategy with water in new south wales and the general manager is constantly talking to them um i let him speak to that yeah so um water new south wales are abundantly aware of the concerns that we 've been raising about the constant and ongoing falling of our water supply it 's one of the only dams in new south wales are continuing to fall systematically so it 's something that we have been pushing for them to address a number of options and as part of their ipart review they are looking at undertaking some work but they won 't tell me what that work is at this point in time because i part haven 't given the money to do it so um it 's certainly something that we 're continuing to push we 're aware of it the impacts outlined and we need to be vigilant in pushing that uh we continue to look at options outside that the laws or likelihood of additional um requirements to source water but we 're in one of those situations where we already pay for our water at a pretty good rate for someone else to supply it so we continue to push warden new south wales as hard as we possibly can and we are also talking to ministers um constantly so hopefully there will be there will be something done in the very near future because as you say it 'll be just a very short time and we 'll be in spring and summer if we don 't get any inflow so it is it is a concern any other comments on this on councillors house online uh just to comment on the um period from the 22nd to the 30th the water consumption was up and also on the next page the sewage was up so is this telling us when the visitors arrive they use more water than we 've got is that just an assumption i director for that one visitors started coming at about that time uh thanks madame yeah certainly it 's a a great question um and yes could be attributed to uh in inflows of uh you know additional persons uh within the actual lga but um again look there 's no rhyme nor reason um certainly that i 'm aware or acutely aware of in terms of uh why that 's uh that that be the case but um uh yeah certainly there has been yeah notably another four mega leaders in comparison to the other three weeks thank you thank you council online councillor callum it might suggest madam mayor that the change may also be that it 's an eight day period at the end of the month rather than a seven day period thank you anything any other council givens oh yeah through the chair exactly how it reads there that you got six days 12 you 've got eight days 16 so there 's two more days in the bottom one so there 's just going to point that out that 's why there 's an increase put the recommendation all in favor harry thank you one page 113 item monthly update status of council resolutions the recommendation is that council received the reporter 's information can i have a mover please council mckinnon in a second to please councillor callum thank you council mckibben thank you madam mayor i 'm just waiting to be unmuted um [Music] it 's um interesting to see that the dog rocks uh issue seems to have moved along and that as late as the 8th of july we 've actually signed all the paperwork it 's just up to uh native title search now so um i think uh good to see general manager and director of technical services that this is finally appears to be coming to some resolution um on the item on page 115 uh item uh 1320 01 18 the um um east over on sewage project um so we 're not and now anticipating that the final documents will be prepared to september is it is is that correct so i thought we were hoping it was going to be july and and the paragraph do we now have actual agreement on design loading assessment um with uh the department or not i just couldn 't get that from the second paragraph whether we had it or not had it always seeking still seeking to get it uh through the chair um certainly we have uh concurrence for four and a half um ep that 's uh certainly what 's been agreed to and second to the bottom paragraph with hunter h2o they are working on the documentation adjustments and alike which certainly makes reference to bringing that back before the concurrence authorities september at this stage why september that 's two months away is it going to take that long through the chair again that 's what i 've been guided by from hana h2o in terms of being able to uh prepare that and and have that ready but certainly if that becomes uh something that we can bring forward that 's certainly our ambition okay well i i think it 'd be good if we could yeah this project 's been pushing out and pushing out and while we 've got some everything i think we should be pushing ahead as quickly as we can otherwise funding may not be available in the future um page 117 32 2105.19 um the last comment is a weighty confirmation of meeting date to finalize da who 's meeting with us is it a meeting with the director of planning and development to finalize the da and who 's having that meeting or is it a meeting with bourne and ourselves to finalise the da i 'm not quite sure what it means well through the chair it 's a meeting with ball as part of the relationship ball will be preparing the statement um so we can lodge a dea i apologize for the ambiguity but ultimately it 's the meeting where has been delayed somewhat with them to get access to their documents so is that we can lodge a da so update on when we because it 's been the da 's going to have been lodged quite some time when do we anticipate it being lodged asap so that means that by the end of july or earlier you try and look at what what 's being proposed the the first draft wasn 't something that we were happy with so we sent it back and they 're looking at that now okay so right um so the me the next item on 120 the roadside vegetation management plan uh that report will be tabled at august meeting after the discussions you 've had with the general manager of macquarie et cetera that is correct um the next issues i want to ask about um um it was the resolutions on page 123 1783 20 and 1703 20 0.504 they 're under investigation um this is question to the director of corporate services when are we likely to have the results of that investigation is it referring to 0405.0220 that 's right the ones at the top of page 123.04 yes 1703.20 and 05 1703 20. yeah um yeah sorry the sub categories and the library house yes the subcategories for the rating uh was i advised last meeting that that we are aiming for the october meeting for that um investigation and i also uh the library hours uh we but we will continue to investigate that we should also note that okay so we should also note that the office of local government are actually looking at the ipad recommendations from the rate review as the sub categories as we speak and we haven 't_''_10764.88 got that result down yet as to what the government might be doing about that that could actually influence um what the director is going to be bringing to us okay so could i just ask that when these are done that under investigation expect a report by october or something or whenever the date is going to be that it 's noted um i think that was the uh the last comments i had um other than on 129 i understood that um 31 1606 20 which is two thirds of the way down the page yeah relating to the overall pool and fitness center i think that 's for the management of the of it um um i didn 't didn 't believe those documents were being prepared until the center was being finished from the comment the general manager made the prepared are they through the chair we 're looking to prepare we 're undertaking the preparation of them as we progress all right well there are a couple of issues i raised which i 'll i can raise offline as to whether we 're sitting actually proposing a contract or with it yeah that 's all i have and i commend the report thank you councillor council calum we need to unmute councillor callum please thank you madam mayor the this format is much easier to deal with and uh much more logical and it 's pleasing to see it finally come to pass um i have no further comments on the uh the content of the the report thank you councillor any other comments counsellors counselor dining thank you madam mayor um 116. 21st of may just a bit of clarification um and off leash dog area the amphitheater at oberon dam buckley crescent and oberon tip there 's also mention of

thank you councilman page five councillors item four there are no apologies this evening page six counselors are any declarations of interest thank you page seven item six presentations tonight we welcome jenny bennett the ceo from the executive officer from central new south wales joint organisation welcome jenny jenny 's going to give us a bit of an overview of what 's been happening at the jo so i 'll turn over to you jenny thank you thank you very much it 's always wonderful when um the it works eventually um i understand sharon you 're putting the presentation up for me is that correct thank you so folks um i 'm here this is the first time i 've delivered one of these in this format so please bear with me um it 's pretty exciting to actually be delivering and talking to a council at all and how a room together at the moment that 's um that 's really rather wonderful it 's all just been such an isolating experience has that of the last few months so it 's jenny from the jo here um with your annual presentation on how the joint organisation is traveling um and if we can have the first slide i can 't see can i see us where the slides are up to sharon the first slide is transitioning from central to the central new south wales joint organisation and as you can see we have 10 members now as part of the joint organisation whereas the old rock used to be a much bigger entity and i think i 've spoken to you folk in the past about the primary differences between what was centroc and the joint organization is the fact that we 've been regularized under the local government act now and the primary difference in that new role under the regular under the um state legislation is that we are working more with the state now while those words might exist in the legislation it is those words come true there has been some investment by the state in that improved relationship with um local government through the regional through the joint organisations however at the moment it 's still definitely a work in progress so if we go to the next slide which is about focusing our efforts uh thanks thanks very much and folks thank you so much for your patience it 's really very difficult delivering these presentations online and sharon look thanks very much for um working through this with me at the moment um so we are focusing our efforts at the moment we have to do a thing under a local government act called the statement of regional strategic priority please have a look at our website and that will show you what the short two pager is in that regard and then the other plan that we 've got is the central new south wales strategic plan which we actually developed at mayfield gardens a number of years ago and this plan has been extended now by 12 months as a result of covid and i 'm sure all lifespan too as councillors of your term and in fact at that meeting uh last friday with the deputy premier there was there was a suggestion that that may even extend further um i 'm sure a lot of fica came to actually get on with our next round of elections though next slide please sharon so as i said earlier working with the state is the big difference technically for the joint organization and so one of the things that we are doing at the moment is a lot of work in planning you would be aware that there is a regional border strategy including oberon at the moment it 's for the macquarie and for your perspective the upper macquarie that 's re that 's involving a lot of consultation there 's also a regional transport strategy which was actually due to be delivered earlier this year that hasn 't happened yet and we 're chasing up where that 's up to and they 're also about to review and relaunch the central west and irana plan so that 's been quite a bit of work in the regional plans there 's also quite some work in implementation and monitoring and one of the points that this joint organization always says is there 's no point in writing a plan that 's going to be shelfware we want to see implementation we want to monitor those outcomes that the state is talking about for our region so that is something that we 're very engaged in at every step of the way and one of the critical things for example around our regional water strategy is we just need the state to stay with us as we do implementation monitoring otherwise we are of a view that um and that 's what i say we i mean all the councils across the region working to collaboratively develop policy positions and one of our great concerns is the next round of drought if we don 't have our state partners working with us where our local water utilities our local water getting to our communities are at great risk so implementation monitoring is really critically important to us program delivery is an area which we 're doing with working a department of planning industry and environment program happening in energy so this is a really interesting project working with the state where they 're actually investing we can co-design what the investment is they 've got to mou with all of the councils across the region and all the way across central new south wales now i think every lga has its own energy plan that there it 's either completed or near completion and then a number of other projects are in play that 's a really interesting and different approach by the state so instead of it saying you will compete for this piece of funding it 's saying would you like to co-design how we 're going to spend money in your region and that 's definitely a much better model from our perspective another question that we 're really challenged with quite frankly in central new south wales is how do we do regional development with the state uh whether i can see you know matthew webb 's online good to see you here again maddie after our earlier conversation today on tourism but it state on regional development it 's really not a very coherent or very strategic approach and it 's something that i think as as a as a group of councils um providing advice to your next council that is a real challenge and something that i think we should be taking up regionally what we have been doing in this region is a thing called the regional prosperity subcommittee chaired by a mayor having a number of state agencies involved so that 's a little bit different because usually the state agencies aren 't widely enthusiastic about working with elected representatives however it doesn 't seem to be making very much progress and so it brings back that question about how do we do regional development with the state and finally the jo must work with the regional leadership executive so that 's all the state agencies um sit in a room every quarter and talk about how they can do things to together in a more coordinated way we are doing one particular project with them at the moment around getting state data to um integrated planning and reporting in that regard next week so that 's just an example of how we are trying to work with the state um i could honestly say there 's wild amounts of traction there but it 's it 's possibly better than it was as as a rock next side please so what 's hot at the moment there 's a review of joint organisations it was due last year then it was due this august it 's now september we are hoping that that review will come before this round of councils finishes their term so if i can give some consideration to how we work with how we work with our jos into the future there are challenges for the broader network so rjo is one of the learning joes in the state at the moment however other jos are not working as well for a variety of reasons and that 's pretty hot at the moment so what is going to happen with the whole jo framework altogether is something that 's a big topic of discussion across the state um tourism is pretty hot at the moment at the moment called the longer long weekend and the idea there being extending the stay of people in our region and that was what we were just talking with matthew about earlier today it 's just hot off the press that one um and really it 's about making or suggesting to people who have you know come and had a taste of the region just for a couple of nights in the past come and stay in the region for four or five nights and so in particular you avoid that dreadful drive back over the mountains on a sunday afternoon with that bumper-to-bumper traffic so it 's about trying to push people to have a longer stay and a better experience we 've also and in the building better regions fund round five the announcement on that fund has been extended so we don 't know whether we have whether our cbd project is going to be successful but that is a project talking about how we reimagine our cbds as um you know shopping behaviours change over time so a lot of people are doing their and so they 're vibrant and important places for us into the future the next project is an inland rail productivity enhancement program 100 funded by the state and that 's about how do our small to medium enterprises in region access inland rail and develop value from it it 's being developed through ernst young at the moment we 're doing a project best practice in aggregated procurement so how can we deliver even better on the substantial savings that the jo delivers for you through the contracts that it manages skills and housing has come up and the jo has just been appointed to the department of education skills and employment i think i 've got it the right way around the federal department has got a task force in region and um the jayazar represents you represent you there in that regard however skills and housing is a real emerging problem um i just read a wri report only yesterday suggesting that over the next five years we 're looking at 64 000 potential jobs in construction in other industries with all of the work and stuff moment i think that number 's probably too big however there are there is a growing number of need for jobs in region at the moment we don 't have the people and we certainly don 't have the roofs to put over their heads um there 's also the raising of the wall at by angela now twerk that 's that 's twr town water risk reduction program um you might have seen if you want to have a quick read the auditor general 's report on how uh the state has been supporting local water utilities very poorly and what things and what should change there there 's a lot happening um in the water space at the moment and finally tunnels you might have seen that the state is looking at actually linking two tunnels from the let 's go end all the way through to medlo bath so that would be pretty exciting i think but it 's a long way off so don 't get too excited but the fact they 're thinking about it is pretty exciting the joint organization board position is we 's on the horizon well there 'll be a new board after december um we 'll be reviewing the joint organisation strategy looking at your community strategic plans and other strategies such as tourism the work being done by the water utilities alliance the joint organisation review the regional water strategy and various other documents so um in in our review of that plan we will be having at this stage we 're looking at having a major event as a result of the survey work we 've been doing with our mayors and thank you very much um cathy sedgwich for your feedback um to that strategy we 'd like to get all of our new councils coming together to have an event we 're thinking it might be something like wicked in the west to try and talk about our wicked problems if you 've got some views on whether you think that 's a bit of an unfortunate title please come up with a better one and put it in the chat i 'm looking forward to some good ideas about what we can title our event council laws from across the region together and talk about what these really wicked problems are and a particular one that 's come out in at times is health if you look now at on the rural doctors network at the number of and this is just doctors not all health workforce and i appreciate there are other areas of health workforce but they actually have they actually need more doctors in the region now than they did three years ago and that 's despite everything that 's being done for bringing doctors into regional new south wales i think we are going backwards at the moment so these are wicked problems that people have been applying some thought to for a number of years and we 're not getting very far far forward so we want to talk about those really really important problems to our region and what potentially we can agree about them and even some short-term solutions that we could potentially do in region so next slide please sorry is that should i have i 've got a question or something ready man no they 're background noise okay thank you so look while all that 's happening uh the joint organisation continues to live it to deliver cost savings to oberon council and it 's really important for us to be able to say look we have saved you money um and so you know in in in the last financial year we have saved you 97 000 through participation in in our various programs across the region now i 'm happy to provide more detail on what on what that looks like you can see that this is just about the different contracts um that we have been providing in the region so that 's just as a result of our procurement function next slide please um this is about um the other programs that that we run all right so this is showing um what your spend is over the region on those varying contracts um has been 833 000 a lot of that expenditure as you can see is in supply contracts and energy contracts next slide please so talking about um the cost savings just on electricity for the last three 're looking at you 'll save close to 35 000 over those three years next slide please at the same time we also provide a whole lot of submissions so you can have a look at our website we 're constantly providing submissions we get feedback from your council about what it is that your concerns are and how you would like to respond in these submissions and please have a look at any of those up on our website next slide please um we are constantly developing new contracts at the moment we 've got a total of 29 contracts with over 42 contractors and that 's constantly growing next slide plays we also um run a whole lot of project teams across the region um in transport uh award utilities alliance the planners group tourism managers energy group i.t managers whs risk hr managers and training and learning and development and what this means is that your staff talk to the staff all the way across the region and they share experiences problems they 've got someone that can pick up the phone and have a chat to and they get tips and tricks all of these groups have also got a strategy they typically ask for contracts to be run on behalf of our procurement team um that actually you know develops better practice across the region so for example the rt managers did cyber security that sort of stuff 's going on all the time next slide please we also work with other joint organisations we 're working with three joint organizations the south on southern lights which talks about led deployment same group around best practice and irrigated procurement this joint organisation actually leads all joint organizations in the state all working with all the executive officers around the funding framework and joint organisation sustainability and working with the state on a systems approach next slide please so just a quick one the southern lights project it 's been led by riverina jo so it 's great they do all the heavy lifting overall oberon installations on led lights are underway now as of once as of the first of september 484 leds have been installed of the total 498 lights in service next slide of work and that particular picture there i think that 's from the australian the australian traveler march 2021 uh thanks to maddie he 's been a great supporter and um a great resource so all of our tourism managers share information and matt is a leading tourism manager so you 're very lucky folk in oberon to have matt he 's always thinking of great good new ideas and provides support into the region as well so we did in the last financial year get 2.44 million worth of public relations value um and over 840 000 dollars in equivalent advertising value really for a comparatively very small spend and that was up from 1.5 million the last year so it 's um it 's but the tourism uh programming is doing very well next slide so that 's just you know a quick overview of what we 've been up to um i hope i haven 't taken up too much of your time thank you very much for um yeah having this year 's presentation first time i 've done it online i hope it wasn 't questions absolutely councilman kevin um thank you madam mayor um jenny i could just ask you about the inland rail productivity yes corey um in relation to that obviously one of the biggest issues about connectivity to the inland rail at parks or wherever from places around here and in fact um to the sydney basin is the state of the railway um between east and lithgow and then i 'd have to say let 's go obviously to penrith obviously we 've got a new battery creek airport as you 're very aware going ahead um and we have connections to port botany but we 'll also be needing connections to parks and that may be as far as from here and obviously from lithgow what is the what is the jao doing in trying to influence the government at the very least bearing in mind that they 're bringing these new uh locomotives that can to replace the xbt that can operate on electric or in a diesel electric mode to do something to at least straighten the rail line between lithgow and bathurst noting that there is line running from over onto taranak to connect into that line and also ultimately noting that these locomotives uh can quite easily travel in tunnels because they because they don 't have to get rid of emissions because of the nature of these of tunneling under the blue mountains to the to uh basically the nepean from lithgow because freight is becoming more and more important obviously passenger side of it is an adjunct but the freight side is becoming more and more important and there may well be stuff from western sydney in particular coming through the mountains out to parks to link in with the inland rail to either go south or go north to toowoomba and ultimately to brisbane so that 's um there 's a lot to unpack in that question and i 'll answer i 'll just tell you what we 're up to basically around rail including freight rail at the moment so you 'd be aware that the state government has been working on what they 're calling very fast rail although i think in our region the bureaucrats are calling it faster down a bit by the time it 's got over the escarpment um this region so two parks is included as one of the the train lines um and this and i 'm aware that the transport for new south wales folk in our region are advocating hard for that work to happen jail policy at the moment is that we certainly want to see those linkages this side of the mountains so that 's between orange and bathurst and then between bathurst and lithgow to if we can straighten those pieces of the line out that would actually really facilitate um growth of development and vibrancy across those three larger communities in the central west so there 's one piece that 's happening we 're also developing we have an existing strategic alliance called the strategic transport group this is now going to be administered by transport for new south wales and the point there is that they are going to bring all of their different sort of bureaucratic weight in working with our elected representatives so our mayors in the region to advocate for the outcomes that we that which is working with western sydney so our our group of councils is working with the western sydney dialogue to build those relationships back into western sydney particularly aiming at that western sydney airport we do have and i 'm happy to share it with you send you a copy of our advocacy policy which does include that work around faster rail so i hope that 's a little bit of what we 're doing certainly it has been challenging i guess it is the heart of where we 're going to get to in all of that there should have been a central western iran transport plan should have been out in january of this year as i said earlier it hasn 't happened yet so we 're pushing we 've got this meeting with us um with the new this new transport group led by transport for new south wales and we 're saying where is that transport plan up to so there 's a few things that um you know i guess we 're pushing along uh in support definitely of faster rail and just going it 's looking at what they 're calling a consolidation center so how do we pull together the um the product from small to small to medium enterprise across the region for to to be consolidated so it 's suitable to go on to inland rail and then potentially for export so that 's what that particular project is specifically looking at thank you um work that the jio are doing i understand um and we get quite a lot of information about the white angler project um it was mentioned there in the slides about oprah was included in that um that uh update we 're just wondering if if the jo is aware or if they are pushing the um the project that we 've raised several times about a pipeline from the duck beloy will you the waiver on damn it 's uh i don 't know whether you know but it 's only a relatively short section of pipeline and would go a long way to our area and uh areas towards uh this government arrowing and even some extent down to blue mountains just is the water security update in in the agronomy yes so um the regional water strategy um for the macquarie includes the upper macquarie which includes overall so they are looking at a variety of those projects at a strategic level so they may not get down to every single project but they will actually articulate a number of projects and duck malloy has been raised also the the broader security around oberon dam to ensure that it provides a level of security for the township of oberon and so we 're discussing things like false flaws in dems and what they might look like there is actually a false floor over at lake windermere for example in the castle ray um and that has ensured that no matter how ugly the stochastic modelling gets with the community of maggie they will never run out of water they have the most secure water supply in regional new south wales and that 's because they 've got a false law so it we have raised those sorts of things with um with the state and certainly the duckworth piece has been raised i don 't does is there a counsellor in the room who knows the difference in lift between that duck malloy we and the oberon dam because one of the things that 's starting to happen in region now is conversations around um around the nexus between energy security and water security uh using that those those sort of that damn hydro sort of i can 't remember the exact word for it but that yeah perhaps a charged hydro system is that what you mean it 's a pumped hydro that 's it pumped hydro so um thanks councillor um so that 's i 'm not sure what the lift is between those two water storages but i know that central tableland 's water is having a look at something like that at the moment they 've put in a submission to the reason the re the recent pump hydro eoi um i haven 't had a chance yet to get back to you chris and have a talk to you about that but there could be some potential um in the over on in the oberon and the don 't know again i don 't know the difference in height between those two but we are able to if you want if there is any potential just as a back of envelope um exercise please let me know after this meeting and we 'll send a guy in called evan from charge works to come in and just have a look at some high level feasibility so you guys could potentially pursue that down the track because what we 're thinking at the moment is is we might be able to get the infrastructure outcomes that we need from an energy security project to deliver the water security that we need if that makes sense and that certainly seems to be the case in the central tableland system so that 's the lake roland system thanks jim we 'll get those speakers to you thank you what is the current situation in relation to the y angler and also what is the commitment from the government in relation to the tunnel only go up to i think it 's now the other side of medlo bar because we commitment yes it 's made a commitment but that 's absolutely certain we 've all received pamphlets showing that the the long tunnel um and it 's going ahead but we just i 'm just not certain as to how has the as the government actually signed contracts for it to implement it or it 's still in the feasibility stage and it hasn 't reached that stage and the same questions i suppose in relation to why angular there have been a number of documents circulating saying commitment then we hear that there are department bureaucrats actually querying the feasibility of wi-angla and then we hear it 's back on and it 's got the full support of all the local councils which we know but we still do not know whether the government has absolutely committed to that project either i suppose i 've got one word for you counsellor submarines well if with the greatest of respect i used to work for a french company [Laughter] and it was a shareholder in that company naval so very appropriate comment to me um so look i i will board with the deputy premier he was very strong on the commitments that the government has made particularly to why angela so if if the elected representatives have their way um then you know you know for example deputy premier barolaro look i think that there would already be shovels in the ground and things happening it 's just a much it 's a much slower process that you have to go through treasury um and as we all know the longer and the slower those processes are the greater likelihood is for them to be derailed so i think the elected representative commitment is there similarly with tunnels i think we actually have some um certainly a much stronger commitment from the bureaucracy regarding channels um the tunnel doesn 't go to the eastern side of medlo bath by the way still on the western side of medlo bath which we think is you know not grow as good as it could be the longer the tunnels are better um having said that you know i think there is strong commitment to the tunnels but again no boring machines oberon council could do to support those types of major developments is to write to minister kane asking him to review the methodology for the bio security calculator so the the problem for the biosecurity offsets calculator is generating some really big numbers for y angler and other significant projects that is making their their benefit cost ratio not as good as they should be and in fact those numbers and you you may well know from some of the development going on around the oberon area it 's certainly apparent elsewhere that it is making the chances for certainly larger developments less likely because they become so wildly expensive and the deputy premier gave an example when speaking to the joint organisation board of of the cost of the wild dog fence so obviously it 's a wild dog fence to look after the environment of western new south wales the cost of that wild dog fence is nearly doubled so i think it goes up to 78 million dollars instead of 40 million dollars as a result of the bio um of of that that biodiversity offset our uh just back onto the duck malloy weir um there could be some value in uh this hydra i guess pushes the water up there 's a ridge between the two rivers so and there 's probably about 100 to 140 metres up the top of the ridge about halfway along then at the gravity feed the other 4ks down to the dam so the sucker where is lower than the dam at the same time if you were pumping half the journey of the uh gravity fed so that might be of some value if we could get some good information there yep thank you thank you very much for that and i 'm sorry i didn 't come to that to you guys with that earlier i sort of came up as a result of some work that we completed recently with sanitable landscapers so chris chris you make a scientist to drop that on on you today it really it 's another it 's just another sort of fresh piece of information so if we can get some further feedback on that we can get back to the pay for the back of envelope feasibility for that work for you thank you any more questions council mccarthy just a couple for jenny jenny um bennett there 's more water in the duck memorial than what there is to fish that 's why it 's so important um the second one was is next time you 're here we 'd like to take you down the sidewalls and show you if the state government fed england about making the rail faster and the other one was it 's over ten years ago when i attended a meeting at hartley with a large amount of councillors from over and in other places talking about the tunnel down mount york when do we get the start the state government to stop talking and start acting and putting dates on these projects look we 're closer i guess that 's all we can say um we are closer i mean the issue for us at the moment which is why we brought in this this project called the longer long weekend is people coming to our region and leaving our region and there 's that 's not going to be fixed by a tunnel anytime soon so i think on the one hand yes we 've got to keep the asset on the state government to make these things happen as soon as they possibly can but the other is that we 've really got to protect our reputation to our visitors in in the short term and look for strategies to get them to stay longer so they don 't have that terrible congestion um heading up the mountains because that was that was has been really bad when kobe sort of comes comes off again so we think that we 're going to have that dreadful congestion again and we 've really got to do something about that thank you jenny there 's no further questions thank you for coming along this evening thank you always a pleasure i really look forward to seeing you guys in person soon hopefully soon good night jenny okay bye-bye thank you okay on page seven item seven questions from the public the public

residential excuse me could i just ask him yeah while you 're speaking here see you soon thanks for robin wiseman resident of oberon madam mayor general manager councillors and sharon good evening madam mayor i would like to put forth my questions and thoughts on the agenda 1005 adversity with vaccination are you aware that the copenhagen vaccine is currently in a trial stage until 20 2023 and council go down this road of mandatory vaccination which is not a legal requirement according to greg hunt mp minister of health and aged care vaccination remains voluntary and the government respects the person 's choice to make an informed decision on whether to participate in australia 's covered 19 vaccine rollout is the council aware that the tga figures show 55 067 16 sorry 55 000 and 16 adverse reactions and injection who will be in responsible responsible for any adverse reactions or death especially when employees lives could involve young a young family and mortgage debts and other costs do you think it may be better outcome if the accounts will allow due to the amount of different injections coming into the equation that the employers are able to make an informed decision with their doctor 's advice are you aware that there are other variants from africa called mu and from california a stronger variant called lambda there are reports that no there is no protection from these variants from any of the vaccines available are you aware that there are court challenges happening here in australia regarding mandated vaccination i 'm asking please be australian and allow staff to allow their own informed choice in this matter allow them to govern their own lives and work out what is best for them with their medical doctor make a stand and stand up for your fellow australians staff and your community thank you thank you page seven until eight confirmations the recommendation is that the minutes of the ordinary arising i 'll put the recommendation on but i ask you to put on your mask if you 're not speaking first page eight counselors item nine member in report the recommendation is that the report item 0901 is received with information could i have an over please counselor given the council okay that 's from kevin do you wish to speak to this thank you madame as i suppose we always say it 's been a very busy month for you um i 'd just like if i could to ask um on page 10 the last item on that page there any further correspondence the council 's not aware of regarding that um fish river pedestrian bridge or is it basically just correspondence has been no commitment no we had a meeting with there 's been various correspondents going backwards and forwards and then we have had a meeting with transport from new south wales um we have somebody now in charge of the project and they 've found some money to do a feasibility study of options for the bridge and we 've let the stakeholders know to be done thank you and if i could the one two three four fifth i 'm on page 11 which was the meeting with um stuart i think yeah that was the correspondence sorry correspondence um noting glenn 's position um is anything arisen as a result of that the correspondence um no we are awaiting a meeting at the moment when favored restrictions lift and people can come in at adam shire without you know with the isolation thing that meeting will go ahead and if i could madame as you know it 's close to my heart here 's the third last item on page 11. it was that which is the um letter from well i 'm assuming it 's the letter from andrew g providing a response from telstra regarding the progress of installation small cell was that the one that was circulated to councillors yes um madame i 'm very happy to move the recommendation with this report being accepted by council thank you councilman that 's the people thank you very as usual a very full two or three pages of activities um local government new south wales update on opposition to infrastructure contribution reforms was attended by councillor callum who could you or council killing a bit of background on that i 'm happy to pass to councilman i 'm sure we 'd be happy to give you some background thank you madame um councillors the webinar was about the state government 's infrastructure contribution reforms which is a direct response to the productivity 's productivity commission 's investigation into contributions by developers now the outcome of the that particular examination was 29 [Music] recommendations but the overarching view of the commissioner was that the current contribution system is lacking in transparency and is inconsistent so the the main thrust of this particular piece of legislation is to reduce contributions by developers and in concert with the ipad review of rate pegging to transfer a proportion of currently possible infrastructure contributions from the developers to ratepayers and the way that would be done of course is that we would then we 'd have had the rate freed up and what we might lose in contributions would then then make up the shortfall things which were pointed out in fact by the commissioner the legislation as it exists is a very short bill and it provides great scope for administering the act by the regulation which provides immense opportunity for bureaucrats and ministers to change what may be cast in parliament at their own web we are in the early stages of actually understanding the full implications of this particular bill mainly because the rate pegging review has not been completed and we don 't know what the outcome of that will be so that has to be provided secondly there is what 's called the essential works list which uh ipark also needs to do which is which which puts boundaries on what those developer contributions can be spent on and the last thing is there needs to be visibility of what proposed regulation from the state government will be um now the state government has come sitting in sorry state parliament sitting in the 26th of october uh it is not likely that they will pass the legislation then because uh there has been another house parliamentary meeting review this and the legislation cannot be passed at the moment because of the lack of the right peggy review the regulation or the essential work list now if the state government does try to do something like that it 's a reasonable expectation that without a majority in the upper house that legislation won 't get through however it is a major change to the way the founding principles of how we do infrastructure within the lgas and basically uh it 's always been based upon the person who is either causing the impact or is getting the benefit out of the redevelopments or the developments pays the contribution and rate payers pay for the upkeep through rates and that 's been the traditional way of doing it now for generations and this is a significant shift in that um the local government new south wales is is mounting a significant campaign um which i think is quite easy to support this is a complex issue and i 've spoken with the general manager of the mayor and general manager is going to bring back a report at the next meeting to this and uh and perhaps pass a resolution we didn 't want to do it this time this particular meeting because putting out late reports it 's not a good way of doing business if you can avoid it and we can continue to support local government new south wales over the next while until the resolution is made by this council thank you is it a good idea for us to be broadcasting this far and wide to our business organizations our uh rural ratepayers because it 's the ratepayers who are going to be paying the penalty for for this activity if i 'm reading the what i 've read about it through the week so i think that really hasn 't been very much said by other organizations as far as i 'm aware business organizations but they might be winding themselves up with a little bit of luck but i think we could probably do our bit in this area to to stir up some of the business organizations happy to send anything on to them i think it 's a good idea to have a to a resolution of support um and that 's where we can deal with this issue it 's really we 've got an overview through the correspondent and i think um we 'll get a comprehensive report back in october thank you any other comments counselors councilman kevin sorry it 's just a follow-on from councilman cable 's comments and deputy i was wondering if there 's any possibility of um obviously there 's an extensive issue of getting that report um a little earlier than normal so that we have some time to consider it because i think we may need to look at that and we might have to go back and do some research as well but obviously i think we need to be a fully informed council making a really good recommendation that a little earlier than the standard time frame um i think that would be good and that 'll also allow us to circulate a few ideas or do something before the next meeting thank you just not only yeah um yeah your second i 'll point in on page 11 madam me your control center um greg sims the general manager sue ployd has now resigned or he 's no longer there he 's been a phantom general manager for over two years um but the mitigation crew that was based over there i think is now down to zero before there might be one person needed was three votes but at a meeting we had all the rsl pub with shane for simmons it was told by the rank and file there that if that 's not maintained to a certain degree whether it 's monday wednesday and friday um uh rural firefighters want to go back and stand on their own like in chiefly chiffon is made up of bathurst and abram and lithgow luthgo standalone um but at that meeting at darussal pub was made perfectly clear to shane simmons if that gets closed they want to get back to being just over here check that comment thank you councilman thank you any other comments he comes with with the recommendation all in favor page 13 councillors item 0902 election of mayor and deputy mayor i will now hand over i vacate this chair can i just thank the council for their support over the past period of time i really do appreciate it thank you um thank you madam mayor it 's my duty tonight to undertake the role of returning officer for the um elections of both mayor and deputy mayor at this point in time i have one nomination for mayor being counsellor kathy sadduce is true and accurate application under the regulation i now need to ask whether there is any other if there is no other it is my pleasure to re-elect um councillor cathy said it 's the role of me congratulations it is now my duty as a returning officer to undertake the election of the deputy mayor at this point in time i have won that nomination for deputy mayor that being uh councillor mark kellum it is a true and accurate election form or nomination form under the regulations i now ask is there any other with that being said uh congratulations councillor kellum to be returned as they 're now being undertaken i 'll hand back to the mayor to i 'd now like to uh propose to bring item 1301 forward on page 58 um just for procedural continuity if i can get a seconder during that it 's ongoing council operations september to december 2021 and it 's age 48 foreign thank um obviously um due to the short time frame to the next council election and being approximately three months it makes it sorry well what we have been told the short period for the next election it makes it abundantly sensible that we should reappoint um our representatives to their current section 355 committees um and delegates to organizations and so that we can keep the same person along those organizations for the next short period until next election obviously after the next election which currently scheduled for the 4th of december 2021 i believe um there will be reappointments to each of those committees by the new council can i just drop you there counseling given please i have not put that yet to the vote that we bring that forward so it 's all in favor of bringing his idol forward oh right i i 've said my piece so i don 't think i need to say it again no that 's fine i didn 't want to interrupt you yeah fine sorry um so i would be i 'm very happy to move this recommendation thank you the recommendation is that council will reappoint its chair and council of representatives to its section 355 committees other council committees and working parties as per the existing delegates until the end of the current term of council the council reappoint its current delegates to external organizations as per the existing delegates until the end of the current term of council the council note the requirement for council to re-endorse its model code of conduct within 12 months after each ordinary election section 440 of the local government act note that the requirement for council to endorse this model code of meeting practice within 12 months after each ordinary election section 360 of the local government act and that council will note the requirement for council to adopt a policy outlining the payment of expenses and provisional facilities to councillors within 12 months of the a move i have a secondary council on the cuban who spoke and is there any other comments on this one councillors i 'll put the recommendation when david perry thank you notices of motion 10.01 dart street stormwater drainage the motion is that a report be presented to council detailing options for council 's review and budgetary budgetary consideration of funding for drainage work associated with the lack of pipe stormwater infrastructure at the bottom end of dart street adjacent to the residences of number nine and number five that 's mccarthy in proposing that motion there 's no is there a second of councillors also givens mr council mccarthy do you wish to speak to the motion ah it 's pretty forward it 's an area that needs a bit of drainage whether it becomes curtain-gutted or drainage um whether it becomes a long-term plan but anyway it 's there before you thank you council council the last paragraph i think that reference should be the 21st should not should be the next council meeting in october not the 21st of september should it not alright from that favor unanimously thank you page 16 councillors item 10 0 10 002 tracking of development applications there 's a motion there councillors but over on council in in the director of planning and development month from report we provided with a flow chart of all development applications submitted to over on council showing submitted date commence date on which staff act pause date and time if any more information is required completion date of assessment and when it is determined and ready for happening or proceed and date available to applicants is there a segment of that motion thank you councilman carthage you wish to speak to them yes certainly do council need to track the va 's as on the new south wales new portal um your da doesn 't start with the submission until you pay the fees we need to know when this first consultation is when the process starts so that we can better serve our community but what we see in july meeting council dealt with a development we voted on it and you think it 's released in august a week later after our that they still haven 't got the determination like what are we doing five weeks after we do with it we should be the last line in other words any modifications they all come back to the council for consideration so five weeks after these people haven 't received their da and they 're waiting for their builder to commence work they 're waiting to get put in line but we didn 't know that until that lady told me that hang on we haven 't_''_3686.72 got it so i run the director and the director told me sitting on his desk he hadn 't dealt with it yet so these are things that we don 't know the other thing is when when we 're doing on the da 's um there 's people that have grant from the government sometimes it used to be twenty five thousand awards to build i think it 's got now cut back to 15 but there 's a time frame on it if they don 't get started then they lose that grant from the government it 's to start building and track we even need to know why these things haven 't_''_3728.96 been dealt with and we 're just told that no information or whatever but we should know the flowchart now with the director 's report it says that there 's a tracker well i don 't agree with that in respect that there was a da placed in june this year and i run on monday to find out where it is and he 's dealing with it now june so it wouldn 't have been on the website it wasn 't required at that stage but we don 't know about it you know other councillors don 't know about it unless you 're out in the community so this thing was submitted in june and is on the desk now this week that 's not right to our kids our ratepayers we track by report we track the amount of dogs that go the pound or the amount of cats that are in the pound but we don 't track these das this is not right what 's going on and the only way i think we the da 's was submitted the da 's not put online until apparently the fees are paid so you have this consultant period then you have the da 's and that 's when the va starts on the track and then you go back to information and the worst part about this is if you talk to one family that 's been consulted on an lido development and the slab was poured to secure the thing they get asked three lots of information provide the information next thing you know they 're getting another requirement for another lot of information not relevant to the first three questions we don 't know this is out in the community unless we have this flowchart that 's all i 'm asking i 'm not asking you to cut your wrists off cut your voice or anything all i 'm asking for a flowchart in the back of the director 's report where the va 's erupted thank you very much thank you technical yes i understand councillor mccarthy 's frustrations because this is a question that i also get asked quite a lot take so long for my da to be approved why is the process so um so long i understand that it 's bordering on operational but there is a frustration out there with some of our great players and some of our builders and if we can do something to streamline it make it quicker or have the information readily available that we can give people an answer straight away without having to come back to the office or the director or whoever 's involved it it certainly make it easier it 's it 's very difficult to to stand in front of someone and say oh i don 't know i 'll have to go and find out and then you know they just some of them throw their hands up and go what 's the use so i agree with council mccarthy it is frustrating in order to have no problem in supporting information okay i 'm not speaking against this motion because it is an operational matter and i don 't really know what the aim of the motion is counsellors and members of the public can they 're readily available councillors and the public can also track the aids through the da tracker that 's on the web or they can view the determination of council that gets a timeline it 's public information you can get at any time you can get it you can get it i can get it the applicant can get it at any time to find that information that 's been requested through the business paper i think would be time consuming because if you get a da that 's got issues and long time frames you 've got to substantiate those time frames in that report that 's giving out a lot of information and it 's taking a lot of extra time for our staff to do that when the information is available and also available through the director or the general manager council conducts pre-lodgement sessions meetings with all of their da applicants these are free of charge we 're the only council i know that doesn 't charge for this applicants need to take be aware of that maybe that 's something we need to put go when they lodge they do know what they need not everybody takes advantage of that and it 's a free service that we offer um and it ensures minimal delays um the current statutory um outcome for a da is 40 days from lodgement and since my time i 'm sitting here at vermeer i have not come across a deemed refusal through a time issue so i don 't know so i think the new staff are working well the process is slowly streamlining and i think that this is an operational issue and i i don 't think it belongs in the business programme does anybody else want to have a comment um thank you madam i suppose um i haven 't gone to the new portal to investigate what information is there um and maybe i could ask some questions of the director of planning if i could um firstly is it widely known that or that there are that it is deemed appropriate that there be a pre-lodgement meeting with anyone submitting a da is that widely canvassed in the community through the chair uh also on our website for uh when um applicants go to uh review what 's required for a lodgement they can um they will see that there is a required there is an offer for a pre-da meeting and it has been ongoing for a long period of time so my second question if i could madam through your madam mayor is if a da is submitted without all the required information in the portal is it considered submitted or it 's not considered submitted until all the relevant information is provided through the chair the application is not submitted until all the relevant information and fees are paid and then it is lodged right so the time clock really only starts running when all of that has been done is that correct through the chair that is correct yes um is it fair to say that during a month between our meetings there would be i suppose there 's a range but on how many da 's would be approved within a say a month between our council meetings or any month it doesn 't matter what people period determinations are in my monthly report uh councillor i realized that and i think there was eight eight last month but is that is that a good determination for an average it 's probably on the lower side to normal months uh sorry through the chair that 's why i asked the questions i realized there are one two three four five six seven eight i didn 't count that but i wanted you to to comment as to whether that was you know it 's more likely to be 15 or ranges from six to 15 or through the chair it does range from month to month depending on the number of applications submitted obviously earlier and uh how detailed those applications are and um director do you keep uh some sort of record probably outside the portal of da 's in process and at what stage they are and does that run from the time that they won 't use the word submitted because that has a connotation but from the time they initially lodge relevant material related to that da is there some sort of register you but we can 't deem it submitted because this this and this is missing through the chair yes we do council we have a spreadsheet that identifies which applications are sitting there uh awaiting information and also which applications once they 've submitted that information are waiting for their fees to be paid prior to them actually being lodged with council and is it correct to say that spreadsheet would then follow the process all the way through to approval for those for those all those those through the chair it would possibly be a separate spreadsheet counselor but we do keep track of those yes so director would it be feasible to have that so that you don 't have so bearing in mind uh council mccarthy 's notice of motion is it possible to provide a snapshot of those spreadsheets to council so that we can actually see where you 're at because that would require far less work than doing a new document as the mayor has suggested i i don 't see this necessary strategic because i think it is strategically as a council we need manner i obviously understand your position that if you don 't get all the information you know basically there 's a pause in in it but if we can understand that and if issues are raised with us as counselors you know we then are are much more informed to be able to say well joe blow that may be the case but we understand the council is waiting for lot more information you know if you provided that etc sorry and then then then head off the criticism much more easily and i think strategically we we have said we want our da 's approved in a short period of time and to obviously comply with 40 days so from that that point of view that 's why we 're looking at that 's why i believe councilman mccarthy 's looking through the chair um certainly a snapshot could be available as the mayor mentioned there 'd be certain um reasons why there is a stop the clock why why the clock has stopped um however i 'm available any day to take a call from a councillor and has been lodged at any time so that 's available at all times counselors and and those spreadsheets would obviously cover the issues raised by council mccarthy in his motion you know we may not use submitted date but the original lodgement date um and maybe you know it 's the then all the other things and then the official submission date would be in that spreadsheet and thereafter it would follow on i 'm just trying to i realize there may have to be a slight tweaking of the wording to fit with the word submission and lodgement thank you councilman counselor people thank you madam mayor um when i um read this um i have to admit that i did have some concern about it particularly that it really isn 't an operational issue and my immediate thought as i read it was all of those all of those issues that councilor mccarthy has raised could probably be more quickly um dealt with by a phone call to the director and and i think he said that madam now yourself um i think i think we 're doing that 's just absolutely unnecessary and um yeah i 'm i 'm definitely against it now madame and particularly the other thing is the more jobs we give directors to do the more it 's cutting into the time that we have that they have to do the things that we want them to do and we seem to be pretty good at doing that i think asking asking directors to give it give us more and more and more information without taking into account the time that takes those people to find that information and present it for us thank you censor um i think this emotion is more about a lack of understanding by the public and i 'm not criticizing my understanding how the system works the fact that all information needs to be gathered for the da prior to the fees being paid and that is the start point of this of the 40-day period um i have some sympathy for the council capital 's view that um we 're loading directors up each time with more and more uh reports when in fact um as the system works why it works and where they can get information and i think several people said you know you can just make a phone call the director or his staff and get an answer on where your va is many like i get a strong sense that there are probably a few problems with the da system but i also sense there are a number of problems with people 's expectations unrealistic the expectations of it and not an understanding of how the planning processes work thank you councillor councillor can we unmute cancer danny i 'm just seeking to unmute am i can you hear me thank you um i would uh support the last couple of comments madam mayor uh i think most issues that come up can be dealt with with uh communication with the professionals we have on staff i think um delays of course uh time is not the only outcome in a da it 's an application of standards it 's um it 's and it 's an application of key issues of uh the government 's local government 's responsibility through see gradually us become much better planners not just time being of the of the only issue um i think the director has pointed out that he is available for those issues uh building a house and real estate is such a personal point of view that people become very anticipatory about it and i can understand that that 's often more emotional thing than a practical thing so i i support us becoming better planners and i do not support this um this motion any other comments councils like a right of reply just made a met what i was trying to achieve is some sort of spreadsheet but just heard from the director that they actually use that so why isn 't it just printed in the back of their book i don 't want to be ringing up the director finally and wasting his time getting much information taking time away from when he could be doing his job wouldn 't it be easier if this spreadsheet is available in the its office just be printed in the back of their book and that 's all we the determinations i can from the cuban centers eight number one and number six through the same one so they 're the if you give it a mean you get frustrated and all you 're saying that other one that 's submitted in june how are we only dealing with it now it was breathable anyway if you 're happy to treat your great players like that than sober thank you very much i don 't think that comment was called sorry i was for it can i ask a dane counselor who is for this recommendation one two three four five emotions carried thank you councilman against could you get the game system against councillor dhoni councillor cable council witch and council california thank you page 17 councillors item 1003 trial of telehandler at over on waste depot the motion is that over on council trial a tele handler with a minimum two metre bucket and forks to be used at the over on tip that 's mccarthy you 're proposing that fashion have a second you have a second bath no second down has it given to you in the report it says that we have compactor we have a dozer none that can parry can carry the dirt i don 't mind losing this but this is some way of covering over the waste at the tip has been requested for over four years i think in the report that we got they suggested a front end later i 'm happy for that but have a friend and later with thoughts or whatever but do it don 't go what 's happening at the moment a big push to go and get all this stuff covered in one week it 's been sitting there it 's put into a disgraceful situation there 's more cover there than when i followed poor old council capable out there one day there 's more uncovered rubbish out there now than ever but i would say out there one day and i followed him and showed him that it had needed to be covered over that 'd be probably four or five months ago but it 's happening now but we shouldn 't have to to start this out they should and they haven 't got the means to do it they need some sort of machinery whether be a deli handler or a front end later buy something so it helps them out trial it first get the man there 's a backhoe significant i know whether the person can drive it or not but it 's not there all the time we need something currently out there so they can cover the rubbish and garbage that comes in as per the report and the vpa requirements thank you thank you council council are you just through the chair i i agree with something like a front end later with a big packet on it numerous times have been there and it 's a very busy fit now i think it 's a lot busier than it used to be and and time is of the essence whatever we 're doing and with the windy weather of rubbish blowing around i think it 's a great opportunity to get some something that can carry dirt and cover we 've got the material there to cover and it 's so much has their certain role in compaction and but to you know to have a backup there trying to do stuff that you know front-end later with different implements on it would be great for trial amendment but i 'd like to ask a couple of questions first if i could through you to the director of technical director of planning so the jsrs report as as being said obviously recommended the use of a front-end loader and i know that we have um and i think it 's in this council report um we looked at what was going to be done basically urgently then meet in a short term medium term and long term i just can 't recall whether the front end loader was in the short term medium term and long term and i apologize for that but i 'm sure um i could ask you director you recall through the chair um it is within the short to medium term uh recommendations counselor and it 's something that i 'd like to take on notice and consider as part of those short short term and medium plan is to bring back a report to council in october with some recommendations um madame if i could propose an amendment that the oberon council trial of telehandler slash front-end loader now i don 't know that a front end loader will necessarily have forks um all right with a with a with appropriate attachments i think but with appropriate attachments to be used at the over and tip for covering garbage in line with the jsrs report all right i think that ties into the report because we 'd already have a report on the tip it does recommend a front-end loader um and i know that yeah and so i think we need to tie it in with that um and i 'm i 'm then happy with the resolution hasn 't been [Music] um and very briefly madame uh it just would seem sensible to uh to be talking about an appropriate machine or a machine with appropriate attachments and because it 's in the short to medium term plan i think it 's a good idea to just start something happening thank you any other sorry ask counselor i 'm sorry thank you madame uh i appreciate the difficulty thank you for your patience with this arrangement um um i 'm reluctant to um force the hand of the professionals they need to make their decisions but i do certainly think that the um this key problem of the tip um and it 's um untidy nature is uh is something that we need to act on and i 'm i 'm happy to support the um the amendment comments counsellors i 'm going to put the amendment if i could read it sharon i haven 't quite written sorry my apologies that 's not going to let me move it across for some reason may i read it yes please um that oberon council trial a tele handler with a minimum two meter bucket and forks to be used at the overall the amendment my apologies that oberon council trial and tele handlers slash front end loader with appropriate attachments to be used at the oberon tip for covering garbage in line with the js rs report i 'll put that away i 'll amendment now becomes the motion all in favor carried thank you councillors okay 18 councillors item 1004 over on cemetery damaged grade the motion is that oberon council will reimburse robin hansen in full from damage caused to her mother 's grave euphemia boots this council givens are you proposing this motion yes and i have a second of counselling how 's your life [Music] do you want to hand out those you 've got them i think [Music] right so we had an unfortunate incident at the cemetery ago and i think it was a fairly ordinary day when it happened um i rang up the engineer about it after inspecting the damage from the tree and was trying to identify with the insurer i felt it was a different a different scenario when you have a tree that was planted by council compared to a tree that 's coming naturally in the cemetery and there are plenty of those big gun trees naturally growing i don 't think and i can ask the question whether it was completely identified to the insurers that this was a tree that matters or not we can all see the planning here and the four or five trees there took that photo then i looked down at the grave and the continuation of the trees and where the stump fell over so uh i could just ask first the process of what was transpired with the insurer was the insurer was it pointed out that the tree was planted by the council or we were just talking generally of trees in cemetery through the chair i can confirm that it um the question wasn 't asked whether there is a difference between there is a tree planted by council or it 's um naturally occurred right so we didn 't say this tree was planted by council and if we had it that wouldn 't have made any difference you know um through the chair makes no difference to us whether the tree is naturally forming or whether it was plenty of decay from what this premium from council 's perspective based on the general manager 's comment that 's been made so i believe that in no way was the interred the fact that the tree was planted 40 years ago that we should have some responsibility in dealing with it and uh i 'll just uh tell you a little bit about the lady that was buried there and her work in the community and well just brief us on last tuesday night here in this very hall we all agreed um i 'm not going too far into this i 'm just saying we so much appreciated the value of volunteering in our community and we all agreed what a great asset our town has with volunteering and how it would be impossible to put prices on this back to family contributions certificate of appreciation i failed to see excuse me what what mrs booth did in her life really is not impacting or shouldn 't impact on this decision but maybe it shouldn 't and she 's no more important or no less important than anyone else up in that cemetery i 'm just saying it wasn 't their fault she gave 35 years of service to this very council here i appreciate that this is a very one lady left in the family she 's very emotional and very upset when she saw the grace and she had a company to look at it and and to fix it up and that particular company didn 't want her to be paid until she sent the invoice to council but she didn 't work that way i 'm saying a person of great volunteering all alive a tree that we plan that no one 's responsible for falling neither us or the person in turn there but i feel that we have a responsibility to make sure that the people that are in turn there are safe and i think the community expectations are fairly high on this and it 's a one-off thing and what it will do will make us get a tree presentation order apple there as brenda line pointed out at that particular briefing and we can make this a one-off we can make this a one-off because of the trees that were planted there and i feel in this case that the council should front up and then be proactive in going around you all there is not another cemetery in our council area and there 's plenty of them without nature each planted no dangerous trees they 're all outside i think this is a one-off and in this instance that we should make the payments um because and and i guess everybody 's gathered trees are my thing we live in a climate where there are a lot of eucalyptus trees they have a capacity to break off branches fall off large trees fall over they have a very small root system we know that we have had an incident now gives us an opportunity to assess symmetry and if this when there is damage i was under the impression that an insurance policy would pay if the tree had fallen down the other way and no damage was done um you just go and clean it up but there was some damage done and i do not understand why it 's not covered by insurance it 's a property that we look after there 's often damage sometimes caused by the lawnmowers and things like that to the headstones to we 've got out there and i understand that families it is a sentimental thing and families feel that it 's their space because it 's their relative i as they say i second that second that we would should pay this or get the insurance company to pay for us thank you councilman the other comments here come from us [Music] i think we have a certain amount of responsibility uh it looks like our insurance isn 't going to pay but there must be a fund that we can actually fund the two thousand dollars that i proposed um in my time on council i think i can remember reports coming back like council line just said a minute ago that um damage to graze was done by some overactive lawn mowing people up there several times and we we just faced up and repaired the things so i think there 's a scope out there somewhere for us to run up to two thousand dollars and uh contribute towards the repair of this um grade that unfortunately has been damaged it 's um pity that it 's 's there um and it was a lightly constructed uh great headstone um but anyway it 's so can you read out your amendment counsellor or for sharon please the council provide two thousand dollars towards the um cost of thingy boos repair of their headstone and grade monument you have that challenge yeah oh i 'm sorry sorry counselor johnny you seconding this i understand that uh madame a long way away um yes i i 've been wrestling with this one quite considerably uh if there was if there was a hardship clause that i could find i 'd be much more comfortable because we could just justify it on those grounds but i and i know even if we amended the councillor mccarthy 's comment to say that this in no way admits liability it doesn 't i don 't know what we can say can we say in honor of previous community contribution to um to try to illustrate exactly why we 're taking such action but uh i would support that i know i do support that compromise motion and perhaps if it does fit council of gibbons have that this uh in honor of the um this community members contribution over many years so yes i support it any other paint on the amendment how 's the council capable horn mayor thank you i 'd like to speak against the amendment and the motion and i realize that this is a very emotive issue for a number of people but i think we have to look beyond that and and look at the consequences of the actions that we make that we might take if we go along with the nation um i think we 've heard that the trees were planted 40 odd years ago are we sure that they were planted by the council the community uh in those days and still now tends to do things we don 't know that it was the council if we got any if we got any proof or any record of the fact that they were planted by the council um that 's one of the the things that concerns me uh and the prison that we 're setting uh if there 's damage stuff up at the cemetery or as councillor gibbons said we 've got a number of cemeteries um around the place what happens if vandals get in there and break up headstones are we going to ask the council to to step up and repair that because these are the sort of things that that we 're bringing into the the debate um and i think we need to be very very careful of making these decisions and and i understand the the sentiment behind it and and i can um sympathize with it but i really don 't think that council can afford to step out and and and start doing this sort of thing um thank you madam i suppose my view follows that of um councillor capel however i would urge that if council is to proceed with either the motion or the amended motion that um consider putting without any admission of liability whatsoever and adding those words so do you wish to add that to this before we vote on that because once the well i 'm not [Music] amendment i would be suggesting that vote for the amendment or the motion but i am just saying for um it 's more like a excretion payment that it be those words we added i 'm happy to go back to the mover of the motion i 'm happy to have that installed if you don 't mind but the conversation just had for council cable was great in other words if we have this accident happen in our cemetery and there 's no living relatives left that headstone engraved stays in disrepair forever and i don 't mean except for and that 's why i proposed that we put the 2000 one off payment board without any admission of liability foreign to that addition to your amendment that you say condemn sorry madam mayor did you say that to me added to your to the amendment that you seconded uh may i speak on it just briefly i i i am but i would also like to see the comment um relating to service because saying that you deny your legal obligations if they are real has no impact whatsoever so we can say that an illegal whatever but it has no it has no impact in law at all in my is my understanding so i 'm happy for it to put it in to have it a shot but i would rather see the actual motivation for this uh amendment and motion being clearly more clearly stated and that is in appreciation of community service so if if if the patience is to include both elements i 'd be happy with that matter man i 've got a member sitting before me that 's had one one addition to it if you 're going to add another one i need to know what it is and it 's with the counsellor i 'm happy for the appreciation of commit past community service to be a dot point appreciation of the interns the former community service to the overall community what you suggested so i can 't_''_6366.96 be an act of goodwill councillor donai 's asked this to [Music] an appreciation of the service to the community could you read that out for us an overrun council reimbursed robin hansen to the value of caused her mother 's way in appreciation for service to the community without any admission of liability for the damage to the grave whatsoever i think we need to say appreciation of the interns community services not robin hansen 's i think it 's we 're talking about you for man booths i think sharon mentioned all right the 2000 's not half the it 's not i think it 's tricky and it 's been proved by the effective number of amendments and the number of points of view i 'm not sure where that leaves us in terms of precedent and i 'm not sure where it leaves us in terms of insurance or other accidental accidents within the boundaries of the cemetery i 'd like to hear some commentary from the general manager on those issues through the chair and let me start by saying also understand the remote nature of this um however it 's been made very clear that council doesn 't own the headstones so and that 's been highlighted in the general manager 's comment um the comments have been made on the precedent that this could set is one that 's a real risk as outlined in the general management so the pro the information that i 've provided in that generation comment is to give council laws an understanding of what a recommendation of this nature would potentially raise and why do you say that potentially and the risks are associated with that so i just provide that from a from a overall governance perspective um there are a couple of things that i also know i need to get some understanding from council and that is if you are looking to to reimburse where you 're looking to provide it from it 's the funding source now i heard a number of things about donation community service and that sort of thing and if if that was to be considered i 'd probably advise that it should be done under some type of donation provision under the 356 rather than any sort of maintenance requirement for the for the cemetery but there are there are the blue box highlights council 's positions can i ask do we have funding in 't but it 's a council 's discretion to in fact provide that if they want to do that what what it will do is um the donations budget will will um be overspent which will probably at an operational level bring your minor surplus into a minor deficit but as councils well aware we work every day to try and bring them all those wine items closer to the um surplus side of things as we as we do every day so what we come up with there is a next grass here uh payment to robin hansen of two thousand dollars and i think we just need to say to the system repair to the gravesite noting the mother 's previous service for the council are you proposing a further amendment this way okay counselor counselor kellum is proposing a further amendment what 's your first one first oh sorry are you further remember did you did you all hear the shadow of the member counseling could you read um for sure it is that um council approve an ex gracious payment of two thousand dollars from 356 mother 's grave noting their mother 's previous service on the council here did you hear that then council danny did you hear that foreshadowed amendment before we vote on the amendment yes he has yes i did okay i 'm going to put the amendment the previous amendment first which we need to deal with that we donate or we share and i 'll have to get you to read that out i 'm sorry that over on council reimbursed robin hansen to the value of two thousand dollars for the cost of damage caused her mother 's grave within a booth in an appreciation of the service to the community without any admission of liability for the damage to the grave whatsoever i 'm putting that recommendation counsellors all in favor against the most the amendment is defeated you now have a foreshadowed amendment you need it read out of game counselors well you 're right big scratch your payment let 's just read it out again i 'll get sharon to read that down it 's very difficult when i can 't see it on sprint sorry of two thousand dollars from section 356 funds to robin hansen for repairs to her mother 's grave noting um her mother 's previous service to council and the obama community do i have a second account wasn 't there a bit extra on that sorry am i allowed to second that or i will have one letter to ah no i don 't know that you can counsel i 'm sorry i thought that was correct he 's the mover of the original original [Music] mccarthy seconding that the amendment do you should sleep further council mccarthy do you wish to speak to any other comments counselors so i 'm putting the amendment all all in favor of the motion motions carried thank you councilmember all again again against one two three you get that sharing sorry that was so long but it 's something we really needed to sort of [Music] age 19 councillors item 1005 advocacy for coburn vaccination the motion is in three parts that council over on council right to the new south wales minister for local government and the new south wales minister for be made mandatory for local government councillors and employees and that we strongly re and that strongly recommended this measure be implemented by the 31st of december 2021 due to the work health and safety concerns that the cobart-19 virus could have on the local government sector b unions that represent local government employees to one advice that council is requesting the government to make it mandatory for local government employees to be double vaccinated and to request a meeting to commence consultation on making it mandatory for local government employees to be double vaccination to be double vaccinated against the kovit 19 virus on the basis of reducing a significant work health and safety risk in the workplace see that local to local government new south wales to seek support for the position of overall council in a bracket and b bracket council i 'm the killer you are on um thank you madam mayor um i need a secondary i need a second counselor there is one counselor thank you councilwoman wish to speak to the nation thank you madam mayor um i think we need to be health and safety issues noting that the further we go forward we 're going to have particular problems in the future if we have vaccinated workers partly vaccinated workers and non-vaccinated workers trying to work in the same physical environment without separation that 's going to cause considerable problems there are work health there are potential work health and safety issues um if people are picking up covered nine on the basis that people have not been vaccinated as we 're all aware um that vaccination mitigates the health effects of coca-19 and it reduces the potential spread of the disease um significantly reduces the potential for people to end up in icu or in hospital as a result of this insipid virus sorry and i believe that we as a council should be advocating for this to occur as you as as we 're all aware certain areas have already made it mandatory new south wales health department of defense in a lot of overseas jurisdictions it 's it 's even extended further you know if we don 't push the government or not seem to push the government and safety liability in the future um i believe that i we are not ourselves in in a position to actually mandate that all we are doing with this resolution is advocating and that 's very particular i noticed that we we obviously had questions uh earlier this evening that talked about over on council making this mandatory we are not making it mandatory this we are advocating and requesting um and that 's why very particularly the resolution has been resolved that way we all know that without vaccination and we all know what the new south wales government and federal governments are pushing for vaccination and that in the future you will be unable to access areas unless you have been double vaccinated and probably if you can prove it on your app that the new south wales government is introducing again people who enter our premises in the future our facilities are various facilities um where we have unvaccinated people entering those facilities that again could be providing a risk so all we 're gain doing is doing what doing what we believe is pro what i for local government the new south wales minister for health to go down this track and to do what we have to do under appropriate awards with the unions to speak to them and start telling them what we 're requesting and why we 're doing it and we 're also going to ask local government to support us in this in this area and as i understand that local government has been already making representations to the government in relation to certain of these issues thank you madame thank you councilman think about that i um i don 't think i could add uh any more to what councilman kevin has said but more as it stands um at the moment no state government has mandated vaccinations um the three mandate of the three large public service organizations that have are currently at the supreme court and that will be determined by the supreme court but that 's a legal command that they 've put out there i personally have no trouble with us writing to the minister for local government and minister for health what i have a with unions this is this is an enterprise negotiation this isn 't between a very small council and a small number of people uh that needs to be left to the to the office of local government should that ever come to pass so i think what we 're doing here is unnecessarily and unwisely sticking our head above the parapet which while there is still a lot of distance to go before um any sense of mandated vaccinations will occur i have no trouble though uh with writing to the minister for local government and new south wales for health suggesting that um we would support um a mandate on vaccinations mate which may be appropriate for councils council mayor i have some concerns about the whole nation but i would like to move an amendment please and it 's a very simple one to delete paragraph b so your amendment is just a and b a and oh sorry so the amendment now is that oberon council right to the new south wales minister for local government and the new south wales minister for health advocating won the for local government councils and employees and two strongly recommending this measure be implemented by the 31st of december 2021 due to the work health and safety concerns the code of 19 virus would have a local government sector c local big now bb local government new south wales to seek support in ay thank you council do i have a statement while i 'm happy to go along with writing a letter and advocating [Music] just that to to the the relevant government ministers um i really think it 's way outside the scope of um operations for the count for this council to start uh negotiating with the union so i think that 's that 's the job of local government new south wales if this happens to come to pass and i think that um yes as i say stepping outside the realms of responsibility for over on council so um yeah i 'm happy to go along with it without section professor mccarthy i 'm happy to support account for cable 's recommendation but my biggest disappointment i 've been following for a while and this 's going to end up in court because our prime minister hasn 't got the guts to move something that 's required for the nation mainly because of listening to the premiere last week and this is what i understood that she was passing the mr um passing it on to the employer if anything should happen so that it 's the employer 's problem if there is problems after the vaccination if there 's a death if there 's a adverse reaction and because the council is an employer of people it will be our responsibility and that 's why i would speak against it and that was the impression i got the premier was passing last week it comes from any other counselors yes i 'd definitely like to speak against it i believe this is a step too far with our freedom our choice the drugs haven 't the jabs haven 't run they haven 't been tested fully like you hear astro zenica and it 's going to be uh you know i 'll make a decision in 2010 to 22 whether you know for reactions job i just don 't think we can be forced to have something in our arm if we don 't want to that 's our freedom you know we 're given free will when we are here so it 's our choice it 's no one else 's choice and i 'm dead against it i 'll i 'll make my decision thank you councillor any other comments counsellors i 'd like to speak against the amendment um once i understand the intent of both the amendment and the motion i i can 't support it to me advocating equals supporting and i don 't think this council has come to a position yet or whether we support mandating um vaccination i 'm personally pro-vaccination but from a council perspective um i 'd know i 'd like to see more information read the risk and the liability but this term supporting [Music] mandating of vaccination would present to council i can think of several several just off the top of my head so this new south wales if we mandated vaccination service new south wales we would we wouldn 't it that 's just one example i think there 's lots of outcomes that we need to look at as a council more closely before we take a position on mandating or supporting the mandate the mandatory vaccination obron 's certainly not in a financial position to be a test case i think this needs to be left we need to see wait and see the body of work that the local government new south wales is doing what the outcome of that is um before we take a position and i think advocating to me equals supporting if we 're asking somebody to advocate on our behalf that means we support what we 're advocating for and this council hasn 't taken a position on that so i 'm i 'm against the recommender the uh amendment and the motion council dhoni did you have your hand up having dinner if there 's no other comments counselors or um wanna write a reply to them okay i 'm putting the amendment counsellors all in favor one two three four against one two three four five so the amendment 's there any more discussion on that motion counselors if not i 'm going to put the motion as it is in your business paypal all in favor against emotions defeated thank you councillors page treaty councillors um council on delegates reports 1101 central new south wales joint organization board meeting 12 august 2021. the recommendation is that council receive and note report item 1101 and i have a merchandise thanks for watching kevin um thank you madame a very full report um and um obviously a number of presentations the obviously we 've heard from um um the local head of the jo today jenny and um i note on page 22 further way down the pump hydro recoverable grants program and um i 'm wondering whether we can get our death malloy over on damn to that project some discussion i think jenny 's uh presentation the general manager is going to support that information in an attempt to do that yeah um well that was it was very interesting um and i know the comments made again by jenny in relation to certain representations we may be should his he was obviously presenting to that halfway down 21. so i have on great pleasure in um in moving the recommendation just before be accepted by council [Music] any further comments on this one recommendation all in favor thank you age 30 councilman 's 1102 upper macquarie county council meeting on the 6th of august 2021 the report is um recommended for information can i have a movement please counseling thank you councilman kevin um thank you madame um i think the rather extensive report so it speaks for itself i i did add i did give some indications of what the finances of the um of the macquarie county council were just for the information of councillors also i gave the tables of inspection reports which i think would be quite of interest to uh two councillors for reading i won 't go through those um but to note that um there have been a number of prop enforcement activities uh commenced um four four penalties have been issued in the ogron area and to further say that i did add a postscript because there have been several would be of interest to councils one is that unfortunately due to a number of issues the spring aerial spraying program um has been cancelled this is a worldwide shortage of flu proponent which is the chief serrated tussock chemical um and due to covert 19 there has been a lack of sign up by land holes a number of those land holes who would have done it being absentee land holders and obviously um from sydney and it 's been obviously difficult with the different designations of council areas within the upper macquarie in other words oberon is not an area of concern but bathurst is and blaney is to actually get inspectors to actually meet with land holders because they can 't travel from one area to the other um however there have been a number of activities taken by the uh county council including um arranging for orange helicopters who do have some supply of fruit propane to do some work uh directly with land holders and with uh um terralga rural who has uh have some quite extensive reserves of granular flu propionate to do some for the program thank you madam mayor obviously on his comprehensive report and the um the shortage of flu programming is i think a fairly major concern here in i mean we haven 't the county council has enough trouble um trying to get people to um deal with uh serrated tussock and there is ample opportunity for anybody who wants to do it to get into it because there 's a lot around um and now they 've got the fallback position to support them not doing anything because they can 't get the chemical um i think a major concern and i also fear that chemicals for dealing with thistles and other things that we have to deal with may also be in short supply as the season goes on because most of the active ingredient for a lot of the chemicals that we use comes out of china and as we know shipping between here and china is a difficult thing at the moment so i think the county council is going to have some some fairly serious issues over the next 12 months thank you councillor a good fire reading on the weekend and that was brought up for shortages of chemicals mainly the classic defendant i was told as a shortage of roundup as well maybe it 's an opportunity that someone in australia can start up restart up and provide that service in australia rather than relying on the door come from china good luck thank you you have commented with the recommendation oh sorry sorry counselor johnny no madam mayor i i was i was quick to vote [Laughter] thank you councilwoman 34 councillors committee reports 1201 local emergency management committee the recommendation is that the minutes of the local emergency management committee held on the 9th of august 2021 we received its information another please council capable councilman kevin people okay um just had a couple of people in the community um raised the issue of the change telephone number for the police station um it 's just no longer no longer or at the moment it 's not six three three six one thousand i haven 't dialed it but apparently when you dial that you record a message that says it 's not they they um quite another number to ring and said i haven 't read it uh i haven 't read it it was down to forgot is it a permanent thing or is it a i don 't know but maybe the general manager can take this to the next meeting we can just one question that was raised to me was well what if it 's an emergency and i don 't have a pen and paper to write down an eight-digit number and i get it mixed up and [Music] i just anything else councils on this one the recommendation all in favor okay thank you that 's 40 councillors 1202 traffic advisory local committee the recommendation is that the minutes of the traffic advisory local committee meeting he 'll end the fourth of august 2021 being received an information information can i have a move that 's on the cabin do i have a secondary that 's the heavens thank you madam mayor i have to say the attachments are very good but i have to say commentary actually doesn 't list the outcome on page 40. um yes the notification the cancellation of the north shore sporting club upcoming ams ag rally which is held within forestry um i think the action is that 's to be confirmed at a later date i would just ask that when someone summarizes the minutes and i 'm not the minutes are very good that you know the outcomes are actually listed it 's not things are not left um kenny uh on the genoan caves five mile and two mil access ways in the update as well as the commencement of the jollofs rship well what 's happening there was an outcome listed in here there was an outcome in relation to the abercrombie road intersection at sloggers road um and there was outcome about the overtaking lanes on dock malloy road and the safety concerns they are all listed in the minutes i agree but if we 're going to summarize can we please summarize the outcomes yeah i i 'm happy to to support this motion and to move the recommendation because the minutes are are very thorough but nothing wrong with them not encapsulate yeah and and doesn 't list the action what it should summarize what the outcome is yeah thank you councillor councillor gibbons nothing further mr kellum uh i mean i 'll disagree with uh kevin because i was there and in the minutes um the oberon street parking was brought up and um and i did say that um about the community using facebook to put their arguments up and that that 's where that 's been happening as well as some letters to the community but i also said that we needed to get on with the um accessible car park in outside the pharmacy and also get on with the trial for the parking lot now i would like to move an amendment to the recommendation and that is that the general manager come back with a report in october detailing plans for a trial and so and i don 't and i 'll put this down to a young and rapidly learning employee getting finding their feet we 'll have a second go for the amendment which would be um dot point two that 's general manager to provide a report to the october ordinary council meeting detailing plans for a trial line marking obama street and accessible parking at the overall pharmacy i 've discussed this with general manager and he will choose a particular area to do it look i don 't have a problem with the amendment but i don 't still think it derogates from my comments in relation to the commentary on page 40. so sorry so i think what counselor kellen says he doesn 't agree with my um comments read the minutes and i was not there at the actual minutes going from page 40 to 43 but i think my comments are still valid in relation to the summary on page 40. and i absolutely agree and the general manager will take that one sorry i just want to make that clear any other commentary here in the report before we put the private recommendation okay um on page 42 we 're on we did the amendment yeah okay you can put it now okay on page 42 you 've got an inquiry about the land on right um i thought i 'll recall that there was no more action in respect that yes we did uh purchased the ground but when we were able to do it with mr ray ross we ended up with the dual lanes and we got better side visions back along the road that there was to be no more action and i can give you a more update but i think we 'd have to go into uh confidential from that uh report that their solicitor give us why don 't they get them purchased but you know i thought the sight distances when we dealt with mr ray ross was achievable and there was no more accident on the road so i would have assumed that um the meeting whoever was in charge of meeting would have given that response to mr charge i mean if tim chad is just making a comment well i think it might have been before chris um chris was here i just thought if i recall that when we got the sight distance we 've got the banner mr ross yeah amenable to had to buy the ground like i said that part is confidential and yeah i i thought the exactly what council mccarthy is saying is correct we went out and had a look and uh because when we got the overtaking lane it opened it up and didn 't require that little pass or land i think what tim charge might have been referring to uh the traffic community meeting was grass had grown real high and it 's just minimized the side distance looking towards over and uh we mentioned that the engineer i think he was going to shine if the grass is cut back down this slight distance is fine it has been done okay it has been done thank you councilman just but just in relation to this i think it 's just confirmation that that matter is being dealt with with no longer the amendment now becomes emotional in paper information karen thank you thank you council dhoni page 44 item 1203 over on sports facilities committee the recommendation is that the minutes of the overall sports facilities committee held on the 11th of august please councillor gibbons and a second approach council of people thanks for giving us your wish respect for the report i 'm a bit vague on it and i was there i know but uh yeah the hoops are going up and i think it 's a true report of what was discussed at the moment excuse me council capable nothing really but interesting to note that um there are some uh some concerns raised and there are obviously a few questions about the new sports fields which i assumed were answered to make the raises of the concerns happen um my understanding is the concerns have been raised by the football club were provided to the assassin officer that 's dealing with the current league 's club application here and those will be taken in consideration as part of that report um just madame mayor i 'd just like to make a note that based on the attendance there wasn 't a column to allow me to go ahead i think it just should be noted that whilst there is a set of minutes the quorums required to create 's no call for this moment and i 'm just just through the minutes and i 've been reading the discussion around the sports club and can i just reiterate that the general manager blair and the general manager um have only been dealing with boards as far as funding is concerned they haven 't been dealing with the actual concept plan at all apart from the last meeting so the suggestions you know that that to me tells me that general manager and the mayor have been involved in heavy conversations that 's not the case it 's been the funding we 've been involved in and just of recent time the concept and the concept designs the extent of a jrpp approval correctly yes it 's still window so yeah so as the general manager said um these suggestions or some of these suggestions would have come in as submissions is that correct my understanding through the chair chairs my understanding is that they have been raised in a letter to council that 's been forwarded to the assessing officer that can to provide as a submission now shows that there 's an interest out there and the plan that they 've been submitted although it 's only a concert plan isn 't suitable but you 've got to go through the fleet complex to get to the netball courts so i don 't know whether they have to get changed when the concept plan can be changed or whatever whether that 's now or the whole thing will get a guernsey as it is but you can see here from cancer givens the budget would they like to call and discuss another meeting and that 's what they want to do they don 't they want to have more input into it before it becomes a plan i know you 'd keep saying it 's only a concept plan but one of the things that wasn 't taken in the things from our consultant was one of the submissions was that at the moment that people can sit in their car and watch the football with the plan provided to us whether it be a concert plan or not doesn 't allow that and most of the with our bad weather that needs to be taken into consideration that 's the comment thank you any other people um they 're just maybe a query i don 't know how important it is that these meetings do have usually a meeting is not a meeting without a quorum i think we 've got two or three councillors we reappointed to that committee tonight um and i think those councillors obviously have trouble getting to to those meetings should should we add another council or two to that so that at least we 've got a couple of councillors there um defer to the general manager i still there are three councillors on that committee at the moment i think in the country from wrong council line no i haven 't_''_9063.52 i haven 't had any minutes i haven 't had any invitations to come to the meetings but i know that i can remember because i normally decide straight away if i get an invitation to come to a meeting the next meeting will be on the 10th of november 2021. i 've got a written on my think we need to reassess um for three months can i just make a comment to chris to have a look at whether the councils have been invited to the meetings yeah through the chair yes certainly i will uh look into that but uh as far as i 'm aware the councils have been invited with some of our sorry what i mean with some of our committees and delegates they show up on your diary but for some they don 't it 's a bit all over the place so i don 't know if we can and this may be part of our new system um but i do note that you know some things appear on our diaries and some things don 't_''_9133.2 which might help maybe you can take that up yeah that 's what i 'm saying this one may not appear in the diary whereas the upper macquarie appears in our diaries and i think the borg timber one does appears in my diary sports complex yeah okay i don 't know i i said i didn 't know maybe you can take unless i accept an invitation and i accepted an invitation today and then all the minutes and all the information that i needed to look at which i 'd read half of it 's [Music] is there any other comment on this committee report i 'll put the recommendation all in favor what 's the decision page page 52 councillors item 1302 item 1302 sorry over on bicentennial tapestries project there 's a recommendation that council provide an additional 2 100 from community programs and events budget to supplement the works undertaken with repair and restoration framing of the oberon bicentennial tapestries and i have a mirror council callum and a secondary council online thank you councillor kellen do you wish to speak to this one uh thank you madame i think we have got exceptional value um and exceptional work from uh allison um when you read her report of the the conservative conservation of the tapestries and also the amount of work she put into it uh it 's quite extraordinary and i think she set us up to have a uh a series of artifacts which will the extra 2100 um is part of that 's the budget itself that needs to be topped up to 600 and i strongly endorse the added contribution for allison a lot of people in this town participated in took many hours two to two years put on work to complete the projects so be wonderful and um that they 're fully restored and around for possibly hundreds of years because it 's a reflection of what our community was and what we did here thank you council any other comments comments on this one councillors councilman and i think that eventually when these uh tapestries are hung in a new hub that they should be uh like um acknowledging the work that allison has put into these as part of that as recognition as part recognition there may be other ways but that should be a must i would suggest we have discussed that the other comments councils put the recommendation all in favor thank you okay 60 63 item 1303 business case land at 34 grinder avenue oberon the recommendation is that council provide 20 000 from the land for a dual occupancy on land known as lot 10 dp 245 689 being known as 34 windier avenue can i have a loader please cancel the car thing second to place how 's it going thank we need to go to the block of land and find out what footprints we 've got because the sewer lines traverse the thing and restrict the area and the council that i 've seen anyway i think the action to relocate the sewer needs to occur on the north side not the south but um yeah if we can 't get a decent footprint to develop this ground i think it 's going to stay as a part and i hate people in words but um yeah it 's encumbered by this sewer line and and i think that 's the first thing we need to do use some money then see what build we 've got whatever and it was disappointing for me that that young chap took that thing on and wasn 't showing that in his brief that we had that incumbent because that 's a part of learning good um plans from that young chap but it doesn 't fit on the block just through the chair that information was provided to that person as part of that development for what it was the second thing the 20 000 would look at developing projects if there is incumbents on that whether we have to go to some length to cover to peering side to move whatever that looks like that 's the that 's the intention of having this project put together counselor danny wants to talk to you yeah counselor i 'm happy to put 20 000 aside i um i think the um i think the project 's worth investigating um definitely uh 20 000 seems to be a fair bit straight up and down if councilman mckibben 's points are too valid but um no the scheme uh has my support madam mayor i think we should take a look thank you council joni um the only thing i i don 't know whether it 's necessary general manager advised i 'll be proposing an amendment to say the council provide up to twenty thousand it by saying you 're providing 20 000 it 's you know where is it we may do the the those council catholics we may do the investigation of the sewer for instance and say oh we can 't go any further it 's cost us five thousand dollars stop um through the chair the intention would be is if those encumbrances are unsurmountable yeah we wouldn 't be spending 20 000. so look i 'm not here or there but i just as long as it 's understood it 's up to if it needs to be clearer the only amendment obviously proposing was adding the words up to before 20 000. that 's real cheering yep add up and counselor telling no objection to that and 65 councillors 1304 land development curtis street over on there 's a recommendation in two parts that council provide twenty thousand dollars from the land bank to put their documentation to support a development application for a subdivision on land known as lot10 dp48069 and lot 9 section 33 dp750805 being known as 48 62 curtis street overall but council undertake the in the development application do i have a movement please council mccarthy and councillor paper thank you just sweet better put up there too and [Music] mccarthy do you wish to speak to this yes madame um as a part of the investigation i 'd like to see um whether curtis street and dylan street may be required to be a split level and that should be a part of the report to come back in other words there 's a large embankment to you know we don 't want to sell the people or lemon if we 're going to develop this but the part of the investigation into the ground whether that those roads should be split we have a block of ground there and i think it 's probably the right time to make some decisions about what we 're going to do with it and uh if we put up to twenty thousand dollars there to uh help us to decide what to do with it i think we 're worthwhile thank you councilman um thank you madame um i have i think there needs to point to at the base of page 65. the second one reads the depth disturbance should not be restricted to less than 800 millimeters i believe noting 0.4 and the point above and below that the depth disturbance should be restricted to less than 800 meters so the word not should be deleted so a pa council and take the appropriate presence as outlined as the support to be include the development application subject to an amendment to the recommendations or the point below to delete the word notch do we need an amendment to delete the word i 'm not sure i 'm not sure what the because because we are saying in two that council undertake the recommendations below so appropriate recommendation yes so one of them listed is two it should not have a knot in it so i don 't change that it becomes appropriate yes so that not needs to be deleted oh well okay um maybe you 're right i i read it to me that the depth disturbance should not be restricted to less than 800 millimeters i know it 's not a less than 800 milliliters and if it is if if um if you want to go more than 800 um okay management plan but then it says should be four said should work be required below 800 asbestos management will find the highlight i 'm just enjoying it madam there did you not put your hand upside down as as a as an ex-school teacher i feel i should be saying something to these gentlemen about their english and their spelling and all the other things but it 's it 's just withering viewing really no matter maybe i 'm good thank you any other comments [Music] um thing did didn 't_''_9871.76 we have um yeah aquarius just do a survey recently and found nothing through through the chair down to 800. so that was what the that 's what the recommendations we never put this coating on us when we 're doing a skate park or anything like that we threw it through the chair that 's exactly what we did because we know of a naturally occurring asbestos in the area every time we go anywhere near that too okay should we do that with the rejected final fence where we put the concrete fence up in curtis street my understanding is it didn 't go below 800. okay thank you thank you is there any other comment before i put the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 67 item 1305 proposed replacement of the causeway on noonan 's hill road there 's a recommendation in two parts houseboats that council agreed to the replacement of the causeway on noon and zoo road with a concrete structure utilizing two precast concrete box cells with the concrete concrete overlay surface two the pro that project funding of 80 000 for the replacement causeway be made using funds from the 2021-22 road maintenance budget can i have a mover please council mccarthy council mcgivern thank you nelson mccarthy do you wish to speak to this one madam mayor if we 're going to do a major amount of work and this will lift the road base across that cross and up a bit which is good but somewhere i read with a lot of hyper focus about um pipes on these crossings i used to work with two blades that put set lines on each end of the pipe and each afternoon they used to come around with fish so fish definitely spit in them so if any fishermen tries to tell you that they 've got our box culverts instead of fights they 'll lay the hog wash and i think brenda long 's right over the same gentleman thank you guys um i do have some sympathy for council mccarthy to you because i have actually seen fish go through pipes but um i look i think the uh the recommendations uh at aptly suitable and uh i 'm very happy to say that necessary thank you very much 21st century and i 'll agree with clyde that fish will go up round tight but you tell the fisheries that because they 'll find you and find you very hard if you don 't use bob 's compass to square college yeah over to you and uh good work thank you council any other comments counselors seem to recall that this across and was washed away one of their counselors actually got an award for dragging someone out of the car i thought the concrete was shown in the paper being tipped up you know i thank you page 71 item 1306 review of payment of security finance policy 2104 the recommendation is that council endorse the updated payment of sick police policy 2104 as presented can i have a movable as a cable and the second of these i think this is an interesting policy and an excellent policy and i um i think i think it 's an excellent excellent policy and excellently presented thank you councilwork yes i read it i understood the reasoning for it um and i i believe that it probably should extend his counsel i 'm mad at me i 'm happy with the policy review i would ask probably at a later date review some of the wording in the there 's a paragraph underneath the type decorative if we 're paying a bonus which encourages our staff to attend work 1307 policy review triple 1 3 enterprise risk management policy there 's a recommendation in three parts placed on public exhibition for a period of 28 days but at the exp at the expiration of the exhibition period should no submissions be received revised policy triple one three enterprise risk management be adopted as presented three but at the expiration of the exhibition period should submissions be received an updated report will be presented to council can i have a mover please council trump councilman thank you councillor kellum do you wish to speak to this uh just um i think we 've counseled and i did a bit of um crack change but we end up with is um i think both council tom and i did put a few embedded comments in um so i think a couple of actions i mean i think on page if i could 79 i put a comment on the side i 'm not sure if this is correctly worded what i think that means is that if the general manager is happy you can either reword that or take it out because the next sentence probably deals with it so subject to so maybe we just need to on public exhibition um i noticed council keller made a couple of comments um they may have been he may have deleted those already in response to the embedded comments on there on page 80 etc i um the one on page 79 probably just needs to be looked at in in connection with the next sentence i included as to whether it actually is needed in line with that i think it 's then that 'll be suitable to go on exhibition and once maybe the markup so take it out et cetera and it just needs to read through any other comments on this one putting the recommendations into page 86 counselor reports for information item 1401 monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please um on the difficulties and the the way i have to get the new get our new chief financial thank you thanks mark um we have gone out again for a second of advertising for the surface position we currently have it um supplemented through a very competent cfo we 're looking for a person who can meet the requirements of council moving forward so we 're re-advertising that position as we speak thank you thanks man i 'm missing something here so we 've had the last chief financial advisor resigned yes when was that um july okay all right probably made aware of that but i wasn 't_''_10441.12 i couldn 't figure it okay so that person only been the job a short period of time i believe that 's correct right this seems to be a never-ending battle this position um through the chair currently these types of positions are a uh has been since 2016 i think um well i think that 's that 's the only area i identified also for questioning i 'm i 'm quite happy to uh to second that this report i counsel down his second laptop [Music] no he didn 't second the current restrictions are from sunday to 12th september 2021 masks are now required in all indoor areas and not your primary residence but in good news week it said outside you don 't have to wear need to wear a mask inside that 's right yeah you don 't need to wear a mask outside yeah um is could should that be included in this report you don 't have to wear it after in this through the chair all i 've said is that you need to wear a mask thank you johnny thanks thanks madam may um i think it 's quite an impressive report my compliments to the author or authors i think it 's pretty solid um just a couple of quick points um uh nice to see that bit of innovation or or passing on from the library with this um idea of actually delivering books to people 's homes i think that 's a that 's a great little one i note going to page 90 on the issue of training that that currently being undertaken is a certificate for in business studies um where is that being undertaken physically yes it 's online counselor that 's online okay all right there was um in recent times the conversation of trying to get a couple of other training modules uh for that to be pursued i 'm through the the chair i believe that you 're talking about that tried to implement the tafe yes that 's correct and had a pretty much a change in direction since that time but it 's certainly something that we can we can try and reach out to them again to see where this position is at the moment i just i raise it out of interest because uh any training that we can get sourced out of over on that reduces the inconvenience and cost for any of our staff to do it is is a real bonus so i just raise it um under recruitment on page 91 i 've been following the package of the chief financial officer i think i raised it last time we mentioned this and it 's not a bad package at the moment so there must be [Music] are they getting paid a lot more than that somewhere else in a word yes it must be yeah because um you know in the most recent um offer i thought that was um generous package um of september water new south wales and oberon council joint discussion fish river water quality could you just provide a little bit more detail on that if that 's at all possible through the chair i was just looking at options around what that looks like moving forward as i indicated to councillors previously that um there had been some discussion around bypass determination about water quality and how that would look in the purchase stakes so it 's just a add-on to that okay thank you very much thanks man i 'll put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 97 monthly activity report planning and development recommendations there that report item 1402 has received his information councilor kievan thank you a second to place that 's my cable thank you councilman mcgivern do you wish to speak through i do thank you madam um a detailed report just a couple of quick a couple of questions halfway down page um nine seven um the survey has obviously been undertaken of um existing levels of the weight facility have we got the results of that yet through you through the chair no no we haven 't received the results yet counsellor um but i 'll we 'll be chasing it up this week in the next paragraph i could have we start or commence the work on the office amenities and is it anticipated that we 're looking at providing power to the site as well i assume through the chair there was a meeting on site this morning to commence the proceedings which will most likely occur next monday power in the short term will be via a generator as we 're looking at the mains power to come to the tip for the long term okay i thought we were looking at solar power at one stage but that 's not viable i think through the chair not not viable considering the uh the the that we 're looking at the uh the mains to come from uh to the uh waste depot okay and if i could madame if we go down to the bottom of page 97 um has the pro timeline for the omron swing call complex amenities upgrade uh now been uh the end of september or was that going to be provided at the october meeting uh through the chair the the project is uh anticipated to be completed by the end of next week with the um the pool to be opened um in early october the actual project will be completed not the project timeline the actual project will be sorry through the chair the actual project will be completed sorry yes all right thank you uh that 's all i have i 'm very happy to make the recommendation for this uh this overview approved by council thank you nothing for you any other comments counsellors council mccartney um checking on the progress of the um office due to the report that it should be underway i 'd be assured that we are managing this project ourselves and haven 't got central west project management team in to do this job when we should be able to do this small project in-house through the chair it is being um managed in-house counsellor um uh central west project manager have just been assisting with some initial um initial quotations fee to his service or is he doing it there was an initial minor fee for some um for some um engaging some drawings etc okay thank you young comments counsellors for direct putting the recommendation all in further thank you page 101 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is the report item is received as information can i have someone to move that please counseling and the secondary council mccarthy thank you councilman do you wish to speak to this um thank you madam mayor and i underst i understand that technical services had a very busy time of late with damage that 's been caused to roads by snow and other events um and the number of trees that have been over obviously the state of some of our roads um has deteriorated uh massively with what has occurred um and i know the work and there has been some deferral of capital works capital works uh related to grants until better weather has been is forthcoming just on that i would like just like to know i did raise uh with the director of technical realizing that maybe there may be some delay in work being undertaken on schumacher 's road and i didn 't have a time to look at ball ridge road i know there has been some graveling on schumacher 's road but there are or are or were sorry some areas that were very bad and i did suggest some signs to be put in place until um until works have been undertaken i 'm just asking the signage should now be erected on those roads that was the instruction that i have provided for staff to review those roads given the information of this repair that 's particularly shoemaker 's road the graveling and the like is being pursued with a potential gravel source through forestry corporation we 're in the process now of talking with gravel crushing companies in order to be able to facilitate that gravel for such work and as soon as uh some resource you can then commit with uh machinery and alike so again yeah uh we have been delayed with regard to weather and uh and some of those events that you have outlined to um move with this recommendation that this report be accepted by the meeting that occurred councilman comes from cartier adame pretty good report i know he 's got lot of work on um a matter of getting this work done has made it being organised but um i put in a council request form and i couldn 't understand and i still can 't understand to this day why pipes weren 't installed on mozart road um in the one kilometer section that we were heading in seal and apparently now we 're doing the two kilometers so yeah it to me it doesn 't wash chris anyway i know you can 't_''_11188.8 be everywhere but we have other staff that are just as accountable as yourself and is there any project progress i take it to be under your control on the toilet block in apex park we 're going to actually clean one up and then do the next one or is that only your controller or is that back to the director um yeah through through the bear um you look the second item there apex it was off council 's view to uh facilitate some amenity upgrades in there but that hasn 't uh that hasn 't proceeded just as yet uh with regard to the first item that you raised mozart road and the pipes uh yet certainly do agree that there was a need for pipe covers to be installed at certain locations on that road and as mentioned to council there was an additional one of work in this current financial year uh and some of that work was certainly delayed until such time that we we proceed with that that work this year and with the view then of providing bitumen uh bitumen seal at the end of that uh that that installation which then will conclude the two kilometres of work on mozart road that doesn 't install in the pipes of the construction stage give you a thing that you don 't bump into it or and gives the pipes settled time to settle like you 've only got to take out here on the duckweed road as you come around near deep creek that 's a terrible example it was long before your time but you you see rms and all them people one of the things the first they do is lay the pipes out that 's all through the man certainly is a couple of ways it can be done and that is one certainly um approach uh i think as long as when the pipes are laid uh adequately adequate compaction is achieved is the uh i think the ultimate aim there in terms of then not having any subsidence in your in your road surface at the end of the day so it will be done um i can confirm that thank you [Music] just want to compliment the yeah the work that 's been done through madame works being done through the parks and gardens the tree pruning has definitely made the street trees look much better we 've had many compliments how nice the main street looks at this time of the year um it 's been yeah i just want to compliment the staff they 've done a good job the apex path maintenance of that 's looking very great it picnic there i 'm just a big compliment to the staff because they 're doing a good job thank you council how 's the capital there oh yeah often another pat on the back or two here too um the effort put in by the outdoor people during the the snow event and the aftermath of that i think was was fantastic the the mess along the roads um out our way and probably everywhere else we couldn 't go anywhere to see anywhere else but um it was an awful mess abercrombie road you couldn 't walk along and some of the smaller roads were were even worse than the effort that 's been put in to tidy that up and including the contractors who were doing the um the cleaning up along the road sites now doing the mulching and cleaning up of all that they 're all doing a great job and i think it should be recognized and i think the other thing that 's worthy of recognition is um down two thirds of the way down page 103 where uh traffic from new south wales level r2 that 's going to make it a difference to the jobs that they can can undertake and i think that 's that 's terrific and and congratulations to the people who um work towards that and uh that 's going to be something that 's valuable to uh to this council thank you another comment from this one counselling with the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 105 councillors 1404 monthly activity report corporate services the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have another please i have to answer tell them can i have a secondary [Music] on the cyber security training when might that happen uh through the chair that 's that 's ongoing at the moment we 've rolled that out so um i believe 64 36 of the staff have completed that that training already thank you thank you thank you madame um just in relation from page 105 to the open cities project team kickoff um noting that we 're using a project the project management tool asana do we have a a timeline for each of counselor we uh in the first phase of scoping that detailed discovery in governance timeline but essentially this project in entirety is looking about four to six months um from phase one right through to to launch full site launch so we 're just in the starting to really um embark on that discovery governance element at the moment okay i think if you could just keep us appraised on a monthly basis of how we 're going against each of those five and if we 're if we 're looking at a six months time frame where we are at each meeting so we know the progress thank you madame i 'm happy to send this okay council mccarthy um count uh lynette safrane was in this position um she said she would ensure the um checking of the cameras before the weekend is that being taken over by someone checking the just a quick shout out for the over on youth council they are trying to raise some money and the world seems to be against them at the moment they they can 't get out from the so if uh if they do venture out uh i encourage everybody to be generous i forgot to bring my tickets tonight but uh i 'll take your money and write them out when i get home any other comments counselors 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is that council receive report item 1405 as information can i have a mover please can i move it please castle mccarthy council kellum thank you mr speaker pretty good detail report um waiting on the interested star wouldn 't it it 's going to change it 's quicker than what you think how 's it coming normal report by any of these i failed to understand what that 's trying to tell us [Music] investment place sorry councilman oh just just commented on coach 1130 we 're not getting any interest on the money we invested oh okay we invested in august it 's good to see that the federal government has policy looks like somewhere over in china isn 't it 300 billion uh things collapsed over there yeah i think that might be irresponsible the other comments from this report update the recommendation is that the report is received with information a mover please counsel on the convention council okay listen you wish to speak position i do thank you mr man um informally before i just have a few questions um the um the date for submitting grant applications under the black summer bushfire recovery grants after we did all those work that worked in those meetings to make sure we 've made it in time and been however it 's always better to be ahead of the ahead of the timeline um on b the amount that we 're getting under local roads community infrastructure phase through madame general manager can remind me that 1 million 169 08 dollars um we i know we 're still waiting for the guidelines have they been issued today through the chair now they haven 't uh because i think we were going to look at those we 're going to look and see whether our road our one-court race recovery because that 's got another uh our roads that requiring and i can 't remember how environmentally affected our environmentally effective 're hoping it would for my recollection is that correct drew the chair will be bringing a report back to the works committee to give council more open when do we have to submit it my understanding is it can be submitted at any time however upon endorsement it needs to be used with also within a specific time so we can 't use it until after january right and it has to be expended prior to i think december the following yeah it says from first of january we have to we we have the access to funds but in order to access access to funds we also need the guidelines to make sure it 's a catch-22 um and if i could but i 'm on page 116 greater cities and regional sports facility fund um this um the guidelines um it 's open on the 31st and closes 8th of august sorry 8th of october so we have to we 're going to have to make some quick decisions on that because we won 't have another meeting before that through the chair there are a number looking to utilize in this fund so this current sports complex that we 've already got 4.8 million plus blah blah would be eligible um through the chip potentially yes so without a meeting before the 8th of october how are we going to make a determination as to which ones this council would become so through the chair council 's already endorsed a number of projects within the matrix and we were looking to put those endorsed projects into this okay so there 's no priority no priorities no right there 's no need for priorities okay so we put them all in and see what they accept through the chair that 's how we look at that okay i all right um thank you madame i 'm very happy to uh propose this recommendation accepted in this report south by council thank you councilman castle cable uh nothing further thank you just again uh over and over dog park i think we 've made it down there i 'm just wondering why we couldn 't make a bit of a move on it until we get some funding 's an open area like this was up in maitland uh it 's there and sort of ready to go without offense these other ones i see haven 't_''_12019.52 they 're not cast in one 's on uh [Music] [Music] through the chair council 's resolution was to undertake this project subject to grant funding council has now applied for the grant it 's received support my understanding from from from the powers that be we are purely just waiting for that funding to be announced so that 's for 12 months time um i hope not i think they are looking to have make those decisions in october so we shouldn 't be too far away i can walk you before christmas thank you any other comments on this one counsellors i 'm putting the recommendation all these over very thank you page 117 1407 water and sewer plant record the recommendation is that the report is received as information remove the police counsellors because the people and that 's the government council of people you should speak to this report um just very briefly it 's a lot ago isn 't it so that 's um the dam 's gone up nearly uh 20 in in the month so it 's it 's 85.4 today [Music] counselors the recommendation all in favor mary thank you page 120 item 1408 monthly updates status of council resolutions the recommendation is that report item is received as information the mover fee in relation to this um i just wanted information to page 123 resolution that 's going forward do we have any update um as there was a delay in the being um carry out some of this work due to covert 19 is that being overcome or they 're still necessary for obviously weber and others to attend site so through the chair there still will be a requirement for webers to attend the site however what they are doing at this point in time is using a lot of um off-site programs and technology in order to give an understand or an overview on what the what the facility could look like i was involved in a meeting together with the corporate acting corporate services director this week in what the site could look like both both matt and myself asked for opportunities around when that technolo when that modeling has been completed because it was tweaks twigs that are required um that a like a fly over the side or a fly through of the site being provided so as we could use that to give our community an understanding what it 's engaged that the hub will look like and once again generate the comment on the back of that on the back of that so that application is still progressing in lieu of the code situation are we saying that that stage of the project cannot be finalized though until they actually have some real-time presence in obama to finish it through the chair i would find it difficult that they could complete it without physically that 's what i 'm asking so we 're dependent on some relaxation of the sydney covert restrictions in order for them to complain is that correct through the chair bring on 70 percent you 're answering the question um and if i could uh through the amount of amount know one and four or finalized but two three and five is the project management facility operation policy being uh finalized now conjunction with the committee has the lease of contracting arrangements been updated [Music] and well obviously the first thing would have been the reason the independent living needs committee in the terms of reference committee which of those have been completed the acting acting corporate services director did you hear that through the chair sorry council could you repeat that question please certainly so page 125 11 200 oh it 's actually impact starts on page 124 11 200 721 to the independent living units review um there 's a there 's a whole series of um of um actions there one to five one to four have been finalized it 's been noted have the independent living units committee um reaffirmed the i think that 's reaffirmed the appointees to that committee and have we developed the terms of reference to that committee that 's the first question the next one is well maybe we answer that one first through the check answer that one is ongoing _''_12401.76 point have we undertaken a further review of the lease and contracting arrangements and prepares the standardised current lease documents for the tenants uh through the chair we have received an array of legal advice on that with a draft leased lease document which we are currently refining and looking to start implementing we are just making some uh review on uh where that stands so but we do have uh received those draft documentation from the legal review um and internally have we developed a project management facility operation policy for those independent living units uh through the chief counsellor that 's in draft at the moment okay thank you um and i think that were i think that was all the issues i had made general manager said page 130 the rural road environmentally effective is going to be considered at the first medium um street master player is that um progressing i know it 's the um that the meeting was it wasn 't cancelled and uh is there another one you will do um through the chair bring on 70 yeah there 's people coming from the orange planet so that 's all page 131 councillors 1409 over on weight stafford the recommendation if the report item is received for information please and i 'm giving in a second to please does the problem thank you please speak to um i 'm very pleased to see that we have the action short-term medium the long-term with some indicative uh costings noting that for the short-term actions um overall the pricing is not significant i haven 't added them all up so i 'm i 'm sure the director of planning can advise us what the total is um if we are to bring in i couldn 't um i think the low loader that we talked about sorry tell a handler thrown in the loader that we talked about i can 't missed it somewhere um if we were to add that into our short term costings uh we 're able to know what sort of money we have to put aside and whether that 's already coded for within the um waste facility funding i think i could ask that question would this come with ordinary meeting through the director thank you madam through the chair that 's correct it will come through with the further update in october um once we get some negative costings on um on the proposal that was adopted earlier on in the meeting today tonight plus uh some further costings okay fine um through the chair what we 'll also do is provide a timetable as to the term timetable versus a medium and long term timetable okay that 's fine so we know so we know short term is going to be a year or whether it 's six or whether it 's eight okay that 'd be good thank you for the chair that 's that 's the intention of the october report and i also have to fit in with what we think appropriate for allocating through the chair that 's correct um if i could also have we had any submissions from the public or others in relation to the jsrs report or if they 've been favorable or not through the chair there was one submission received and that was very favorable for the um i think if that 's the one i 'm thinking of it also was from a commercial operator who 's had some issues relating to the hours of service i think was one of the issues because being a commercial service they had problems with the closed down and i think there was also an issue about garbage runs i think not right not following council boundaries so the issue was because they if you don 't have a garbage service following a council boundary there would be some council runs may pick up some in bathurst then owned up and over and some starting oberon and end up in bathurst so it 's where they end up with the facilities they use i think was discussed so is there anything we got able to do in relation to the hours but you know i think they talked about accredited you know commercial operators who you know are responsible i think that was the main one of the major issues i think they were well i don 't know but you said i think they were complimentary probably of hours of operation for our current landfill is something that needs to be considered by council at some time in the future um if nothing more than to look at the the length of time that people are on site being staff right so council as part of this review will absolutely be looking at what are the actions that can put in place but also the efficiencies that we can implement into this process to in fact uh reduce some of the costs that we have um honest at this point in time given that given the um uh the scattered hours of opening that we have during the week and those of the weekend so look there 's a whole part of the review that the director has undertaken so it 's noted and it will come back as part of ongoing i don 't know if we 've consulted with other commercial operators but i 'm assuming they all have a similar thing um i think the issue probably is we 've got to be you know if they 're responsible operators well it 's up to resolved to look at the hours of operations for the tip all those things would need to be considered as part of our consultation okay um that 's all i have um as i said i 'm i 'm very happy that we 've actually done this work on on putting our short medium and long term and we 're starting to do the costings on it and the report comes back in october thank you i 'm very happy to recommend this before councilman i agree with councilman kevin it 's pleasing to see the work get started on on programming all this remedial activity the covering of the probably the biggest short-term issue we 've got and uh i think one of the issues with uh forcing the field to do that is actually probably gonna be a bigger problem um one of the things that i know reports coming back but um when we started recycling on the um over the dump point we extended the time until 11 o 'clock it used to be from april 10 at the tip and now we 've got that in that uh building and that person i i have the report comes back and can be utilized more often than just sitting in 11 there is no activity through the chair we 're in fact now at the point where we 're seeking some data around uc gym and going down that path now in order to get us some data around that all right thank you and just the other thing is um part of the thing was identified all those old tree roots and things like that i i can 't understand with our trucks heading out to um somewhere like fake spin well they can 't_''_12986.319 be loaded in the truck and taken out there and burnt or we 've burned with the forestry you can see them they 've just re-burned on here and the meadow 's road surely goodness we can burn that rather than have it chewed up with the mulch or something like that probably the food with the mulching wouldn 't want it through their machine but there 's large a lot of activity that we can be doing now we thanks madam mayor um i too am very pleased to see this project continuing you know our tip uh um requires a great deal of work and i 'm looking forward to it beginning to um to really show the returns just on 134 uh second call second row down um i i don 't i can 't remember whether it was my comment put that in there or it came from somewhere else but you know i have been to establishments where there is a position a particular position um where folk actually um you know go around picking up litter in the tip uh it it cannot work in isolation it must have um major um all the major work going right before it it you know just fine tunes the actual level of litter around a tip but i 'm just wondering have have we got any concrete plans for that position or for carrying out that function through you to the director or the chair um no no concrete plans at this stage counselor but something to be uh considered and reviewed as part of the you know uh better covering and um um you know tackling some of the bigger sources then then that 'll make a real difference but i 'll be interested to see how we solve that one thank you madame recommendation all in favor aye thank you page 141

no declarations thank you we do have a presentation this evening a presentation will be provided by chris milne from central west project management in relation to the oberon community hub welcome chris i can see your name there but i can 't see you coming thank you madam yep thank you thanks sharon um good evening all you have for me to start yes thank you chris thank you um something just go to the next slide please i 'd like to take the opportunity to give council an update on the activities at the community hub um also talk to a couple of specific design issues that we 'd like to get some direction on as we go through so weber the architects who initially did the drafting for council have been re-engaged to complete this stage of the project we 've engaged edge consulting engineers for all of the engineering services we 've taken some time to review the existing conditions within the buildings we 've confirmed that there is actually a 770 millimeter variance between the floor levels of the library and the bob hooper center also undertaken geotech and survey asbestos inspections and coping certainly having an impact on the progress of the works we have been maintaining the energy though and facilitating um some of the designers accessing the building via walk around facebook links and zoom links where we 've been showing the design review was to review the brief and ensure compliance resolve how we were going to deal with those change of levels we looked at whether we did need those two individual officers and what their purpose was we 've had discussions would live better um and believe and they 've confirmed that they 're able to work within the co-working space in the workstation area rather than having their own offices excuse me we 've specifically looked at the dda access or disability discrimination act access to the workstation area to ensure that it 's compliant for disabled people looked at roof considerations cost effectiveness design and identified with the engineering department the existence of a drainage easement across the road across the side of vicar pardon and working with chris and his team on how to resolve that issue thanks so for consideration tonight and what we 'd like council to look towards is um our recommendations which are generally consistent with the design intent of option 1a that came from the council meeting in december but specifically that we would maintain the robert hooper building which 1950s building and i 'm sorry but i 'm calling it that because it sort of gives it a reasonable description and that 's the the building um that is between the library and the bob hooper building provide shared space for live better transport rather than individual offices separate the roof forms to articulate the spaces that 's really between the robert hooper building and the main library building we 've undertaken a functional space review and continue to do so with matthew webb and the light the new library manager and to proceed to develop the pprs and the tender documents to take the project too tender thanks sharon a quick review this is option 1a which was from the december meeting the approved option really the specific thing i wanted to point out here is um in the middle of there um is a um is a ramp um between the amenities and some of the other spaces and that ramp doesn 't comply with the disabled code access requirements it 's too steep based on the change in elevation so that 's been one of the and as we go forward i think generally would say that the area to the left of the main through corridor we haven 't really looked to change at all it 's really this access into the robert hooper center and how we arrange those rooms adjacent to the in that ramp and amenities area um and that 's that 's probably all if you 've had an opportunity to look at the the presentation you 'll understand some of those other points if we can just go to the next one we 've actually looked at three options in how oh sorry throughout this design process we 've looked back into the design brief that was in the business case that we was approved at the end of last year and come back to check and test the requirements of the the brief to ensure that the design that we 're putting together is still satisfying those brief requirements and um responding to the the the um the approved scheme some of the key issues that highlighted in in what we 've been looking at in these couple of uh quantity to be determined and um we 're questioning that given that um an enclosed office is generally gets owned by somebody it then gets used part of the time rather than being open to the community open to the people using particularly that workspace that of course doesn 't deal with offices or space for the staff of the library we need to maintain a high level of security to external doors anecdotal evidence is there 's a lot of keys floating around to the the um the robert hooper area uh doors get left open and so on so that 's something that we 've focused on security access through both reception and during working hours and also after hours so specifically we 've looked at how we can provide after hours access to the building and the the functional use of that separation of noise sources whether that 's the the office areas or the library itself but we 've looked at that and access to meeting rooms thanks so of the three options we 've really looked and we 've i 've highlighted on these you 'll see a lot of the other spaces remains just that particular option provides a ramp system that does comply with the disabled codes you can see that it 's quite a lengthy ramp there 's a landing in the middle and it breaks the the building in half it also increases the actual circulation space that takes away either increases the size of the building or takes away from the functional space within the building that comes along arrives at a lamp a ramp and then comes up into the robert hooper space and there 's a set of doors at the top of that ramp um thank you this is our section option second option actually provides a set of steps and what 's um just adjacent to those set of steps is a small chair lift it rises up that 770 millimeters they 're often used in domestic environments and so forth it 's a small electrical lift and it would provide that dda access some of the issues around that lift though is it 's a mechanical system so it 's going to need to area and fiddling with it and breaking down and so on there are some issues around that that need to be considered sorry just excuse me for just going to go on mute for just one minute excuse me the um the option here removes the 1950 section of the building as did option four it introduces the stair and the disabled lift we 've rationalized the working space up in the workstation area with a toilet and a small meeting room and a kitchenette down one side this is this option maintains the connection between the spacers it is dda compliant um it allows us to rationalize the roof as does option four excuse me um and uh actually gives us increased size in our meeting room spaces not an increased number but increased size and we believe it gives a very functional use of the space we go into option six the difference between option five and option six is that we 've removed that stair and that small lift and the access to the robert hooper space is only via an external access and that again is that people who are able-bodied and people who are disabled have have the same access to that space what this does though it actually separates that workstation space in the old in the robert hooper area from the main body of the library and that 's the fundamental difference again it takes the 1950s building out of play and the reasoning behind that is really that that building is going to cause our investigations identified asbestos in the building um we also are confident that it will cause us problems in maintaining that building with footings and underpinning and so forth um if we can just move on there for a minute please sorry i 'm sort of moving through this reasonably quickly so the four lines there option 1a is the approved design and that 's coming up at 800 so those are a bit small we 've we 've discounted that because it doesn 't comply with the dda requirements we 've then looked at option four and we can see that option six actually gives us the maximum amount of functional area option five is slightly less ramp is about four or five four percent less functional area um to that end our recommendation is is option six or option five if we want to maintain the access between the buildings thanks there is a cost comparison um the the thing about each of these designs is we 're assuming that the building is going to come in at budget there 's still a lot of investigation and ultimately until we go to 10 that we 're not going to be resolved in actually the cost but what we 've tried to show here is that um option six arguably is the cheapest option we then add on the cost of that little hoist and the stairs and so on and then in option four we 're just building a bigger building so there is a larger impact on the cost it 's we 're actually going through the exercise of having a quantity surveyor look at the costing again now the original budget was put together on a square meter rate what we 've done is what we will do is actually break it down into a far more accurate expectation on costs and then we start to look at how we deliver the project within the budget that we 've got as i 've always said we 'll have to cut our cloth to suit the budget um but this and and really we are looking at this from a functional point of view thanks sure an update on the project timetable as i said covet is impacting on us we are we have been pushed back about a month or two but we are still progressing the job and based on access from people from sydney and so on um we 're just pushing ahead as as best we can i think what 's important in this and with the lead up to the elections now in december we 're looking to get this out to tender prior to and back and a recommendation to council prior to the um the closed down period of the elections to allow us to actually um bring you a decision or recommendation on the tenderer at that stage which then will allow us to move on into the first thing is yes we 're proposing to maintain the robert hooper building but different to the option 1a we are proposing to demolish the 1950s building that 's cost driven and also just an understanding that excuse me it actually breaks down the ability to give a functional space because of the change in levels provide a shared space for live better transport rather in within the business hub rather than separate offices what by separating the forms of the robert hooper building and the rest of the library and the resolution on the roof is not available at the moment and this fundamental design decision allows us to then go back and start to resolve that we can actually articulate the spaces so whilst they 're going to sit right beside each other we 're really keen that the library building has a very unique look to it it stands alone and it doesn 't look as though it 's just tacked on to the end of the robert hooper building and its existing reading spaces at the moment we 'll continue to review those functional spaces move around a little bit but within the context of the overall design it will be maintained and as i said we 're proceeding with the pprs and the tender documentation on the basis of the outcome of tonight 's meeting and we ask that i now upon our recommendation that we endorse option six as the preferred direction um is where we 'd like to go but ultimately that 's up to council and the option five or six i would suggest are the the two to be considered thanks sharon thank you thank you chris happy to take some questions by all means thank you [Music] um thank you madam mayor um i i know you 're just if i could i 'm just wondering how council staff feel about having the workstation area separate from the remainder of the building i accessed by separate doors that area um that 's my first question and that 's probably more to the staff than to you um also um and i know that that 's caused by the 770 millimeter variation in the um in the levels of the buildings to some degree um which are not which won 't be categorized by the same roof lines because the hoop will be in a different different location obviously where the work starts stations are and i assume there 's no other solution if we did want those two to be connected other than option five and option four is that is is that it um the they 're the two options that we 've we 've looked to yeah i think that 's a fair statement um councilman mckibben yeah it is i i 'm sorry i missed a fair chunk of the the second question but i think it was about the two distinct buildings i did i was wondering um for admit administration and for also um obviously i 'm looking also at staff costs for ensuring that we we can obviously um keep supervision of all the workspaces what a staff the council staffs view in relation to having that workstation area separate because it may need would it need a separate staff member to be able to supervise that area um i think perhaps i in the initial stages would be that because of the dislocation of that space within option four a or option six oh sorry action one a or option six um then we would be proposing that there is a cctv system installed within the building to monitor that space because it 's not practical to have a staff member up there monitoring it um also that it would be secured and people regain access people would actually come to the reception desk and obtain a electric swap electronic swipe card to actually gain access to it so it 's not an open door policy in that space um we have had those discussions with the library but again i 'll refer to matthew in a minute and also on the um the cctv actually put monitoring in place with some recording uh capacity so the diffusions were to take place we would be able to actually go back and and review that but um i don 't think we 're not certainly not intending that it would involve a staff member being up there full time by any means matthew in regards to i guess discussions with the staff i think when looking at all design options uh they all require an element of cctv to monitoring that that workstation space just based on the line of sight and operational um so there 's not a huge in regards to the library manager uh her video it 's not a huge difference in the operational side of that they would require that cctv monitoring another thing i i guess just feedback on the ground would be in terms of that functional space while um while that we all do understand that the option four does um um more space in terms of some functionality those types of features can also be used for um displaying art and things like that so those else those are that l-shape ramp um some of the feedback was from the staff that other libraries do use those interesting features so while it could be looked at in some respects as a as a negative in a functional way they can also be a positive um for those these cultural types of buildings so they staff thank you matthew is that all councilman kevin um so madam mayor from a staff perspective and bearing in mind the last comment um that matthew made um [Music] is there a preference from those who are administering the library in this area for option four over option six in that they feel that that although there is some dead functional space as a result of this large ramp the space could be used and the building may be more overall serviceable if option 4 was chosen thank you in regards to that question um i i think all designs work well for staff um i think there 's definitely some pros and cons of each i think one of the while an interconnecting feature from an operational point does provide some slight benefits the the biggest element i think for staff is how we use some of the internal space in terms of meeting rooms that can be used for multiple purposes i guess minimizing some of those internal dead space in terms of meeting rooms so in in regards to staff i think all three work quite there 's a definite preference from staff if that 's um if that 's acceptable thank you anything else councilman kevin before i go on to counselors in the room that 's fine no matter man thank you questions from the branch no pastor dhoni well thank you very much um i did previously investigate the idea with you chris that if there was a desire to create individual workstations in the robert hooper center that would be a possibility if we found that open plan did not work as well um can you just confirm that i can confirm that yep there 's there would be nothing stopping that there would be some need for some fit out but um it certainly wouldn 't be um it would be very achievable and i i i i take responsibility for the decision and deferring to the architect 's design i i am uncomfortable that there 's not an opening between the two buildings and that 's difficult made difficult to actually you know or possibly as you would say impossible to retrofit and meet requirements because there 's um there so i defer to the professionals of um saying this is the best we can do with what we 've got and it will get my support but that that is my background worry so thanks very much thank you uh thank you chris the issue that arose about box gutters and roof lines i that this new option uh four or five or six uh will negate that possibility there 's still work to be done on resolving the roof but that is that is the expectation and that 's the indicator that the designers have given us at the moment um because of that 770 mil gap the the eaves gutter that we would see on the robert hooper building would sit above the roof of the new library space and so we should be able to eliminate all box gutters and that 's that 's yet to be fully resolved but yes that is the case thank you thank you any other questions chris no thank you chris thanks melania good evening always a pleasure thanks very much everyone bye bye now bye-bye go home with the questions from the public there are no questions from the public this evening might have made a confirmation of the minutes the recommendation is that the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on the 20th of july 21 be confirmed could i have a mover please announcer capel and secondary councillor dhoni thank you any business arising recommendation all in favour harry thank you i now move to bring item 1305 forward if i could find a secondary place council mccarthy thank you all in favour very unanimously thank you now move on this would be for the benefit um the recommendation is that council endorse a design concept for the hub development to progress the report and i have someone to move that place thank you okay do you wish to speak to this council paper oh man you do you want us we need to put a recommendation up so we will need to and then the current recommendation that allows us to speak on this map so can i go ahead and um say that we endorse option six so you can 't move and that you there somebody who would be willing to move from pastor kelly and councillor councillor cameron your amendment uh my member would be that uh council endorse option six before the community development have a second council um as described by mr milne i think it 's for requirements i agree there are some disadvantages of having a separate building but i think that that provides greater functionality for the area that will be used and of course the separate building is a business card which is not associated functionally with the library so i think i think having it slightly separate is not a new uh price to pay i think we 'll end up with a much better product that 's my counselor it 's not perfect but i think it 's the best we 've got within our names and so it has my support thank you any other comments on this one council is councillor mccarthy through you madam mayor i think the separate meeting room has a benefit it 's separate you can go there and if you 've got a meeting of say 50 people can go in the library where it 's going to have more access i think it 's a good fit any other comments i will i will comment um and i note that through our consultation period that the community preference was not to demolish the robert hupper centre and keep the project in budget they were the two guidelines we were given i have no issue with a separated facility and it could be productive into the future i know that the the university is thinking about working at a hobbins hub-and-spoke model for people to take into courses remotely and this would be a perfect space to do that and it could be a perfect space for business people wanting to use the facility at odd hours if it 's a separate facility so i too support that recommendation i 'm going to put the recommendation counselors all in favor how did you know misty thank you [Music] i go back to page eight oh i 'm sorry i 'll now put the amendment counsellors all in favour the most the amendment now becomes the motion all in that the report item is received as information can i have someone to move that please counselor mckinney thank you a second that 's forgiven um yes i uh i sent um all the congratulatory email he came back with an invitation to have a coffee with him and discuss areas of common common ground we might be able to work on together thank you nothing else for you thank you councillor givens yes i 'll just say this 22nd of july there 's been meetings and some correspondence with ashley hathan regarding the aged care support goes across the 18th of july and then a response um what could be the brief on that i 've had some questions myself about it so this was good well we have um at the last at the last 1920 covered situation that we 've had we formed a community support network which involved and members of the community and health professionals to make sure that nobody fell through the cracks and support people where we could that that network is never folded it 's still there so we are now bringing and ashley has asked to join um that network and that was that 's what that is about ashley you 've now joined the network and working quite actively with image very good um the lord mayor of sydney cleveland on the 20th of july page nine there 's some radical things happening there is that the simplify or more control this is something that is metro focused it 's it 's part of her election campaign um it doesn 't really relate to them to the region specifically at all that 's it thank you thank you any other questions on this one thanks for watching uh thank you madam mayor um on the 26th of july page 10 four items down from the top um what is the score current situation with telstra is the 5g operation 5g is operating in oberon is operating in oberon councillor um i 'm still attempting to get the regional manager here to oberon to speak to our community because there does uh continue to be issues within the community with a whole range of telstra services but i 'm not having give you an update madam mayor there was meant to be a telstra technician attending but he has been because he went to armadale he was prevented from coming to several property properties around the in the local government area um that was the view of several problems that people were having but who knows that it 's probably likely he would not be able to come to nova after november now with the current lockdowns um in relation to the last item on page 11 professor john uh gurmov i think i 've pronounced that properly or germos um is that regarding the charleston university financial results and the problems they 're experiencing because of lack of international um students etc that was their 2020 financial papers audited financial results yes happy to forward you a copy of financial results okay it was just he was forwarding the results to you is that correct yes it wasn 't it wasn 't a common financial results sorry council i missed that it wasn 't a commentary in relation to the financial results and the reasons for the financial results oh as per say no okay thank you madam man that 's all i have thank you counselor johnny page 11 august uh residents of ocelo discussions uh about this um proposal the idea of footpath long box platinum beaconsfield road can you give me some idea of what concerns or support there may have been them no concerns no concerns councillor um mr chandler would like to be part of the consultation process and we 've agreed that that should be is fair and reasonable sure okay thank you very much any other questions on this one just briefly madam mayor any any follow-up on the community banking discussions that you 've had with um we have formed a committee of 10 people and we are meeting um with i can 't think of his name officer in my head but i can certainly let you know at the rs well we were meeting we may still be meeting on the 6th of september to discuss actually what this involves because none of us really know so we need to find out what it involves before we really start thinking thank you the other questions i 'll put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 4 notice of motions item 1001 o 'connell village fund the motion is that council support the o 'connell valley community group by way of a 1000 by way of one thousand dollars from the o 'connell village fund to assist in the finalization of the brand for the o 'connell avenue of trees a mover please excuse me a second to place councilman party do you wish to speak to the nation um madam may just briefly that um council supported the o 'connell valley group 's application for this grant which was successful their work uh the value of ten thousand dollars has been done down there and there 's still a few stages to go part of the success of getting the grant was that council and the group show some buy-in the group is going to be working on propagating uh trees and um and uh and council was the original application was very kindly um offering um a a thousand dollars or i think it was originally two thousand our support so this is just part of uh paying the bill thank you council council kathy it 's pretty straightforward thank you thank you any other comments on this will come to us for the recommendation all in favor aye thank you page 13 councillor and deliberate reports item 1101 institute of public works engineering australasia 2021 local roads congress the recommendation is that the report item is received as information and luba please counselors council agreement council thank you council givens would you like to speak to us did you throw the chair was a very good day for particularly the people of us that are interested in road work and i think we 've given a fairly good coverage there of what happened down there on the day and uh just some of the things that come to my mind was uh the well-being of our staff this amount of work that we 've been doing in all councils keep an eye on their workforce and look after each other some of the stats there are a bit mind-blowing with uh 39 400 people there hospitalized which you don 't really think about ninety percent of roads are controlled and maintained by local government councils and uh you know country roads the 68 of all the fatalities uh the wake-up call when you think there 's you know five million in sydney and maybe a million in the bush that all the accidents are happening here so i think the aim of it is to get us to continue with getting our skill levels up training and uh give support to the engineering because a lot of engineers leave and go to private enterprise so you know we 've got to keep the skill levels up there but [Music] the other thing that happened was we had a series of principle a presentation on rebuilding local infrastructure and the effects of the fires not the direct effects the effects on the community 's ability to rebuild and there were some lessons to be taken away from that a lot of it comes down to local councils rather than external authorities dictating what 's happened hey what is happening and local councils to do a lot of the ever since i 've lifted the district and ever since i 've been always thought the council should always lend its voice to the road safety message to all groups in our community through the schools and to the adults just through your column or and i think some of the numbers in here um enforce that because geographically we have this huge commuting pathway of batman 's presidents coming here to work over on residents going the other way and i think we should be um ever willing to stand up and and bring this to the attention of this community thank you councilman any other comments on this one councilwork with recommendations all in favor page 21 councillors committee reports item 1201 over on youth council i would put the term we need to change this recommendation before i call for a mover the ovon youth council put a recommendation in their minutes to council and it should have really been included in the recommendation so i 'd like to change the recommendation that we receive report item 1201 as information and that we note the recommendation by clc and the overall public school and bring back a report addressing this issue i 'm happy to move that recommendation if i can get a second one counselor thank you i am i did um put that adjustment in there because i think when our youth council takes the trouble to recommend to senior council something that they would like to see done or something that 's important to them we should actually take it up we should act on it and we should get back to them indicate that we are taking notes and what they are saying is important to us so that was my reason to adjust that recommendation council cable would you like to speak um there 's no light there and you can 't see and then it 's not that they 're concerned about security so much as um [Music] um yeah the the minutes of the metering are included there madam mayor and there are good coverage of what happened i would draw your attention to yeah that swept the path the fact that they are running a raffle i ask everybody i have some tickets with me tonight any other comments on this one counsellors can we what was that sorry [Music] page 24 councillors item item 1202 black springs community hall committee the recommendation is at the report with receivers information can i have a mover please counselor givens and counselor people thank you councilman would you like to speak to this report yes sir the chair knows a very good meeting [Music] we discuss the whole improvements and from that meeting um it was taken for the community association meeting and the next meeting they will identify the the major projects that we 're having to have done there and i think you know speaks for himself where we 're going there and there 's a lot of interest there and [Music] now our priorities are fairly obvious and it was a very good mood thank you mr careful now the comments on this one councilworks with the recommendation all in favor mary thank you page 26 councillors reports the decision item 1301 develop an application 102021 281 proximity of proposed willing to boundary before i put the recommendation down it states which requires a reduced setback of 41 meters that should be 35 meters if you could just that would be fixed up if you could just keep that in mind the recommendation is that councilberry part b14.12.9 dwelling setbacks and buffers of the oberon development control plan 2001 associated da 102021281 for a dwelling with a boundary setback of 35 meters from the eastern boundary of lots 3 and dp 1107 849 being known as 290 black bullock road has abroad that counsel that a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. can i have a mover please mccarthy do you wish to speak to this one um yes on two ways i don 't have a problem with this in respect it 's one of those blocks that was there before the lep but i spoke to the general manager before and incumbent also on this block is a 5 000 deposit on the site for a house and um on completion of this house on one and whether we can give the direction that that money could be because of a relocatable houses it 'll be still required because this is going to have a relay capable house but once a day is finalized i think we should refund the money did i get a comment about in other words it was required to be there by the last three owners from fisher to sinclair to now the present owner and at that stage i think the money should be paid back to the owner because we require for this one it 's kind of a relocatable house isn 't it i believe so so can i ask for a comment benefit of all counsellors from either director of planning or the gentleman um just through the chair council mccarthy 's correct that council holds a 5 000 bond in relation to the to a previous da that was approved as part of this development council generally indicates that that subject to knowing where that relocatable house is gone if it was to be removed from the site then you can return the bond because the bond is the is the the ticket that tries to get someone is 5 000 over there and i would suggest that as part of any da moving forward that with the transfer of property that that bond would go with that transfer so if we were to return it it needs to go back to the current property are you happy with that council mccarthy yes madam all i 'm trying to do is highlight the council something that 's onerous on the block yeah and simplify it so that we don 't have to get a report back tying up staff time tying up everything it 's required it 's still required because this front of this house is coming from elsewhere but once the da 's completed i think the money should be refunded to the present owner thank you the general manager has just said that it will go back all right okay no that 's fine that 's fine okay okay page 29 counselors 1302 developer development application 102014702 modification to subdivision the recommendation is on page 30 that council approved development application 102014.702 to modify certain conditions of consent for 45 lot subdivision of lot 1 with section 4.16 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 and conditions contained within the report for the following reasons the modification to condition three buffer management is to correct an error the modification of consent to consent 4 land contamination condition is refused and it is not deemed to be in the public interest to not provide a site audit statement that the modification to condition 17 street lighting plan condition is refused as it is not deemed to be in the public interest to not provide street lighting to a new 45 lot residential subdivision that the modification to condition 19 provision of services regarding removal of natural gas is supported as natural gas is not available that modification to condition 31 the site constraints plan is to ensure appropriate matters are addressed at the da stage and unreasonable restrictions are not placed at the subdivision stage but the overall modification remains compliant with the over on local environmental plan 2013 that the overall modification remains compliant with the overall development control plan two that a division be called in accordance with secretary in accordance with section a mover please that 's mcclellan thank you in a second of those councillor kevin thank you councilman kellum thank you madam um the land contamination which is of course the street on that um that is actually being changed to the validation does not have to be done until further through the process i think that is reasonable and that does not remove any protection for anyone who might be buying that land street lighting the proponent has used some what he sees as precedence for um subdivisions in recent times that don 't have street lighting but of course that does not answer the question of the extra density of this particular sub-development development is much higher density than titania or kings creek or brackenridge and we have had conditions applied to large block rural residential in um in the connell district recently so i think there 's that is a good reason to maintain street lighting for the safety of the substantial number of people who will be living in this area and the arrange the removal of the requirements of natural gas is perfectly reasonable and business paper can we unmute councilman thank you thank you thank you madam man um sorry um i 'd agree with that counselor kelm in relation to all the matters um and as the uh proponent is obviously supplying electricity to each of the lots conditions provide street lighting although more onerous is not overly onerous and i agree um that the lot size in this area is much smaller than in a lot of the other areas where there are no street lighting which have been used as examples by the proponent um so it 's all over and having read throughout through the report um i would uh i am very happy to second this recommendation thank you councillor do we have other comments council mccarthy if i can get a second oh i 'd like to move the limit that we delete 0.5 as if i can and then go ahead with the recommendations so your recommendation is how do we put this uh delete just take out 0.5 yes is there a second one [Music] it 's okay okay councilman mccarthy do you want to speak it to do diluted it 's already been done the bowel and the bpm and the bowel for the whole estate has already been done and one of the conditions is there that you retire 25 000 liters of water for firefighting so here we are putting another condition on a da stage that 's already been addressed the development stage so i just don 't think it should be here i think it should be eliminated um it 's just one of those things that the person and it says here in the scope of things that who 've [Music] and i think it was carried out four years ago and and what why do we yeah a voice by management report bob barnson 's december 2017 so why don 't we reimpose this thing i i understand that when you submit a d.a it 's not required if things are straight ahead but if you 're modifying the conditions that are there by going closer to the boundary or going to do something different that 's in the v8 then you 've got to get it modified and have already been addressed in the development stage of the estate and it should be deleted i 'm sorry but it 's just a double dip as far as i 'm concerned you know referring to section 31 page 44 that 's that is before us which was highlighted in yellow i would like uh an opinion from the director of planning as to uh this suggestion thank you councillor through the general manager to the director of planning thank you madam mayor through the chair um just in response to your question counselor danny hopefully you can hear me okay um the the report that was submitted with the the current da was for bell 29 or that that 's the assessment that was reached um if in the future the proposed da 's that were submitted for dwellings wanted to be different to that they would need to modify this dea by taking out this requirement it it moves it to the lodgement of the d.a for a dwelling so they may wish to locate their dwelling perhaps closer to the bush and require a bowel 40 or time to do so and and therefore the construction of the dwelling would need to come would need to comply with the australian standard for that for that bowel bowel level um so that 's that was why we uh as staff had agreed to allow the the condition to be amended thank you director another comment on this one councillors writer replied i 'll castle uh just a comment not on this particular point i 'm the build an envelope and and the requirements are there for distances then when they change it then it comes back to council and administering your fire ratings at the moment they 've gone to all the trouble using barneson 's to do an overall thing of the whole estate which come up with a rating and then now we 're asking for another one you 've got to modify if you 've got a modified then you 'll that other part will trigger that you 'll require a different fire rating and then that if someone goes ahead and uses the building envelope remember these have got a building envelope and they within that why impost another condition on them through the generation just through the chair um and maybe there 's just some confusion cancelled because as part of the new condition 31. the modification endorses that so if you have a look at on page 44 the line through the requirements on that site contracts plan removes that bushfire thing in accordance with your commentary is that is that does that assist no it doesn 't assist at all all i know that if you if you 're having your staff and you don 't get rid of the thing then they 'll imply apply it so just again through the chair it 's proposed and supported to remove that dot point as part of this modification so it in fact it supports your commentary it 's yours you 're saying you 're going to do it at da stage now this is the subdivision so yeah so what we 're saying is that each dwelling will be assessed on its merit at d a stage and not have this provision put upon at the moment you 've already done 've got a report from barnes in 2017. so now you 're going back and if someone complies with the da they 're going to have this requirement at da stage in post-on if they could meet all the requirements they shouldn 't have that condition applied on the da stage because it 's already been done over the whole estate you can 't have it both ways i don 't think through the chair once again and damien i 'm happy for you to correct me if i 'm wrong but my understanding by removing this condition from the proposed subdivision it removes the need for any dwelling to comply with the current bell 29 standard and it refers it back to an individual assessment at da stage is that correct damien yes these directors indicating yes so by removing this condition removes that requirement to construct the dwelling at bowel 29 which in itself may having substantial encumbrances on which general manager i understand what 's going on i also understand what goes on in that department so please i 'll put something forward okay i 'm sorry uh the dot point are you nodding your head councilman given here the dot for that point five be removed i 'm putting that amendment all in favor against the amendment 's defeated we go back to the original recommendation is there any other comment on the original recommendation counsellors tell us just commenting on the live situation yeah for a rural area um these are they 're going to be dimmed down i mean people are leaders that look across that way the countryside and that will they be impacted people that live within the four or five k 's that have got view of that the subdivision there will they see this lighting up and looks like a town instead of a rural city or i 've just been asked these questions i see here where five out of six submissions supported the removal of the street lighting requirements and i probably didn 't read it hard enough because they 're going to be set alight at each uh intersection or each block or what are we asking i 'm happy to go to the director thank you the director of technical services if i may um the the actual design hasn 't come in at this stage it 's it was for uh at consuctions if it 's constructed severe stage and um the director of technical services has had a little bit of input but so i 'll defer him to you chris um through the chair look uh the damian is correct there where he identified that the the lighting design has not come through from the the client yet or their or their consultant however yes there is an intent to put a street light at every intersection for the various reasons of uh for safety i would believe that it wouldn 't have an impost on um the neighbouring developments of that area so it 's more so um for safety and the additional um traffic movements that are generated as part of that development for nighttime movement [Music] um i have read it i can 't find it um the building envelopes prescription i have two things can i have some um comment on um i fixed these building and effluent envelopes is um proves to be completely flexible and ineffective in attempting to achieve what his original motivation may have been i have some comment on building envelopes and and uh to a lesser extent the uh waste except councillor we 're not discussing that 's not supposed to be amended um uh some time ago i um used to raise the the issue of a thing that they call dark night sky um which is particularly relevant for oberon and that is where the policy is to have a light audit and design lighting in such a ways to minimize its spread target and if as much as possible um now i 'm quite sure the developer has come with the idea of maybe we don 't need street lighting because street lighting will be a significant impulse and the um adjoining landowners on the high ground of titania will be looking directly down on this new settlement beside them so there 's different motivations coming as to why some would like street lighting removed um from the aspect of titania you will be looking at house lights and i outnumbered by house lights unfortunately however um i i don 't want this removed because i do want the possibility if um residents wish it to be there for there to be street lighting but i think sometimes there 's a more creative space between the two parties and i think there could be a more creative design of street lighting now i 'm no specialist but i 'm assuming for example for a start you can have lower ground level street lighting illuminating an intersection rather than a great big overhead light splashing light everywhere so i i just urge the two partners from my point of view to maybe explore more creative designs in their in their street lighting thing because they are out there it 's not um uh it 's not just a black and white consideration so i 'm i don 't like endorsing the lighting design but i think it 's necessary that i would be very pleased to see the parties come up with a more creative design that does hugely lessen the impact of life thanks for any other comments counselors mccarthy lighting i 'll go ahead and there 's a call for it to go in at places like over nils estate now that for security reasons um [Music] this is the a stage and if the developer installs it there 's no cost to council and the other thing is a lot of these lots are already sold so the people know that when they 've bought those lots if they 've gone through the da system that the lighting 's going to be supplied so it 's not just a matter of four people saying that they don 't want the lighting which could be just still family um it 's it 's the other people that purchase these lots in good faith and somewhere along the line also with all these conditions in this estate we need to send a copy of all these conditions to the three operating real estate people so that there 's no come back to the council of all these conditions or we didn 't know when we boosted it i 've made them perfectly aware of birdwind yourself to them but if come back and say oh i didn 't know i needed such a bigger tank it 's it 's ugly i think this street lighting should be upheld and um go on each intersection thank you castle tell us i 'm putting the recommendation all in favour married unanimously hustler mckibben are you in favor thank you 54 councillors item 1303 develop an application one zero two zero two one three two one signage at one hundred and sixty seven harvey 's road oberon the recommendation is in two parts the council vary the restriction as to user on dp868446 to allow the development of signage within a 30 meter boundary of the site that a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. can i have a mover please councilman cuban and the second council of caitlyn thank you council mckinnon do you wish to speak to this um thank you madam mayor um look obviously the signage is already in place um no it hasn 't been approved by council um and has been in place for some time um obviously the so i i i 'm happy to uh move this recommendation i 'm assuming the reference to the gains room which is referred to in the papers it does not require us an approval by us as a council um and can be endorsed by the planning director himself is that correct that 's correct i 'm happy to move the recommendations uh one and two thank you councilwoman councillor people yeah um that clears it but for me too i was a little bit confused about the mention of the [Music] from this one councilwood it 's just seems funny that every gal on this side is done and then gets approved after um right under the original slab that was supposed to be 180 meters off the boundary and ended up 80 and the council is liable if the slab gets cracked from the blue metal quarry but uh yeah just seems that these people must have known what they 're going to i think they 've got the sign made lately but you know anyway it doesn 't defies they just go ahead and put it up 's what we all should do check those comment counselor thank you any other comments here councilman put the recommendation all in favor very thank you 59 councillors item 1304 black summer bushfire recovery grants project prioritization the current recommendation is that council allocate up to 2 million up to 2 million from the list of project options identified in this report the council submit nominations to the black summer bushfire recovery grants program by the 2nd of september 2021. i will just comment before i call for remover for this that this funding is secured it is secured for oberon not the council the community can also apply but it is secured so what we 're looking for tonight is favored projects they don 't have to be in priority order so can i have someone to recommend council capital councilman kevin do you wish to speak to this um yes madam mayor um i would i um since looking at the prioritization and i know that a number of us have put our priorities through the general manager um there has been some update clarifications from the grants general manager mine the grants officer has indicated there may be a number of councils that do not take up this funding and it is possible that we could get could receive more than the million also in relation to the sewage treatment plant which was item 8 in the priorities list um there is some divergence to the views as to whether it would fit the chrome criteria um however the advice again from the grants officer is that it may very well fit into the criteria and if it is not does not fit the criteria then the second third and fourth priorities or however money much come up and make up the amount of money 1.6 million or some greater would then fall into place so there is no there should be no reason to preclude us putting the stp up as a project um for this uh for this recommendation now madam mayor i 'm assuming at this stage you you want to you don 't want us to go around and provide our priorities or whatever well we will have to do that um we councillors uh submitted anything previously so we will have to go around the room we do have yours though maybe i could yeah maybe i could speak to that madam mayor if i could in particul which i i just touched on i have put the series treatment plan up first because i think whatever we need to do is we need to we need to limit any necessary borrowings on this item and if we can get 1.6 million towards this project that will significantly reduce our our borrowings and i think it is the most although it 's not a visible project that our politicians may see us as being in the forefront of things like sports centers or the community hub for oberon 's existence and our out our ability to bring new people to over on and our ability to provide a sewage treatment plant that meets the all the epa requirements this is of crucial importance to the town of oberon and therefore i am putting the stp as priority one noting that and it also means that with things such as bulk expansion etcetera can make that so that help adds to the economic viability of oberon and and surrounds um and i think by tying all that together we may very well meet the criteria for this project for this for this funding and therefore that 's why i am putting the sewage treatment uh plan first obviously the general manager is the list of my um second third fourth etc i don 't need to go that through those but that is why i am putting the stp as number one thank you carlswell house paper would you wish to speak to this before we go around the room at all council capable oh sure you don 't wish to speak to this before we could start [Applause] councilman you do have yours do you wish to speak to them now oh yes i did copy all the counselors in and they 've i had the fitness center stage two is one that i had uh three sports and recreation ones kind of coupled as the as a one two and three but i 'd like to say that we probably they those that sport recreation and fitness type precinct that we 've started on over there recreation grounds had some major improvements and there 's still some more to come but with a little bit more speed on it and then also the fitness center stage two then you know we 've got that precinct down from the pool down to the tennis courts um which is probably as good a facility as there is down the size in the regional areas if we if we finish it off i added the hockey fields one in on that um to the new as part of the new sports complex on albion street um as well because a very popular sport um in this area in our our teams both men and women and juniors we 've got to travel the battles from the time now i think we should be looking at supporting the possibility of having a combination science field equality field with the amenities so that our kids in also the adult clubs don 't have to travel away every week to play so that would also complement that councilman kevin 's comments on the stp um i i don 't have an issue with it being a prioritized high business uh the others the comments i made on them were pretty straightforward i 'm happy to go with that thank you catherine that 's a lion um number one the fitness center two oberon recreation ground facilities number three aberrant businesses information center that doesn 't add up to 1.6 um but if i just do my top three no you don 't you do not necessarily have to meet the funding projects you 'd like to see prioritise uh i i i had number one the fitness center i can 't go past the opportunity if i 'm going to schedule the hall in there if i may as far as it may be now these these grants are open for the community and um do we know what grants are being sold by the community at this stage okay um well i 'm happy for the fitness center stage too that 's important um i 'm happy that we get some heating in the black springs pathway down to our coal and everyone wrapped around thank you um i would like to list the fitness center the hockey background upgrade iconic pathway uh the fitness center halfway at october background facilities open vic stage the the sewage project for two reasons one my reading of it is that i 'd be very surprised i doubt that would be eligible the other thing is that that i think that that is the sort of thing that we should be borrowing money to complete um and and you know that 's that 's one of the one of the things that the financial people tell us is that to get jobs done we need to go out borrow the money and get it done particularly in the present climate so we 'll get back to where we should be um i i put my my first one was the fitness center because it was promised to the community right from the outset um black springs hall um both stage one and two the the visitor information center is is a very important building in every center in every staying a little bit tired and and i think it really does need some money to spend on it and to make it smarten up so that visitors to the place are welcomed by an impressive building a blue tree a normal pathway um the main thing main area i don 't think we should be supporting the silverworks like i agree with councillor next to me that um you know we we have things like 88 lots of springfield street that will be bringing in 880 000 contributions towards the sewer work so they 're the sort of things and and the loans that we should be working on financially but i just want to comment and i i do support it but not in the hundred thousand dollars this pedestrian way at o 'connell was pursued before and i thought the request was about five or seven thousand all the sudden becomes a grant that 's a hundred thousand i don 't agree with all this just because they 're grants why is it price inflated like if you give it a mean like you 're told before i thought that was priced by somebody it was about five to seven thousand all a sudden now that it 's agreeing i remember cancelled callum saying cable saying before used to be the community used to put in but now stand back and let 's get a grant and just let someone else do the work but anyway that 's thank you for my time your time yeah is that in front of the pedestrian or after that i don 't want the pedestrian in there scrub it out because i 'm still going for that some clarifications for the three items or just like this and i said i believe my instruction was three items the other counselor asked me that time so i would like to add some items to the end of the very truncated list i gave you i did state at the outset counselor that it was just your favorite projects there 's no limit on it happy to take them off well i i saw clarification with both understood so i i did one i did the fitness center the red ground the the uh pathway um and the uh the hockey field thank you very much um eight of nine councillors picked the fitness stage two as one of their priorities so i think that that should be one of the preferred options which puts us at 420 [Music] the retail revamp for phase one of the oberon visitors center upgrade that is the next um the next one was the wreck ground upgrades with 150 the six councils supporting it and then we move into the hockey field at five together with the natural pedestrian pathways at five and the black springs upgrades and it is 51 for the black springs five councillors um for all five matter man um so if you could indulge me for a second given that the hockey field of 1.6 would be the nominal 1.6 we include that as a option but i think we should also look at other options up to the 1.6 again similarly to the stp as council on the cuban has indicated that might be the option so that 's 900 that 's a mill that 's 1.1 1.15 so i could but the the grants officer did say that there is a possibility we will receive more than 1.6 because councils will not take it up and she did send that to me in an email yeah so given that they are the multi-faceted support from council my suggestion would be that we prioritize submit all those as part of the as part of the council 's funding priorities and go from there that the dividend with this one is that it 's not really a priority because you send away your projects and then they get put through a matrix from the grants authority and they 'll spit out which ones you get back so so we could put them all in and then let them do that so that is the other option madam there because the stp as council is aware but we 've already prepared business cases for that but it 'd be just up to council whether they want to see that one go into this funding bucket as well together with all these other projects or as as has been indicated whether it applications for it at this point in time so it 'll be entirely up to council to make that decision okay i think the feel of the room um was that we seek other funding for the stp am i writing this i support the other council 100 and it 's also my field that we put the other one two three four five six seven projects in as is in no particular order cause for consideration perfect we can take it out for smart water meetings okay and the community hall that that community ohio is leave one vote so i 've left it out okay seven projects we could make it 's just a whole assembly section okay so we need a recommendation now then it 'll alternate recommendations i 'll be the move in the that list yeah i 'm just waiting for sharon to get to this oh okay is that okay like that are you sure if the is that okay on the screen of the movement second or endorsement there is council supported stage one of the visitor information revamp but only two supported phase included or removed as part of this well i think in fairness that we 're taking out other things we should take it out there there was the only stipulation there was there was multiple votes for that there were there was two but they supported both the first and second stage so in that space it was a lower prioritized councilman council are you happy to put in phase one yes yes thank you very much okay they 're happy with justin the mover and the secondary councilman kevin and councillor cable happy with the amended recommendation house on the keyboard thank you so much there 's no further discussion of this i 'm going to put the recommendation as it sits all in favor mary thank you 86 item 1306 over on water mains articulation cleaning tender t202112 the recommendation is in two parts the council nominate the open open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with cause 166a of the local government regulation 2005 for the cleaning of water reticulation system overall that at the conclusion of the tender period a report be provided to the suitably qualified company to be engaged is there a mover please councillor mckinley thank you patrick given um going on with the quality of our watering domestic and commercial um uses this is just something we 've got to do as a high priority it just has to be done because okay [Music] mckinney says it 's just something that we have to do uh and we 'll get a proper report at a later date thank you councilman cows wanna kill him better mayor i would ask this be moved to confidential it has implications it has implications previously it has implications for previous resolutions passed by this council i 'm not sure um through the through the chair just to give um some back additional background is that this report seeks council 's endorsement of an open tender method to go out and scope options associated with the cleaning and the [Music] available options to go through a complete network overhaul and a report coming back to council after that may have implications for council to consider in confidential but the way this report has been structured at 's endorsement of an open tender method to look for a scope around different options available for council to consider a complete remains clean councilman the fact that we are considering taking this action in relation to resolutions made by this council may place this council in a difficult position i make that comment i can 't say any more because we 're not in a confidential setting but being going into confidential has to be justified under the act counselor and i 'm not i can 't speak to this i cannot speak this because we 're not inconfidential thank you and you and you will appreciate my background is a general manager who has control over the confidential section of council and through the chair based on what we are proposing and this is a an assessment that 's been undertaken by our technical services director is that he is looking for council support to go out and look at options relating to the cleaning and the upgrade or the or the upkeep the maintenance of our water system understand councilman kibben 's um comments and that may at this point in time given that we are simply seeking councils recommendation to scope options around the cleaning of our system that 's simply what this report is i 'm looking to to provide as there are many and differing processes that can be undertaken to do such a activity thank you general major so any other comment council councilman given through the chair this is something that you would do on a basis a regular not a regular basis but every few years or has this been moved by something else i thought no through through the chair this is not muted by anything other than council looking at its options and its system and looking to undertake a a tender to seek quantifiable quotes for the cleaning of its entire system which we would do every so often that 's correct or should it be so long shouldn 't have any implications for them thank you councilman any other comments here comes the councilman at this stage i i can 't agree with this um action in in respect of we asked in a report when we a report back for council whether that was a dead main up there um as the major main goes i think up alpha street across street street and then goes down herborne street under the railway line then goes to the factory we asked to know whether that resident was on a deadline or was he fed off the main line we didn 't get that report um and also i 've been asked about the um laundromat whether there 's any old um copper gallpoint in that articulation i still haven 't got a reply for that yet so neither of those issues council have anything to do with this yes it does because if we have that old gal pipe still in existence we should get it replaced before we do this cleaning we 've done this cleaning before madam there and we didn 't get a good result i 'm sorry but okay we spent money before but we need to know whether we 're cleaning we 're not cleaning out old gal pipes that kind of dislodge scale and all the rest we end up with will have that you can make that decision whether to go ahead or not when this report comes back so there is another opportunity for council to look at this this is just a request for a tender for options and i 'm going to put the recommendation counselors all in favor against councilman emotions carrie thank you page 88 councillors item 1307 policy review 113 enterprise risk management policy i believe that the deputy mayor would like to um add to this recommendation um we need to add to paragraph one that the general manager is authorised to make minor editorial changes prior to placing the policy on public exhibition because i feel there 's it needs a bit of editing to make it clearer thank you pastor kellum so we have a recommendation in four parts counselors but the general manager is authorized to make minor to make minor editorial changes sorry sharon the general manager is authorized to make minor editorial changes before the policy goes on public exhibition that the revised policy one one one three enterprise risk management is placed on public exhibition for 28 should no submissions be received revised 1113 be adopted as presented policy and that at the expiration of the exhibition period should submissions be received and updated report will be presented to council can i have a mover please counsel helen and a second advice given that you 've revised option uh resolution recommendation one yeah that at the expiry exhibition period should no submissions be received the revised policy be adopted as exhibited rather than as presented because you 're going to make some minor editorials to that so just as exhibited right this policy is the outcome of a number of risk management workshops undertaken by staff and some councillors and reflects what we think at the moment about how we bet can best manage our risk in an overall sense as i said i think there 's a need to be a few changes to it but in general it is uh on the right track so the changes you 're you 're proposing are on language rather than language rather than thank you thank you council [Music] any other queries on this one councillors councilman mccarthy it put it on exhibition next at this meeting at the next meeting why not do number one make the changes and then resubmit it for the next council meeting so you want to make an amendment no i 'm just able to change that i i 'm just wondering why it can 't be um yeah [Music] andrew 's trying to get your team out because i can only been only able to receive this by citrix i was actually hoping it 's a copy of the revised policy could be circulated in word so that amendments could be made general manager expeditiously in accordance with what the resolution proposed by councillor kellum um if that 's possible uh the second issue is um when would council get a view of the risk register because as a council we 're overall responsible for ensuring risk register is also appropriate and it 's usually looked at each six months or each year through the chair so the risk being the rich register has been presented to the arak committee on a number of occasions and it looks at those options circulate the current risk register to council should they feel the need to um have a look at that happy to do so well i think ultimately as we 're the governing body that it should be circulated to councillors again unfortunately i use the corporate experience the risk register is also always the major that reviewed by board at board level especially for anything that 's major it 's identified or severe and i think it 's incumbent on all all councillors to be aware of the risk and in particular those those high risk areas thank you councilman can i just clarify if the risk register has not already been circulated via an arric report to councillors um through the chair of wouldn 't yes yeah councilman cuban his answer is supporting it councilman can we get that information back to you because i know i 've seen it in the business paper thank you madam man thank you and once again through the chair happy to circulate that risk register to councils um and and will we can we get the enterprise risk management policy 113 circulated can 't convert not my only option to circulate that the council i support council mccarthy 's option of pouring this and then bringing a revised version hey i 'm deferring it counselor kill are you any objection to deferring this or uh you know objection um um perhaps might have been better process to actually send it out to castles for their views before it was presented this one in particular i thought was pretty important i have no i have no problem with putting it out for councils to review and and uh bring it back next meeting through the chair i 'm happy to do that but council will remember that um they were asked to be engaged in this process from the from the initial phase yes that 's what capable have you when you 're that 's what we want to do yeah okay so we need a new motion amendment for that to be deferred some would like to move an amendment someone other than councillor kellum or councillor people that this may be deferred and brought back to the next council meeting all the motion all in favor of the motion the matter be deferred thank you councillors 1308 councillors arts out west memorandum of understanding the recommended recommendation is that our own council enter into a new memorandum of understanding without southwest with a period 1 july 2021 to 30th of june 2024 councilwoman donald thank you and i 'm second up councillor cable thank you thank you no matter just to recommend the work of the organization recommendation all in favor there 's 99 house first 1309 edith road natural rock retaining wall construction tender there is an area here is there not sorry there is a clear [Music] sorry recommendation part a refers to the cleaning and water articulation system and oberon number three it 's another of the tendering issues so it 's just cut across so that should read council nominate the open intending tendering method as prescribed or is that a different amount of recommendations thank you councilwoman just let me share that again kevin got that can you see that councilman kevin it 's a revised recommendation i 'm looking for remover police councillors that 's you rock wall and this is just the next step in the process thank you council councilman uh no matter what madame speaks for himself thank you yes madam um can i be reassured uh given our discussions and progress to this point branding and signage etc should we not be logically looking at a selective tendering method i uh asked of um of staff through you madame mayor and in fact i 'm not sure but when we have discussed this before with council i 've either had the opinion or mistaken opinion that we would go with selectively during this job perhaps the director of engineering perspectives or the general manager of general manager chief director of engineering oh yeah through the champ look uh thanks councillor doni uh certainly i the the methodology uh for open tendering has uh looked at the open market more favorably in order to achieve uh more competitive rates uh rather than going to selective tenuring i think that it 's a very unique um process no doubt with regards to the masonry stonework that 's required uh looking again undoubtedly this with the interest i suppose in terms of how many competitors competitors or local competitors are like in all surrounding areas that it will attract to uh to this particular job it 's not certainly a small job and is it is expected to be of a significant value so we felt that it 's better to go to the open market through the open tendering methodology i 'll take that as a professional comment man thank you thank you councilman council mckinnon thank you madame if i could to the uh through you to the director of technical services um i note that previously we 've looked at a method of construction for this wall are we in our request pretenders specifying how we believe the wall should be built or are we leaving that open by just specifying what type of final appearance we require through the general manager to the director you 're you 're muted chris yeah thanks madam man um through the chair um in answer to that uh certainly we are looking with the view of uh competitive tendering with their own methodologies uh certainly with the natural rock wall face upon the actual exterior of the surface so it 's being left sort of open to see what structural integrity would be employed by individual attenders submitted so hopefully that answers your question can i just ask the question to the director while he 's there i 'm assuming that when it goes out to tender we will be specifying the type of rock we want to use um conversion with our other walls in the town yeah through the champ certainly it would be compliant certainly have to be compliant with the um like for like uh type rock walls that are existing around the uh the urban uh residential streets that 's correct the other comments on this one consoles counselor cousin it 's um christian summed it up like for like someone could compare and come back with a tender that they 're going to build one like the church hill which is not what we 're trying to achieve i think we 're going to have a bit better tighter specification on what we 're trying to achieve here indication on what they 'd like to see as part of the the retaining wall construction so it 'll be a it 'll be a process of trying to get competitors to come up with a design based on what council is already approved as the scope for that that construction thank you councilman sorry just for clarity i 'm assuming that if someone tend as a solid rock wall in basalt that has the appearance of the what we 're looking for that they will be considered equally with someone who uses better blocks and that puts a facing about on it that 's what i 'm really asking because i think that 's the gist of it we 're not precluding someone offering up a solid basalt wall as long as the appearance appears is with what we want so that 's why i 'm saying we need to specify what we believe is the final appearance how someone gets there should be um and as long as it 's got the engineering strength that should be all that we require if a solid someone comes in with block with basalt facing well that 's fine as far as i 'm concerned so i 'm just checking that the request for tender allows for that thank you council i think that 's i think we 're all on the same page here [Music] no one else has any comments i 'm going to put the recommendation counselors all in favor thank you [Music] page 101 councillors item 1310 investment policy 2211 the recommendation is that council adopts the investment policy two two one one can i have a mover please that 's what cable and the second i come from the kitten thank you comes with cable do you wish to speak to this one uh yeah and just that it 's um very straightforward madame may we dealt with it back in june uh it 's been on display those submissions received um yeah i 'm happy to uh to move be adopted thank you council mckibben uh i think you 've had a man yes broadening the investment policy as we discussed in june is obviously um now in a position to do that um and time we 've had no no submissions in relation to well against it all for it so i agree with them thank you councillor any other comments on this one come to us page 102 item item 1311 skate park shelter at the common the recommendation is in two parts council the council support the installation of an accessible barbecue picnic table bench and additional concrete pathway to and within the existing shelter structure adjacent to the accessible toilet at the skate park at the oberon common and that council allocate a budget of up to sixteen thousand five hundred dollars from the common fund to complete the installation includes bracket includes option one single accessible barbecue can i have a mover place case mccarthy and a secondary place counselor cable i wish to speak to this one council mccarthy uh she 's pretty straightforward madame the only thing is um some sort of ctv you know recommendation to do all this and keep our assets under control so they don 't get damaged okay yes i support this suggestion um it 's um it 's the right thing to a barbecue that is is a barbecue that 's there and a bonus that we have an accessible one as well we 're getting a lot of visitors down to that part of our town um and it 's uh just the right thing to do to accommodate them down there thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors councilman pick me oh yes man my question is basically on the cost to put a uh the double one in instead of a single if you look at the pricing for option one to buy the barbecue the single barbecue is 7100 and for option two the double bbq is only four thousand that 's why there 's 300 extra so we 're getting the second barbecue for the discount price at that rate for the look of it so i 'd be probably going for the double one considering that it 's going to get a lot of use that area is starting to get a lot of use and um maybe we should plan i don 't know how much funding is left or in the get i 'll have you have to go for the single one substantial fun just pointing it out that there 's a fairly discounted [Music] if anybody else feels strongly enough i 'll just ask how many um how many barbecues have we got in the comment there one two three three already i think and then this will be all right and then we 've got some other double sir the fish on the barbecue scheme how many have we got of those barbecues on the fish one at home i think the important thing is madam mayor that they 're all well used sometimes they could do with a little bit more looking after but they that they 're all well used and i think that if we put one or two down here [Music] from damian where 's this actual barbecue gonna sit like you 've got this um shelter and you 've got the um two tables and the two other things whatever they call them flat things that did sit so where 's the barbecue gonna go so the general manager to the director thank i i think the best location would be between the current accessible toilet and the shelter structure so sitting on the slab closest to the toilet facing that way then the the pathway would lead in from the existing pathway um either off the skate ramp or off the pathway uh towards the uh the dam so it 'll be out in the open the barbecue no it 'll be under the shelter through the chair it would be under the shelter on the edge of the shelter between the uh the shelter and the uh the top the the new toilet page okay all right page 103 i thought that that stuff went in there [Music] item 1312 road gravel source investigation report the recommendation is that further negotiations be entered into with foster corporations of files with regard to access to the mount david gravel pitch can i have a mover councillor gibbons thank you come to gibbons you should speak to this one yeah just through the chair read through it and uh i think that 's probably a fairly good option in the long run uh area the quarry out there is real hard material it would have to be crushed but you get your advantage then because it 's much easier to work with and spread i guess the issues with private quarries are that you know if you 're if you 're paying for royalties by the cubic metre of a ton uh you do you might have to do the d.a look after the responsibilities of the quarry you might get the owner selling the land out from underneath you and i think the one out fell timber way i know there is another privately owned quarry was there in the southern running and it 's fairly handy probably more accessible than the one we were looking at there and i guess if this other one with the forestry we can do a deal with them that might eliminate the need for going into a private pediatric mandate so i 'm happy with uh discussions to continue with state foreign thank you councilman yes what why is this um so much material needed out the fell timberway and why isn 't the president 's no great earth works out there isn 't it why can 't we just stick to the existing um requirement existing situation where we take it on a prescribed cubic metre basis so i can 't see them unless the wind towers are going to come in and snap all the gravel or whatever what 's what 's the problem with buying it off these this family uh on a per square meter base through the general manager to the director uh through the chair the the implications around creating da 's then opens the or paves the way for commercial ability for the particular owner of any property that enters into an agreement again has stated uh the property can be sold all sorts of things can happen you know certainly unless it 's tied down in certain ways in an agreement sense also the other implications are managing the particular gravel pit uh right through to life end of asset so uh they 're they 're the things that really uh probably aren 't attractive aside from the da um which does give the owner as i public and not necessarily do we have the direct entitlement over that particular pit once it 's uh given an approval so from that sense we are probably better going down the path of dealing with other government agencies in pursuing gravels that are of a shorter haul to particular road maintenance activities from a from a road gravelling sense i still can 't understand this this pit is out on an arm i can 't see whether there 's a big user of gravel if we source and want the soil 's gravel there 's the forestry fish off the road from shooters ill to uranus which apparently has good gravel maybe needs the same as what kerry said to the other one right but with these people where 's food through you madam where 's the need for all this travel that we can 't just use the existing requirement where is there a development going ahead out there that we don 't know of like i 'm getting out with these people supplied the gravel in the past on a reasonable basis and now we 're they can 't understand it uh through the chair we 've never had an agreement with any of these uh particular owners that we 've been speaking with um you know certainly dealing with forestry corporation it 's again it 's around about strategy and having uh access at the most preferable locations to uh minimize our costs or expenses in terms of maintaining the road network new cars from the cuban um thank you madam mayor um i like council of mccarthy um i 'm a little bit confused because there have been a number of gravel pits around the area where i live in one across the road from our house and one that was adjacent to our front ramp um arrangements were entered into with previous councils um and in fact the one of the pits access was given across land uh owned by me with no access arrangements free access to the pit was on someone else 's property so i 've always found land holders are fairly um flexible and have been you know quite willing to work with council on the basis that the gravel was for everyone 's benefit um i don 't think anyone has been ever gouged the council in relation to royalty amounts etc is the cost of using this hard basalt type gravel from the um forestry will end up being more expensive than actually coming to a royalty agreement with with a land hold i i i 'm only talking from what 's happened previously it was be fried over on council i think we were part of evidence at that stage um i just don 't know whether this these areas have been i 'm full i will support the resolution but i think investigation should occur with um current prospective land holders further in relation to gravel tips because i 'm i 'm not most landholders will willingly work with council on the places the gravel is going to be used for the betterment of all by the improvement of the roads in the area anyway um i know that the pit office at me that was on someone else 's property the only only restraints were that it 'd be covered and completed when it was that occurred thank you anyway i leave it to the technical services director but i 'm i 'm not completely convinced by the arguments point thank you there 's no further comments yes it 's just that 's just a clarification um in the past we 've had a report that when we graveled the ball ridge road come from the forestry pit and the material failed is this the same pit that we 're filming it from through the general manager to the director yeah through the chairs certainly not the same pit uh this pit is not located in those particular areas um so it is it 's a completely different pit we as i say again we 're in early discussions with them and trialling the material um we believe it will be of a bit of a caliber once it is uh put through a jewel crusher no doubt it 's not of a bass old nature it 's more of a uh it 's more of a white rock sorry i can 't think of the name in a minute but uh certainly would we stage like again it 's not uh superior material um you know in the western areas but um at this stage again we think we can blend it to uh to a better material than what we 've used in the past on particularly schumacher 's or baldrige road thank you and your comments because we 're giving them a reply yeah just to clarify the fell timber one uh yeah the the quarry that we were looking at was down fell timber road at fairway and a very small road in and it 's not a registered pit but council mccarthy might know the one that 's just past fell timber road on the abercrombie road that the council used to drag out of there that now dooley 's pit and i think council 's actually purchased something there recently i 'm not sure but it 's a real good quaintness in a real good location there with regards to the other one out of gilman i thought it might have been okay to continue negotiations there but it 's a piece in off the road as well and unless you can establish the cost of uh the royalties that are required by the land owners but anyhow that 's uh felt it felt timber area i think you should be sourced by a private travel quarry which we do around the place here in here thank you councilman i 'm putting this recommendation counselors all in favor sherry thank you page 106 counselors item 13 13 rural road environmentally affected there is a recommendation that council confirm the report and allocate a funding source for the program to undertake the works as outlined within the report before i call for a remover of this recommendation i 'm going to ask the general manager to speak to this because there is some funding that has become available that may assist with this after this report was printed yeah thank you madam mayor um councils will be aware of the report and note that in the report [Music] as part of undertaking a project in these areas one of those options was to seek grant funding for this um at the time of writing can officers weren 't aware but in the local roads and community infrastructure program that 's been um now i 'm outlined by the the state and federal governments in which council 's allocation will be 1.169 million dollars from that program there are options and council will remember previously where we 've undertaken programs around the colwood room that would utilize money out of this round two of this fund sorry phase two of this fund this is now phase three and there will be 1.169 million dollars available to council to look at projects for both local roads and community infrastructure so it 's just a funding source that council may want to consider when they have a look at options available to assist coming to a resolution for this report thank you madame i do recall general manager that you did speak about integrating this matrix into our road matrix because many of the roads are the same to take advantage of that funding um through three men through the chair um one of the options was to consider implementing a provision within your current matrix to allow a environmentally affected roads such council looks at development whether it 's a bus route whether there 's forestry activity on there one of the options that you could look at to in fact get an understanding on whether these roads change priority in your current matrix is to add an environmentally affected uh provisioner around that so you 'll note that there will there is also a number of roads in that that if this was to be included in your current matrix like carl wood road is the perfect example hardwood row is already one of the top priorities in your matrix it would go once again further as a priority i would i would consider the other one would be you 've already allocated money to units or road it would certainly go further up that that list the issue we would have is that at this point in time you have a matrix for seal if you have another matrix for environmentally affected roads it 's going to have an impact on on our engineering services trying to prioritize each of those of those um differing matrices which is why that not at all the environmentally challenged roads not for all of them with the solution the ceiling though that 's true that 's absolutely correct which is why the engineering the technical services director sorry has also created a program with what he speaks around mount olive and dreams road the councillors we can pass this rep we can call for the recommendation [Music] how would council feel about deferring this report so we can look at this funding that 's so we can see what this funding is about and see how i 'm here excuse me cancer i 'm speaking we can do some work around integrating the two matrix and just see how that changes things so a further report might optimize how we spend this money that we 're about to receive i don 't know what how council feel about that you can 't hear can 't hear anything hello can you hear me it may be your oh my god can 't hear anything where are you what can i do about that sharon [Music] sorry counselor can you hear me uh sounds like you please send us to say that there 's nothing we can do our end the the option potentially would be to mute an unused [Music] i believe it 's the uh graded sections of these roads that i 'd be pushing for not big long roads i think and i 'd like the isabella road to be included on that matrix that we have there as we 've spoken before we just can 't pick up these roads and work with them when there 's other roads with log trucks on them and people are staying big rates and think they 're getting neglected so i just want the isabella road included on that and i think when we go to try and divvy up the money and how we 're going to spend it we do have to look at the identified and prioritize the impacted areas and this is where you save your money by doing the hills into the creeks and up the other side and doing the steep stuff so we 've got to work out a way to share this money around fairly and they shouldn 't go back to works committee we must be just about two for one i 'm not sure when the next works committee is usually every six months and i think we 're well dude for once um through the chairline the last hole is in march so you 'll be looking around september october doesn 't preclude you will we bring back this report in september for consideration anyway so whether it requires a works committee or whether council want to consider it um it will be entirely up to to you if you want to if you want to defer this to a works committee my issue is that i 'd have to have a walk they 're trying to find out when the closing of the projects would be for this and whether it sits in that it sits within the parameters of the works committee all or more than having to bring it to a works committee it might give councils a better opportunity to discuss those those um those roads that they 'd like to see considered however i 've got to admit a matrix in its own right linking those two together may give you a better understanding before we either put this recommendation or take an alternate recommendation to defer the report should you further item pending a report to the next works committee would you like to move back and secondary [Music] okay i think it might be an elf problem oh okay okay so do you need a motion to suspend the meeting that you 're trying to suspend it in order to get injured is activity general manager sorry madame can i ask what happened with the previous item was deferred pending as bloke 's committee meeting counsellor item 1313 the recommendation is that report item 1401 is received as information can i have someone to move that way please counselor cape war and councillor thank you councillor people do you wish to speak to them before so thank you very much counselor kellum in particular another comments on this one counselors um scheme just um there 's the last bit there once the formal report has been received the virum team will look to compile the da at all through through the chair it was delayed because of covered however um the ecologist has now been on site and the report should be prepared reasonably quickly any other comments on this council mccarthy just just general comment um as the general manager did you monitor the da 's turnaround and when they 're submitted to when they 're actually sent out um through the chair i 'll do that through the director so is there a turnaround time in excess of 10 weeks at the moment um any other comments counsellors for the recommendation on invader harry thank you page 120 1402 monthly activity report planning and development the recommendation is the report item is received as information can i have a mover please that 's mccarthy and a secular counselor jonah thank you council mccarthy you should spread this one yes some same questions the director is out sooner than the aids now at approximately 10 weeks so when they 're submitted to when they believe back to the people that submit through the general manager to the director please thank you madame through the chair on notice um there is obviously um been an overlay with some longer application more difficult applications however um i can 't give you exact answer on that at the moment i 'll take that on notice and come back to you um is there a need for the council that have a spreadsheet so we have a monitor some if you can 't tell us tonight like there must be some basis that there 's a requirement by the local government act and i understand that we go out and resource more information which is not submitted in some das but some da 's that are submitted by professional people that submit in other local areas seem to get through and they don 't enable and i 'm just wondering why does it take what i 'm told is up to 10 weeks to get a da through over surely we should be moderating the turnaround shouldn 't you i through the chair right the again i 'd like to say that some applications don 't submit the required information and they do take longer um they do i happy to take that offline and probably if you can provide me with the people who have indicated that i 'm more than happy to get the drink okay no worries um and the other one damian um i wrote the general manager and i spoke to you about the um landscape and compost one and my concern was raised if you have a look on page 120 um right over in the um it shows a sign that my drives right goes right over to the extremity of the new development where on our map here it shows that it 's um um walking street it shows that nar drive goes right around so that 's that 's why i wrote to you and wrote to the general manager and there 's actually a council sign over on the um northern extremity that shows my drive so that 's where i 'm coming from it 's it 's a proper council sign showing that that 's my drive over there so on the wheel if you go i i read to the council saying that the development that 's the foyer is misleading but as you go on the industrial side and you head north in that corner so it 's on the corner of the two street yes where you see the access of the new development coming out there 's a sign this is that 's my drive still so whether someone 's lifted it from somewhere else and put it there let me have a look at that please so anyway thank you thank you other than that i 'm happy with the report thank you thank you um all right can i get a um a little bit more information on item number one if i may you know just more detail on what this business proposal is through the general manager to the director through the chair um it 's a previous uh was a previous da that was adopted by council um approximately a couple of years ago and it 's uh they did want to they were planning on modifying it however the requirements the current requirements required to be a new development application and as it is outlined it 's for development um and integrated so it will be um considered by the jrpp um yeah what what sort of um through you metamer what sort of what sort of raw materials are we looking is this similar to um other existing operations in batman in overall through the chair the composting would be green waste so possibly similar to other suppliers that 's correct yes i might ask um more later um can i also um just through the chair i 'm more than happy to have the director supply councils with a copy of the statement for their consideration thanks very much um that waste facility reports positively exciting um just um in a nerd coming out i 'm just wondering um how 's our i can 't_''_9757.68 be specific but i remember our funding model that uh gave us the opportunity to employ the consultant do we have any further funding for actually carrying out any or many of these recommendations through the mayor to either the general manager or the director through the chair there 's another report that we could we can talk about those options some comments on that is that applicable straight here or 1409 or independently at the end of this land development or about the weight about the waste facility facility do it through foreign thanks very much thank you councilman any other comments on this one councillors pudding sorry um also from the director is there any indication when the cardboards are gone in independent living united kurdistan i understand the slave is done so what 's the older stuff 's been done for some while through the chair the construction civic has been lodged with council um so it 's just and a deposit has been paid to the uh the uh the company so just um waiting on the approval for the for the construction event and uh and the timeline from the from the uh the company to install them so i 'm anticipating within the within the next within the month so the country 's putting them up correct yes okay thank you very much any other comments on this one counselor i 'm putting the recommendation all in over harry thank you 126 counselors item 1403 report item is received as information can i have a mover please gibbons and the secondary councilman cuban thank you council givens you wish to speak for report just one question is that um so the work the shoulder widening on the blainey road project uh the council 's won the contender for that have they or you were going to have a look at it and it 's been taught it 's been put back because of care of it through the chair um at this stage it the work has been delayed it 's still being worked through with transport for new south wales though the the work has not been awarded uh however we have been asked to put a submission together once the scope is ready to do so thank you thank you um thank you mr mayor um yes i 'm pleased to [Music] to uh to second this recommendation i know that many much of many of our projects have been put on hold due to the um exceedingly wet weather of the last several months um that 's a problem we can 't but no doubt things are drying out at the moment so hopefully we 'll commence again thank you councilman any other comments on this one councillors councilman um on page 128 when do we anticipate the matril o 'connell road construction starts uh through the chair certainly there 's just some discussion that needs to take place with uh an adjoining landowner um that may favor uh be favourable to the actual works outcome at this stage uh nothing has been established however we are looking to uh try to do something depending on resourcing and again uh coming back into the into the spring summer sort of season uh it may not be the sign of christmas uh however we 'll endeavor to do our best uh and as mentioned i think previously to council uh it may be something of a project that we need to package up and um and assign to uh to external contractors to be able to to fast track it so we 've got the design uh through the chair certainly we 've got an approval to go uh with a creation of transport for new south wales okay thank you thank you now the comments on this one councilman for the recommendation we 'll be playing harry thank you page 130 counselors item 1494 monthly active report corporate services the recommendation is the report is received for information can i have someone to move that please do you wish to speak to this one um thank you madame uh a thorough report um if i can just on the open city 's appointment um and i know it might have been given to us thoroughly last time i can 't don 't believe it was in the um notice of motion for action but if we could have a sort of time table sitting down what 's to occur um with the new new council website what when we 're looking for it to to be up and running where are we looking for the evaluation period the testing period etc and when it 's looking to be finally up and down and able to be used usable we would be good for all to know since um since the contract has a schedule to that contract that um um that counselors could be made aware of thank you councilwoman any other comments on this one council council sorry any other comments counselor customer card so in the report it shows that the balfour units are full which is good um we 're just wondering where the um drain of the second units up to i think over looking at that yeah i might defer that one to damien if you have any update on that one damien he threw the chair um we did look at that and we had council 's plumber have a look but perhaps it was uh it may be a separate matter that you 're raising councillor mccarthy is there a separate matter where the drain 's up to then has the drain been cleared and fixed um directly that 's my understanding that 's correct yes it 's just been cleared and there was a request for another pipe because the heavy storm it pools at the back door and then it goes away in other words the existing drain can 't_''_10231.52 take it but and get the water away from that when them occasions occur so it hasn 't been done yet if that 's if that was that was the request sorry through the chair then uh perhaps it hasn 't been done but i 'll i 'll take that on notice and follow it up for you okay thank you you have the comments here comes lou including recommendation all in favor thank you page 136 councillors 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is that the council receives a report for information a mover please counselors council mccarthy in the secondary council calling thank you council mccarthy can you speak to this one pretty straightforward we 're in the wrong game aren 't we after the commonwealth bank made the record profit no interest rates huh 139 1406 grant 's monthly update the recommendation is that the report is received for information the mover please counselors counselor kate paul and counselor gibbons thank you councillor cable do you wish to speak to this i 'm sure everybody 's ready council given you wish to speak to this that 's for the chair grant is it that we usually get every year that we 've missed out on here or not that we continue with that edith road each year is that the grant that we you 'd be fairly successful with that we 've been getting every year or not no i think this that 's a different this was this was a an actual program were you thinking of regular grants well the continuation yeah so this is a different one through chris 's crystal providence through the through the drake time yeah through the chair thanks madam mayor um it 's a grant it 's been a one-off grant that we 've actually applied through through transport for new south wales which was awarded to council for 1.95 million dollars they actually have paid that over two years where 1.6 million dollars was up until the last financial year which we 've spent which we still have a remainder of 350 000 to spend on that one but one-off particular grant on the abercrombie road and that 's related to the installation of audio tactile line marking which can 't_''_10388.72 for itself giving the adhesion to the road surface so we 're just waiting the uh the warmer weather to um to finalize that grant during the 21 22 period thank you any other comments here councillors councilman um thank you madame uh bottom of page 139 and uh top of page 140 the reasons given for refusing our stp grant amount under the bushfire local economic covering fund are interesting to support the project we need evidence of wider community support um well it seems odd that for sewage treatment plant we actually got to get letters from the community to support it when you know it 's an innate partner of any any town or city that they need an effective sewage treatment plant that complies with epa requirements i found that a bit bizarre and then the next comma the panel felt council limit experience in delivering complex sewer treatment plan projects um well most councils will have that problem because usually they only do one in about every 25 years that 's why we 've got consultants in um they were concerned about the risk of the department within the tight time frame proposing the application well we 've been working on that for such a considerable period of time and we 've been assured we will get approved the next one is um improved risk management strategic some depth so um and obviously the the final one the amount spent on overheads administration um so maybe the general manager could comment on each of those and give us his view that 's called the hospital thank you councillor um i i too have perplexed a number of the options that they 've given especially given the detailed business case that we submitted as part of this application at the end of the day i take the second last paragraph in that in that overview as the gospel that they 've i would believe that they 've looked at two proposals from council and picked the best one fix the best one that what politicians can use to you know say how it 's not true through the chair you said that not me i i 'm just asking thank you councilman hidden necessity for any with putting a recommendation all in favor page 142 item 1487 water and sewer plant report recommendation is it the reporter 's receivers information can i have a mover please also calum thank you in a second the council given counselor kellum do you wish to speak to this one two thirds class at the moment which is 66.66 page 145 councillors 1408 monthly update status of council resolutions the recommendation is a report item is received as information could i have a mover please council with papal and a second debate and a secondary place councilwoman council title do you wish to speak to the withdrawal no no no counselor um comments counsellors i 'm putting recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 157 item 1409 over on waste depot the recommendation is that the report item is received as information could i have a mover please counseling given the council of doni councilman gibbon do you wish to speak to the report can you hear me now macbeth we can hear you um look a very detailed report um and i think the motion which was put been bought out by the reporters to the changes that we need to make to the facility and also comments such as the general site condition um generally very untidy various ways spread across the entire site including concrete mattress tyres garden waste large logs and scrap metal numerous open pits were observed on the site while at least one was being used for the disposal of asbestos weights it was unclear what the purpose of the other pits were it is apparent that the state of the site may be resulting in uncertainty for customers as to where to deposit their waste this may account for the numerous discrete piles of waves observed across the site i undertake an extensive cleanup [Music] the site consolidating waste stockpiles will assist in this regard a large number of recommendations made in this report the short-term medium-term and long-term actions i note that the director of planning has included five immediate recommendations i think it is as i said i 'm having some difficult um but there are a whole lot of short term uh recommendations of about 18 um [Music] that if that 's correct is that is that correct through you madam mayor and through the general manager to the director of planning through the director thank you thank you through the chair uh yes councilman kevin that would be correct and uh i 'm actioning them as we speak the i mean the installation of a single laneway bridge is number 19 in the wreck in the list of recommendations are you intending to provide a report back to us as to the cost of doing that for instance because it 's quite a large expense one and i also note there 's a reference to the current equipment not being fit for purpose are you intending to come back to us with a report as to what would be more appropriate equipment and what would cost i threw the chair uh yesterday both questions and we 're seeking some quotations on the single lane um way bridge um i 'm just waiting on those uh to come back uh so would we are we going to have those at the september meeting or will it be later through this stage but if i forget the quotations and the suggestions then i 'll definitely be bringing you back to council for uh before for september yes and you 're also confident that the wc the pound and everything will be in location by i think you said september in the report we 're going through the chair i 'm anticipating the works will commence within two weeks they may take a little bit longer than anticipated however that is still the time frame correct um when do you anticipate that there will be three types of catchment on the site diversion dirty and leak shake and when will that be completed through the cleanup through the chair as a result of this um report we will be having further consultation with the consultant moving forward so um as the expert in this field i 'd probably take his advice and um um moving forward so will we have a at the september meeting do you and anticipate we will have a time frame for undertaking at least those things identified as the short-term actions through the chair that would the let 's say the items on page um 159 in your covering uh paper uh in two three and five numbered on page 159 which may double up with some of the ones in one two one to 18 as well i understand that in the in the consultants report through the chair uh council given that the um those one two three four five items are taken from the executive summary from the report so they do marry up with the recommendations so i 'll uh i 'll be um including those in a as much as i can in a report back to council correct okay but obviously item one won 't be done done you 'll only be providing a um a quotation and costing and etc if that 's available that 's correct yes okay all right basis of all that madam mayor and i i do think this is a very thorough report i 've read from one end to the other a very thorough report um and it does show a number of considerable number of shortcomings with our waste facility that was this report thank you councilman council dhoni thank you madame um as i said before uh i 've been on this um really quite stimulating reading um thinking that our waste and uh our recycling is you know one of our key challenges and also brought some into into clear light a whole range of comments um we 've made over a number of years i think it 's a huge job it 's a i think it 's a daunting job um and i think one of the key aspects of not only is the the development of hardware is also the development of staff with the resources and the ability uh to manage uh a good operation just a couple of questions uh on 158 one two three four paragraphs down the report the march ordinary meeting advised there are currently no unrestricted reserves within the waste fund so just in terms of funding where do we stand through to whomever can answer that question so you met him i 'm through the chair the reason why there are no unrestricted funds in the waste fund is because are substantial funds available to undertake these these projects have been earmarked for one the closure of the existing 50 year old landfill that we 've been working with for quite a number of years and the development of a new legion which is your approval that you 've already activated and what 's what sort of funding some identify that is separate from plant replacement funds or plant acquisitions or um through the chair that 's separate to the to the question however where where plant is purchased for the direct benefit of the landfill and they stay within the landfill and they don 't have an impact on the plant fund it 's funded by the wasteland earthquake so the perfect example is a compactor which council purchased previously um you know i look at these recommendations in the report i 'm very pleased with them because um um our waste depot has fallen far short of this for in my opinion far too long and that to see it come up to modern standards which it should in this town will be absolutely terrific i don 't of them but i don 't know what people envisage a good waste depot to look like but it 's it is quantum different from what we have experienced here in recent years and i think i think this is terrific thank you thank you thank you thank you man i think this is a great report uh i i like the fact that it 's got some time frames on what is seen to be the important actions i think what we need to see is an actual plan of how they 're going to be undertaken because it 's not going to be undertaken in 1 through 18 it 's particularly the short-term ones that 'll be all happening at the same time to a large extent and that includes the basic housekeeping stuff that 's um included but also the development of our people so they understand how way step ups meant be run and we need to have some funding against that i suspect that 900 000 may not go far enough and we need to prioritize with a risk attached um which of the particularly i 'd like to move amendment to the um to the recommendation and instead of being received i 'd recommend that we uh the report be noted and that the general manager provides an initial planned actions with costings to the september council meeting we 'll have a second amendment now just to explain that and i make i was very careful about putting initial because i recognize in a month it 's going to be really hard to get a really fine-grained plan and costings but we will get some sense of what we what our liabilities are and more importantly actually what our risks are justin the initial process of providing short medium long term was to in fact guide that principle of developing that plan as it says within the report one of the key things from the consultant was that because you don 't have a weight bridge the way you charge and the way you can in fact recoup is substantially limited and this then gives you the opportunity to look at those sort of methods so when you say can it fund itself it how we do that in the future and i 'm very well aware of that but i want to see something that we can hang our hats on at the next meeting thank man i can 't put it any better than what counselor callum already has um we need to um we need to have a plan before we start anything really and we 've got a good report we 've got a lot of actions there that come out of it the planning stage and the action stage should be uh as far as the wave reaches occur if we need to minimize we don 't have to have a permanent structure i mean you can hire portable weight bridges all those sorts of things available these days then you can move around the site whatever you can buy i don 't see having the weight bridge to charge um or to substantiate our fees being a real big issue but it 's probably a priority so i yep fully support council columns amendment and that 's all thank you carson technique there any other comment on the council columns said but what we 've got to do is management of the tip is these vehicles are turning up there and they 're described size already and if you work for the rta or someone like that these vehicles say that they 're a six meter body or their 18 meter body if they turn up at the tip with a 18-meter body they 'd pay for 18 metres of rubbish and that 's not what 's happening at the moment because there 's a bin service that comes from out of town and when he 's got a half a load on he gets someone to ring up one of our staff members and wins that he 's only got up a load on and now he wants to pay for half a load if he turns up in a truck and we designate prior to that he turns up we might need the spray bridge but take on board what nick said uh council mckechnie said he 's well aware of these way bridges they 're not here anymore but in the past we 've always to measure these vehicles that are turning up to the tip they are coming from out of town i see another one come there today with a hook bin on there going along those mount road it wasn 't a local truck so it 's well out there in the industry that abrams would take your rubbish cheap they 're making fortune there so these trucks it 's in their interest to fill them up when they go there not to go out there and then wins to our staff that they want to discount because they 're only half full councillors and build a huge amount of building wages coming in from that source yes okay counselors i 'm going to put the amendment has written all in favour that 's forgiven the amendment now becomes emotionally paper promotion unanimously thank you i just had one question madame if you can it says there on um the last part needs to be covered more frequently the answer director don 't support our staff to get that done in respect that we have a compactor we have a dump truck so they can move the dirt around us what what 's the director got in mind i 'm assuming this will come back with the director 's report comes on i thought he 's going to instigate some of this now if it will come back in a plan okay he 's doing next meetings by the september meeting thank you counselors page 160 item 15 there is no urgent business this evening page 1-6 page 160 item 16 pro session and confidential reports in accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government general regulation 2005. in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kind as referred to in section 108 bracket 2 of the act and should be dealt within part of the meeting close to the media and the i 'd like to thank the members of the public for joining this evening through the meeting i now call for a councillor to move council into closed session council mccarthy and secondary council thank you all in favor thank you i now request a minute separate turn off the recording closed sessions there were no members of the public present at the time item 1601 the council

for nearly 20 years i 've been working on the highlands estate subdivision for approximately 15 years i would really appreciate it if the councillors see fit to adopt my road naming suggestions i plan on completing more subdivision work in oberlin and if i 'm lucky enough to be granted the road naming suggestions for the highlands estate which i live in it would satisfy me into the into the future for road name i was spoken with lisa from the geographical names board this morning and she advised me that the suggestion of o 'neill road has been used elsewhere but council are able to ask for an exemption to allow the name to be used as the existing road in the gravel forest road and more than 50 kilometers by road and probably not many resident properties on that road if the option of o 'neill road for road one is not possible i would like danny 's road i would also like to have robbins road for road four in memory of my mother as forest road is not possible for a road four any help would be greatly appreciated regards chris o 'malley mr general manager and as this matter will be dealt with later through the meetings page seven councillors item eight confirmation minutes the

south wales parks and minister for regional roads the honorable paul toole mp to find out where the mayfield road turn off on the told it was in the 2020-21 program but nothing has happened another place mccarthy in the second place council mccarthy do you wish to speak to this motions yes mata may um i think just by sending this letter on it 's going to keep the pressure up as we 've seen with the unfortunate incident on the mayfield on the mitchell highway they tried to deny it but does it feel so we 've got to keep the pressure up we 've got to get this road intersection fixed it 's got bad side distance it needs to slip running and the ladder ain 't going across as much thank you all right and i refer councillors to the director of technical services report on page 113 um for an update on how council are continuing to keep the pressure up but i 'm more than happy to write a letter and agree with those sentiments no matter where i think council mccarthy 's supervisor you said thank you any other comments on this one coming to us thank you page 13 item 1101 council and delegate reports up the recommendation is the report item is received as information can i have a mover please counselor cable and a secondary counsellor given [Music] will be on the 6th of august other than that um straightforward thank you thank you councilman kevin um madame i actually wasn 't the author of this this was councillor cable so if you can make that change please on the top um and the next meeting on the sixth of august is currently scheduled to be held at blaine and there will be a follow-on she was smiling at me this has been kind of the cash say today um so that may change um yes um the only other thing is that there was a as council capable said there was a very strong commitment from the upper macquarie county council members that we should initiate um one or more cases to enforce by biosecurity obligations where uh because we have now there are a number of them that people have not complied with the penalty infringement notices so there was strong endorsement for a notice of motion that i actually raised so all methods of and thousand dollar fines that we should move to the next level um and in concept with that we have written to the minister for agricultural um minister marshall who of course also has covered um and the local member seeking some support for financing legal costs in relation to those potential actions because it 's nowhere needed for other in other areas the county council is is um facing one of the it 's a fairly serious issue this one i mean the county council is the regulatory body as far as weed control goes but the cost of initiating um legal proceedings he really is a hindrance and we can see why county council in the past hasn 't taken taken that action because um could wealth center grow without without some backup from from somewhere else and even even if the land holder involved in in any case is found guilty i think we nearly have to assume that the magistrate will say go ahead and spray your burst mate and without possibly without any penalty so it costs a lot of money it manpower time for the county council and for legal fees to mount a uh a case so it 's it 's an issue that the county council really has to deal with pretty seriously i think the county council has been skirting on this for many many years and i think it 's good to see a decisive action happening your comments counsellors i 've been recommendation all in favor thank you page 14 council 's item 1102 overall business and tourism association meeting 16th june 2021 the recommendation is report item is received as information can i have someone to move that way please because the time for the meet the candidates functioning uh will be six o 'clock on the uh ninth of september um before the fourth of september august yeah yeah well somewhere um um very interesting and i was pleased to see that so many presentations from several women who ran their businesses i thought was very excellent and i also note council cape will brief the meeting on um a number of um council actions which i think is excellent and i know the the road closures of hampton [Music] encouragement of women in leadership in our community and i think that brings significant benefit those of you might be aware even on the the iss research says that uh boards of companies that have the larger representation of women tend to be more profitable i know you 've put a lot of work into this a lot of ways i just see that as further evidence for your effort many reports page 16 item 1201 over on youth council recommendation is the council um a dynamic group there 's lots of information there that is that tells us what they 're going to do so i 'm sure that they will bounce ahead from here counselling the comments on this one counsellors i 'm putting all in favor thanks for the four councillors item 1202 black springs community hall committee meeting there 's a recommendation and two currents that council receive report item 401 as information should be 1202 i feel 402 as information and that council note the recommendation of the black springs community hall committee can i have a mover place you council okay do you wish to speak to this yeah i would like to speak on the recommendation the council contacts uh contracts an independent contractor to undertake the maintenance and pest order of the building to the report will inform the longer term maintenance plan um i think it 's imperative that a maintenance order be done we 've been talking about it for 12 months or more the need to do that we operate out there with a fairly small budget council operates with a small budget um of for maintenance and there 's been a lot of well very welcome work done out there with the benefit of um of grants but some of these things we 've seen cost overruns with the toilet um the new toilet upgrades because there was things once we pulled the floor up there was stuff that we should have known was there but we didn 't meetings have been talking for a long time about water pooling on the floor and coming down the walls those things surely need to be fixed before we start spending money even with a kitchen out there but it 's a really nice kitchen but we put it on a dodgy floor uh water pools on the floor and it 's going to be harder to fix those things after the work 's done and would have been to do it beforehand and then install the kitchen um i think we need to get an independent person we 've had contractors out there who were doing work have a bit of a look at it and they 've given us a bit of an idea but we need more than a bit of an idea we need to we need to have a full proper audit done so that we can work a budget on our planning for the next however long it takes and and categorize the jobs that need to be done and put them in some order and and just get the place fixed up thank you councillor do you think we have a major event coming up in 2026 so i guess to plan for something fairly special you need to really get started now and and um with i think we 've fixed that with the gathering that i overrun to be able to get someone there as soon as we can so us older people can continue to put help into that hall for the future generations and there 's money about to be spent and i know the association would like to even go 50 50 with the council in some areas we 're talking acoustics and meetings after we get a hall report so i 'm hoping we can really get a report on the hall done sir thank you council any other comments on this one mccarthy um someone has been under that all i i was really disappointed to see that they 'd seal straight up to their hall and never tried to divert the water away from the premises and that 's one of the things that really gets to you the movement underneath is related to the soft surface underneath and we should have known that that toilet block and all that was a bit dodgy because you can uh you know you can get right under that wall and get to dry that 's all and that 's all i 'm getting at and i don 't think we 've done enough when we hot mixed it out the front to disturb the water away from the friends thank you romero i notice um at the bottom of under general business of page 25 the comment about the concrete capping works having been performed poorly does the contractor been contacted this stage 1203 community services committee meeting the recommendation is that council would receive the report item as information can i have someone to read that please also adoni and the second to please dr kevin thank you thank you page 34 counselors item 1204 cta audit list and improvement committee the recommendation is a report item 1204 he received his information i have someone to move that way please let 's say the attachments are quite detailed when you go through them um and i 'd have some questions obviously maybe the secondary illustration what is the issue regarding the general ledger restructure project which is about a third of the way from the top on that page can ledger is it not considered appropriate by the audit committee through the chair the general legendary structure is just a huge restructure from what we 've previously had to what we 're moving towards as part of council 's consideration of the operational plan you 'll know that there was a lot of movement into spaces where it should be that was the first start of this project this over i think there 's over 3 000 general legend numbers that we 're trying to bring back to a to an acceptable level um with the with the transition of the cfo and the the director that has slowed that considerably because one of the projects that one of those people would have been working on was that so it 's something that we 've as has been installed while we 're re-recruiting and if i could madam mayor at the bottom of that page the risk appetite statements which obviously go further than financial risk are they going to be circulating accounts at some stage so we can have a look at that through the chair yesterday um i a third way it says councils engage with the council in victoria this in relation to the ems working party to review their rates module at the moment to ensure the product will be suitable so the am the this the open office um ems system obviously will operate our rates modules so that 's why we 're looking at this victorian council is that correct because i got it correct that 's that 's exactly right i think you need some comfort around raiding in that space because the other councils we were working with previously only used that module in the water space right and we wanted to make sure that that we had comfort around that module in an the victorian council was our go-to council too similar size or similar soldiers and if i could have with about two-thirds of the way down that page 45 mana man um the self-assessment tool what 's which self-assessment tool we talked about there was a self-assessment function on how we thought we were going and what we thought about the [Music] concept of what we were doing with all members did a survey and that went back in and the results of that um with self-assessment and that 's as discussed within this report okay and if i could madame there is a suggestion i think within this report that we may not continue with this obviously this joint auditing committee and that may segment it isn 't is that correct into lithgow for one and oberon for one um there 's a suggestion that the two councils are moving at a different pace or at different stages and that 's one of the reasons we would look to go you may have the same order there 's various suggestions i see for the next council to obviously come to a determination um we may have the same members but that we wouldn 't have a combined audit committee they 'd act maybe you could enlighten us on what the major differences are that have led to at least one of the audit committee members i can 't remember i know it 's um coming to that conclusion and there seems to be some agreement from other members to this um i 'll go back one the self-assessment tool was one that was provided by one of the independent auditors and it was pretty straightforward um can we assess them against what the terms of reference and we found that the performance of the audit committee overall was not fulfilling in terms of reference um lithgow had a different point of view and that 's fine um against different criteria before we work um the joint the joint meeting has never been actually particularly useful it 's never really got any legs if there 's any joint issues that need to be discussed well we can do that on a medium air or general managed general management basis but that 's unlikely the we are at different different places in the auto processors uh we 've been focusing on for example the ascending order and the road order and those sorts of things um whereas this guy 's been um and i think that come the new council one of the first things that needs to be led by the general manager i guess is looking at what now they are not necessarily not financial audits because financial earths are always done by the auditor general these are performance orders of boards or audits in particular areas such as cyber security or health and safety or whatever the one of the independent members is is uh deciding not to return next year and that 's fine that gives us a chance to give newcastle a chance to recruit a new independent member and at the moment we have three accounts that 's that means that everything is due to an accounting lens as opposed to a sometimes a performance lens that you want thanks okay thank you any other any other questions on this one counselors leave the recommendation all in favor page 46 counselors reports for decision item 1301 independent with the units update and review there 's a recommendation councillors in five parts but council note report item 1301 for information the council reaffirmed the independent rubric unit committee and developer terms of reference for the committee the council undertake a further review of the lease and contracting arrangements and prepare a standardized current lease document corporate services department within council the council developer project management and facility operational policy could i have a louver please councilman and the second guy thank you um well i 've read this report and obviously the recommendations with it um it seems to be reasonable but i do raise a couple of issues if i may and bottom of page 46 curtis street maintenance um council has now arranged for maintenance items to be rectified during lack of response from the i think it 's formed from the builder of the new units surely the builder is obliged under warranty obligations under its contract to do this did we not have a retention sum that we can claim on for doing this work we have a retention plan which is still with us to do this work right okay so we 'll use that retention to do it because the building has not been unresponsive very good um the current vacancy and maintenance updates um do we envisage that 's sorry above we 're in for balfour street about 7 8 the way down page 46 unit 7 um 's correct the next ones two of them if i could um do we have applicants in waiting for them once their carpet is installed and they 're clean but we have a list of them waiting so they 're ready to go as soon as two to three weeks thank you that 's what i thought um so um i wondered whether a further recommendation needed to be the compilation of the terms of reference which is referred to under governance at the top of page 47 or is that going to occur anyway it talks about reconstituting if i can put it that way the committee to run these units and then it talks about developing terms of reference i wonder whether that should be a further i can 't obviously ask for that to be added as i 've moved the motion but maybe some other council two alzheimer 's sorry yes right um under the lease and tenancy contract which is about halfway down residential tenancy agreement um i take it we have to use as the basis of that the standard new south wales residential we obliged to do that um through through the chair they are residential units units so yes there 's an obligation to from the from the from my understanding fair trading is the residential tenancy agreement because actually yes so all we can add to that is obviously you have your condition reports and you can add special conditions so i take it that the direction is going to be to ensure that the special conditions which may also include the car parking and other ancillary areas will be included with special conditions to that residential tennessee agreement the standard new south wales tendency through the chair for each of those who get a benefit out of those and at the facility rules and regulations will either be attached to the lease or be referenced in the tenancy agreement so that they are obliged to comply yes okay that 's fine i 'm just i want to make sure it all follows correctly i think i think from the investigation council it was clear that there was a number of different processes used to coordinate lease agreements and we 're understood that was the case but i just wanted to ensure that we ensure that we have appropriate special conditions attached um which may refer to everything from pets to you know carports to everything else and there is a specific reference to the facility rules and regulations um because if they 're not in the residential tenancy but they should be referenced in the the tenant has to comply with those okay um that 's fine i actually commit i commend this report because it seems reasonable to centralize the control and also to revitalize the independence change of natural process will resolve a whole range of problems always aggregating the authority under responsibility is a good move in any organisation um i know with some misgivings the public liabilities in this client for minor contractors and i think uh there needs to be more discussion about how to resolve that but i would expect that council has a risk-based approach for what what 's happening um and i 'm not saying they shouldn 't have public liability but twenty million dollars for someone who is a um you top have the potential to in fact need additional public liability but it 's those types of um issues that we 're facing that we need to resolve here thank you any other comment on this one transfers password mr mayor i thank that for the report um there 's a couple items that we need to consider that in the past there was never a bond required so we need to dribble say five dollars a month or something until get it up to a reasonable figure of a bond and possibly 300 to clean and they exit the thing if it 's not being claimed by themselves i 'm leaving what 's been missing on here is three months ago i think we wrote to the general manager asking me why um unit seven has been sitting there since december unoccupied and and was just getting through now so that 's a the loss of the community of over two thousand dollars through the chair that the issues have been raised are very much the ones that we 've just talked about here it is trying to find a delay in having that completed as a report outlined the whole purpose of coordinating it into one space is a way of trying to minimize those those issues moving forward but in terms of public liability one of the issues that we were having was around trying to get someone with 20 million worth of public liability to come in and do do works for us so they are the issues that we were facing during that time can we stop the rubbish and find out this unit was freshly painted out in prior to the last tenant moving in the last tenant spent half his time in hospital it was still freshly painted out what repairs were required there was already what so so was it only the taps to be changed and remember they 're independent living units not disabled units was it only the plumbing like this is what we haven 't been detailed to what were you what repairs were required that 's what i 'd like to know i don 't know how that 's going to change this recommendation counsellor going back it report i believe was why this unit had sitting there so long and i don 't accept the um definition from the general manager in respect of what repairs it doesn 't outline what repairs were required so he was tenanted before and before that tenant moved in went over the hospital it was freshly painted out i 'm sorry i just can 't understand why why the report wasn 't given it hang on we 're waiting on a plumber we 're waiting on somebody thank you councillor as a public thank does appear um large it 's not it is a standard figure normally asked of contractors i mean over on council insists i have 20 million public liability to put my stock on the road that 's one of the criteria i you know i have to have 20 million dollars to run andrew mckibben consulting it 's not an unusual figure [Music] to ask i realize it has become the accepted type of figure because the quadriplegic can get 16 million if cleaner leaves something on the floor someone slips over and ends up a quadriplegic any other comments counselors putting recommendations all in favor okay management of 24 crown reserves there 's a recommendation in six parts counsellors the council endorsed the dark operational draft overall plan of management for 24 crown reserves the council note the native title manager advice from cgn planning and development regarding the draft plan of management the council forward the draft plan of management to the minister for water property and housing for endorsement the pennsylvania general manager to make any minor typical typographical or editing amendments to the dark planet plan of management is required that council subject to endorsement by the minister place a draft plan of management on exhibition for a minimum of 42 days and that if no submissions are received forward to the minister for finalization or if submissions are received receive a further report of the outcomes of the public exhibition could i have a mover please counsel on the cuban and council of people thank you if you wish to speak to this council on the kebab i do madame um and i do have some comments and i do apologize that the document which is quite extensive and it was really um very hard to get through it all in the time frame because it was i don 't know how many phases it was i mean so obviously some were a lot of plans 200 pages um it is an extensive document and it deals with all our reserves in a lot of detail um there is quite a bit of repetition and obviously there 's the native title issues which are all looked at the back and because we 've um have been intervening acts it appears that none of our major reserves are subject to native ill pending subject to native title claims um on page 12 of the actual attachment um it 's a third to a half way down the stage with the bio diversity conservation act um which is correct however we then go on in the two paragraphs below and i believe the paragraph at two paragraphs which says certain weeds are also declared not just under the act that 's actually not correct those weeds are declared not just under the biosecurity act conservation act so i think there needs to be some a couple of changes there is the biosecurity act and we may be declared not just in part or all of the state that 's what the bias the whole synopsis of the biosecurity act is um not biodiversity conservation that 's right you 're confident okay i 'm pretty confident yes yeah we can get that checked but i 'm sure that 's the case because the only way we may be clear noxious in part of all the stages under the biosecurity act yeah okay thank you um just down again page 13 of the attachment all my references will be the attachment going forward do we have and i i wasn 't certain and maybe i 've missed it any areas of koala habitat within the outcrown reserves through the chair i would not like the same cabin [Music] of any at the moment um now one of the page 23 if i could matter man i just would comment that awareness of koala populations in our local government area is only just um developing it relies it 's much more widespread than we have yet the evidence to support so it 's difficult to answer that question about do we have any positive designated areas it 's just the information is not it 's very imperfect thank you absolutely in the bathroom at the regional council i mean we all know that a rocky mountain has koalas whenever i go to little road to new bridge just outside new bridge they push on the i suppose it 's about between wimbledon and new bridges i 've seen several koalas i think for example last night there were reports on beacon steel road right okay you 're still you 're still with you yeah so um one of the things i noted is that um although we 're allowed and this is page 23 uh down to the top other estate pom allows around the state for the provision of public utilities and works there seems to be an exclusion in relation to telecommunications facilities they 're not considered public utilities i noticed from somewhere else is that correct general manager that 's correct however they sit are still allowed to be constructed on crown conserves or what 's the score because i noticed there was an exclusion somewhere for communications um okay i just asked the question page 25 about two-thirds play the campbell 's river reserve um i thought it 's not part of that what we were seeking coming from that product across campbell 's river research and is that a permissible use of that crown reserve [Music] um a traveling stock route there which is unbelievable land services control uh not as part of this plan management but there 's also the senko 's hole which is further back yeah but is this does this crown reserve extend to where we were going to put the right because when i looked at location that that seemed to be that 's right um yes that is correct and certainly that was visited with local water services some time ago when council was looking to have the road realigned with the miscibility at the time of weapon service to do so so yes it does impact a um traveling stock route so there 's no we see um interest at report from the navy title manager who i 'm assuming is an employee of cln to prepare it 's been stated um okay thank you um to lose the recommendation thank you just yeah just through the chair by virtue of the public um exhibition of the document should cancel the form after reading through this document anymore please borrow me and bring those to us if they 're minor we can include them if they 're major then we can bring [Music] even through that exhibition process i encourage councils to have a look and supply their comments that way thank you people i didn 't um pick up the things that counseling people did i didn 't have any concerns i thought it was an excellent document um and and the recommendation is that we 're endorsing the thing to to go to the minister and then to go under onto exhibition um i hopped back to the um to the meeting so what back in august last year the on-site meetings and there was a particularly well one one of the identity was the presentation from the consultants was excellent and the the input from the labels was um also that way i thought and i think there was probably one in town and said i 'd pretend that so yeah i 'm happy to second it [Music] flat rock reserve down the mountain it falls on the classification of a park its ranges of uses i think highlighted on stages six eight four just checking to go wrong with all the glasses pulling up it 's outlined on page 51 as the actual business happens specify the uses available i 'll try 64.65 in the in the permissible uses is a camping ground primitive camping grounds similar to all camping down similar to uh the reef reserve and i was just going to ask i know there 's been a bit of reorganizing and the more we open up these areas to the community to use then the more careful we have to take care of it i 'm just wondering if there 's been any further progress in staff who will inspect these areas on a regular basis ensure supervision was a restructuring the general manager referred to in recent times i think it 's still in process i 'm just wondering how it might be going through you okay i 'm through the chair the the areas that you talk about are still managed by staff they clean up the air and they note the people that are there um i 'll also note that at this point in time flat rock is not a primitive campground it was not approval for it however and one of the amazing from this that i 've forgiven i wrote down the numbers but i 've somehow written down the wrong ones but within that part camping is an acceptable activity so should council lodge an application with itself for a park you can assume that concurrence from the plan of management from the crown if that goes through the minister 's process so the whole the whole issue about having a park there is it allows council to assume that the minister is also going to sign off under an assumed concurrence should an application be lost permissible use doesn 't an application and assume the minister 's landowner 's consent as part of that process so under what consent is it doing there through the chair it does not have a consent thank you very much um just to clarification that 's better general manager just said we do check all these areas um where 's our legal access to senko 's hull so how do we check it how do open public recreation reserve the comment the west and the east side some of the ground 's own freehold though in it correct good job yes 52 52 55 table 8 which refers to a park it does it does not appear to have camping and development to facilitate uses of that area but table 10 on page 54 specifically notes that the agronomy public recreation reserves or the reef reserve and flat rock camping um are targeted as camping development areas so that 's that 's the section i was referring to in my earlier comments whereas general manager informs me at the moment that camping at both those areas therefore is not acceptable at all there 's councilman elsewhere for you thank you i just have a question in relation to 50 of our actual agenda and business practices um about four lines from the top through uh explain what crown reserves the council manages as devolved land and it is managed under section 48 of the local government act its council is not the crown land manager can you explain what type of reserves that applies to and why it 's not considered that we 're not considered to be the crown man during those results do we have any through the chair i 'll have to look into the document unless my demo my understanding is means crown land that we don 't have any ownership or any right to have ownership we don 't have it we 're not the manager i don 't i don 't think that we do but i could take your notice and reply how does that differ from crown land which is owned by the crown and we manage because that 's the case with black springs all the other things that we don 't actually own it does this devolve land mean why is this different and because it 's council isn 't the creator manager i would think that but it says as council is not the crown member that is managed under section deserve the maximum crown reserves that council manages and then it says council is not the manager well how can you have the manager and not the manager so the plan management does not include yes crowd responders that council manages as devolved land and there 's management the section as council is not the crown land manager so we manage it but we 're not the crown landman so we have little to no rights over okay maybe the generation i think we need to take [Music] putting the recommendation in six parts all my favorite item 1303 development application 1 0 202 1.37.1 2 lot subdivision dwelling house and shared of 34 springfield street overall recommendation is in two parts the pennsylvania controls c.5.7 setbacks and c.5.5 building height planes on the subject side lot 22 in dp 124 3434 to allow reduced primary and secondary setbacks for the dwelling called in accordance with section 375a of the local government action 1993 can i have a murder place mccarthy can i have a second reflex okay thank you wish to speak to this council mccarthy it 's pretty straightforward it 's just it 's disappointing that you set these larger blocks away for a different use but unless you put a caveat on it you don 't get the someone 's smarter than the rest of us uh mccarthy i can 't see any reason for not to go ahead so one second now the comments on this one come from sponsored only um just receiving clarification of access to propose what they clarify to their director i 've had the same uh second that 's actually the second instance i think of significant disappointment in this project where um this was meant to be provisioned for i think a preschool available without spending plenty of room now of course it 's been carved up and sold and then on the other hand we were also enticed for the park which turned out to be a transmission station and a those things better but i think we need higher expectations of the developers and the plans that they put before us that when they say this is what it 's going to be then we ask for greater community asset and that it 's protected into the future both the community type assets here have proven to be completely false thank you and make sure that our expectations are met and uh we make it very clear what those expectations are and make sure that it 's part of the subjugation process i think you know i don 't think this actually makes i tend to agree with councils mccarthy don 't kill him on this but let 's both through you madam man how can we to the director of planning how can we ensure that what we believe the expectations are the expectations are at the time that the planning is actually approved originally um that we will achieve what we what is the intention rather than have this sort of situation occur that 's all that would obviously need to be considered at the um assessment stage as counselor counseling that doesn 't preclude someone lodging an application for something that 's permissible on the lead in accordance with the zoning provisions that mm-hmm with your lep that 's right so yeah so so the thing would be is that as part of that consent you would nearly have to do a planning proposal in your own right to preclude what you expect to go on that land and i don 't know whether anyone would do that so under under under under a planing legislation provision is very little cancer can do other than what 's available to them in terms of either approving or refusing an application that 's the direct tool yeah through the chair just a point of clarification with regards to the sewerage pump station that 's located in the open space provision is not an uncommon practice and i think in the stages of the springfield street development it 's the lowest point or land gradient it is the intent of future development which is permissible further to the south but that pump station will be removed at a later date currently exists as as has an approval um so that will ultimately disappear over time as will the stormwater detention base right next to that open space uh area that can be developed into a playground so uh in reference to the electricity pad mount station it is actually located in the road reserve that 's not actually in the open space and it 's obviously a facility that the utility provider must provide and i suppose without burdening what generally places it within the locality of an open space area whether that be unfortunate views of council law that 's certainly certainly a general practice of those utility providers hopefully that clarifies the position thank you any other comments on the council given just at the d.a space could us as councillors uh require a children 's playground there in that a lot but if we 'd have been you know a child care center or something but could we have stipulated that back there in the early days if uh or not because he was setting that aside for a children 's center or something if you know lot of young families coming into that area could we have requested a playground or a land set aside for park through through the cheer you did that council as one of the potential options for a bigger lot could have been for a facility such as that but there was never any application or never any approval for anything like that so i 'm saying we could not have required that made a decision then on the d.a and said that 's a requirement to put inside for children 's playground it may have happened but i mean you can 't_''_4142.64 do that through the chair only if an application for a children 's playground was applied for as part of that development and even so should an approval be issued there is nothing stopping someone else lodging another application on that land if it 's permissible on that one the other comments that come to us and thank you the actual development application these mixer requirements other than the setback but um council need to be conscious if we provide a lot out of black springs that we on the block councilman putting the recommendation counsellors all in favor page 1304 councilwood uh page 60 item 1304 the recommendation is oh the limits on service and communication policy and the recommendation is that council endorse the limits on service and communication policy 2131 as presented and i 'm happy to move this if i can find a second one i would like to speak to this um i know i am speaking in support of the recommendation i first note that most councils have a policy in place similar to the one proposed here the fact that overall council now feels it needs this proposed policy in place to protect staff staff resources and the ratepayer dollar is disappointing for me i feel this is a fair and balanced document setting out guidelines for both the community and staff in relation to the handling of complaints that are unable to be satisfactorily resolved under council 's existing complaints policy 2101 and a dose of common sense this proposed policy does not in any way appease the ability of the public to ask questions of counsel in relation to eight plus 8.14 to 8.25 it does not in any way impede the ability of the public to lodge a complaint against council which will be dealt with under policy 2101 section 6. rather this proposed policy supports policy 2101 section 6 and outlines options available should a complainant feel their complaints have not been dealt with appropriately please do not confuse not obtaining the desired result with not being dealt with appropriately these are two different things the general manager has the duty of care to protect staff and inappropriate vexatious attention from the public it is hard enough to attract professional qualified staff to regional areas the possibility that they may be subject to prolonged public vilification is not an option that should be tolerated the general manager also has a responsibility to ensure scant staff resources are utilized in the most efficient way to the benefit of the whole community this proposed policy gives the general manager the tools to ensure that in this instance these responsibilities are achieved again i stress every member of the public has the absolute right to question counsel express disagreement or there are clear guidelines for this process to occur so what is an issue here imagine a scenario where an estimated one hundred thousand dollars of rate payers dollars is spent over a period of time on staff resources researching answers to questions repeatedly submitted with the same intent seeking legal opinion and advice and defending the council position when complaints are escalated this money expended with no discernible results achieved or advantaged to the ratepayer it would be remiss of council not to put policies in place to limit this occurring in fact i think it would be demanded by a vast majority of our ratepayers this proposed policy no way impinges upon the rights of the ratepayers of oberon there are avenues in place to ensure concerns are heard and dealt with appropriately at all levels this is in fact strongly governed under the act this proposed policy is designed to specify clearly the avenues of redress should complain that still their complaints have not been heard appropriately it also clearly defines actions that will be taken by the general manager or a member of staff with delegated or defamatory there are adequate checks and balances in the policy to prevent misuse it is unfortunate that we require a policy such as this but i believe it needs to be there should it be necessary to implement i 'm speaking in support of the recommendation council pelham do you wish to speak thank you madame i also speak in support of the recommendation this proposed policy is not about limiting legitimate criticism of councillors or council staff criticism particularly constructive criticism is a pathway to improvement this policy is about proportionate responses to the abuse of people process and resources and is utterly consistent with similar similar documents in other lgas and has only two objectives provide some full protection for our staff and those and those limited number excuse me on those limited number of times that someone that they are helping becomes agitated or unable to control their anger and ensure that the right payer provided resources are not abused in dealing with complaints essentially it seeks to prevent the disproportionate use of rate payers resources in dealing with repeated versions of the same or similar prevent a repeat of the recent 2019 event where we had a legal bill of 24 000 which was incurred for an investigation of multiple unsubstantiated complaints leveled against a significant number of council staff the magnitude of the complaint by regulation required an independent investigation that investigation found that not a single complaint had any merit whatsoever those complaints had no outcome except that twenty four thousand dollars of ratepayers money was not available for unproductive uses the mayor has already outlined the disproportionate effects on rate pay provided resources and the extra hours worked by council staff and the version of those staff from their normal roles i believe that this policy provides a process to alleviate this disindulgent behaviour displayed by some at rate pays expense i do have made amir propose an amendment you can 't i would just like to say that uh if this council hasn 't had a uh a policy like this one before i 'm surprised and i would have thought that every organisation like this would need one i would you know sometimes i live in fairyland but i would have to be put into place because you know i would hope that we did we didn 't receive uh correspondence that could contain substantial inappropriate content or have callers on the phone that use inappropriate language such as from the music language i know as i say i might live in fairyland but we we do get those things occasionally we have to be able to to manage them and and i think this policy is something that we should have had before and um i 'm supporting it now any other comments counselor madame just through you can i just clarification for the decision-making steps taken for when this policy is brought into action because it says it you know says council may impose limits uh general manager may do this maybe that can i just have it clarified for me when and how this policy is brought into active role with any individual group who makes that decision where and how and where depending on what it is an abusive phone call but it gives the staff confidence to be able to know if they hang up they 've done it okay um that sense of director perhaps no no in that sense it 's anyone within the staff who receives a call where that may occur so it 's some protection around staff being abused on the telephone in terms of written correspondence it goes through a process and they 've outlined in this where that can occur but ultimately there is also a level where it needs to sit with the general manager in terms of the resources that we provide to going through a number of actions that otherwise this policy allows for some consistency over it allows us to have some um delegation to do with those matters that that uh that could potentially be unreasonable cost slumber i certainly support the the protection of um uh you know non-senior staff most particularly from abusive comments and particularly um our female staff youtube comments i think that 's is but it reads that the general manager provide a confidential report to council after any instance where this policy is used in relation to an individual or group this report is to comply with or wrongly we do take the power to limit some discussion and some input then um somewhere along the line that has to come out into the open before council in a confidential discussion so that we can be a check and balance in the use of that power i think that 's very important [Music] thank you speak to the amendment no thank you is there any comment counsel from the amendment counselors if there 's no comment i 'm going to put the amendment the recommendation now reads the council endorse the limits on service and communication policy 2131 as presented and that council and that 's the general manager provide a confidential report to council after any instance where this policy is used in relation to an individual or group further this report is to comply with privacy requirements within the local government councillors all in favor carried unanimously the amendment now becomes the motion all in favor of promotion [Music] page 65 councillors item 1305 returns disclosing interests recommendations excuse me is that council note requirement to lodge a return disclosing interests of councillors and designated thank you this is the requirement of the code so we have no alternative and it 's part of the general government so i 'd move thank you 71 councillors item 1306 count improvement fund there 's a recommendation in two parts the council adopts the amended ad valorem as outlined in report that council used sixty thousand dollars from unlike unallocated funds within the town improvement fund to make up the projects as resolved from the 2021-22 operational plan you 'll have a mover please consider pelham thank you and councilman um i 'm a little disappointed that we uh did not pick this error in the um rape 's determination up earlier and i am pleased that we did pick it up um but that we should have got this right in the first instance so i support the the amendments of the levy and also the allocation of the foregoing funds from the unallocated town of grip thank you councillor thank you madam i guess um i read this a couple of times to understand it but now that i understand where there was a discrepancy i and i 'm pleased to second this thank you any other comments here any other comments here councillors with the recommendation all in favor mary thank you page 72 councillors item 1307 development application 102020.88 modifier dwelling location the recommendations in two parts the counseling vary part b 14.12.9 dwelling setbacks and buffers of the overall development control plan 2001. associated da 10.2020.88.2 for a dwelling with a boundary setback of 35 meters from the northern boundary on lot five in dp one one nine four six three three being known as one zero two three o 'clock over on and that council that a division be called in accordance with section 375 a of the local government acts 1993 councilman mccarthy thank you our second duck councilman thank you how 's mccarthy do you wish to speak to this yes madam um the problem with these boxes i think from the grandfather from under the old original ido long before the early putting all that come into play it might have been developed while the lep was on but that 's the commandment we have um it pretty well the natives planted along the uh boundary there because i think myself honestly it 'll take the water with tannin but um if there 's some other way that they can just plant vegetation and lead to requirements because that area is very steep but yeah i 'm happy with the report i think it should be supported and i think with this subdivision original subdivision it won 't be the first requirement of varied things out there supposed directly any other comments on this one council our education how this came about which is not really evident in the development history um we this development development has been previous this building has been previously approved yes yes and this is a modification um why was the buffer issue not picked up in the previous or contrast with the can the developers proponents simply go ahead and build it where they wanted to build it through the chair well then thirdly this is in fact uh what we call a retrospective um retrospective modification is it not um through the chair the original application was approved 50 meters away from it was found that the best site was 35 meters away from the boundary which was outside the perimeters of the original consent yes which is why they 've lodged a modification as it sits now and and what 's all the formwork and steel and stuff that 's down there now that 's the new location was where they that 's where it is where they put 35 meters with spam before this cut through the chair the application was approved in a location the owner went through the process of preparing site for putting a slab on council did some their due diligence in terms of how they go down this path and they found that it was not within the enveloping which was originally approved thank you general manager i just i i support this and i think it 's quite reasonable i just was interested in the process by which we came around at this position because as you and i both know it 's there council hasn 't undertaken the any inspections on this until this is approved is there any adjustments in process or 've been improved in this situation at all or it 's occurred as in what naturally occurred this is modern era from council no no i don 't know well i suppose that 's part of the things i 'm wondering so you know really we this people 's um bacon is on the line in this decision isn 't it really planning and development should be advised that in the future we would expect the application for modification should be approved prior to them undertaking the work rather than a retrospective application once the work 's done through the chair i think that 's what 's happened i think that 's what council dhoni was getting at but i just think in this instance is probably the director of planning was to say that it has been approved but council states to you as a company who does a lot of planning and development work that you really in future we would expect this to be approved in advance of the slabs etc being laid comments united council thank you sorry general manager you have a problem with it you 're for council to do that when we 're not responsible for it we go out and inspect it let 's save the bacon old interim development order and i think one of the things is they don 't want to come down the hill any further because of going into uncompacted ground but and you know the relationship with the company but for building it they 're only probably using their license to facilitate the build because it 's a relationship thing there so you know i support it and i noticed that we 've got um close neighbors there and if you really go back on that that 's the house was the neighbours we 've actually built on the road reserves so there 's been a fundamental errors for probably 100 years so you know um i i honestly think this one meets the requirements the land is a poor quality that 's the idea of having a smaller setback and i think we should let it go ahead thank you councillor i 'm putting the recommendation counselors all in favor marriage unanimously thank you page recommendation is that council support the jewel naming of the fish river to include the traditional aboriginal name wombo can i have someone to move that live place council people but i have a second thank you counselor do you wish to speak to this council people thank you [Music] is [Music] taking the mask off trying to figure out what i 'm doing um i support this um and i actually raised it at um yeah colin meeting last night by zoom and which will receive strong support from the community group um there 's something council is addressing uh having lived for five years in a fairly multicultural society where there are multiple names multiple languages i found that particularly in new zealand where this is far far further advanced i support the recognition of indigenous culture where appropriate and i think it does is good so it has my support thank you so much any other comments from this one counselors recommendation or in favor okay road naming unnamed roads of titanium road the recommendation is that council endorse a new road name for each of the on the eastern side of oberon and i have a murder place council callum councilman kevin thank you mr kellen do you wish to speak to this uh i do choosing road names can be a tricky process uh as we 've all discovered over the last few years um i think the least controversial approach is actually to recognize those oberon residents who were killed in action uh during various wars and those names have been supplied by the rsl and they 're there on page 89 there are only 10 names remaining and i think choosing six of those is probably a fitting memorial to those particular individuals and their families thank you and i think we give people an option to make their own choice on those nights from that list if that 's acceptable before we do that thank you madam airways contentious issue um i suppose i asked the general manager we had a um a late submission um from mr o 'neal about the differences in spelling of o 'neill and also i think in relation to forest road um do you and i that problem with the geographical names board that they were um through the process o 'neill didn 't go through the checkout of the geographical names board however from the submission it indicated that um that the suggestion of a neural road has been used elsewhere but council are able to ask for an exception to allow the name so that is it 's not saying that it 's going to be supported the council can ask for an exception however the further into that is that if that is unacceptable or not possible the option of danny 's road is then asked for so there is an avenue for council to ask for an exception should they endorse o 'neill however it does not currently pass the requirements of the geographical names board when the name checker went through yeah um with i i 'm happy to follow the suggestion of the move of this motion in relation to using the um those people who died in defense the country um in part world wars um second paragraph on page 89 the selection of one two three four five would have to specifics the other comments before we counsel the domain uh madam mayor i in considering this also support uh councillor callum 's direction [Music] perhaps thought i don 't know whether it 's too trite but um we could uh draw the names from a hat from those from that list the other one that crossed my mind uh was if this is highland 's estate that we should use terms from the highlands so i did come up with another list of those that had support you know such as inverness sky moray apple cross in view to highlands estate give it names for the highlands of well-known places and thirdly um though i 'm not prepared for it i would give some consideration to perhaps including the indigenous term they do suggest in there you rally as i 'm not sure of the pronunciation um as one of the possible terms but today would be my three preferences that have been by the council suggestion terms from the highlands or some indigenous names the comments here comes with council givens yeah am a bit in legend out there that was actually killed here and crow 's right i i guess you can 't throw a name like that because he 's trying to take another thing but uh [Music] that 's how to kill her or not when you 're trying to come along and it 's just a bit of history that 's what i 'm thinking okay councillors we 've got to come to a decision here if no one 's got any further comment on counseling i 'd like to listen uh have they written up all the highland names if you could please yeah i 've got four now uh well in no particular order okay inverness skye firth of moray morae yes laurie applecross spot of particular beauty in view you should know i n v e r e w p which is a famous garden you can just the geographical names board are very clear around names that sound the same i 'm just concerned in to you might it 's just it 's not okay it 's just a comment um how many is that that 's five which is a famous cave but you 're probably not familiar with it so i 'll go elgin for the last of my six suggestions is that yellow it not be prudent if you 're going to go with highland names to have the main street in highland street or highland road one of those could easily be dropped off yes just thought yeah perhaps drop off sky which is a very that 's a well-known one it 's flogged to death pit maybe you could use that as highland pilot roadhole and drive maybe we could name the names after the good scotch whiskies so we start with uh jameson 's because that 's already won shitty glenn moran is this a serious city yes it is actually highlander state that 's the whole of whiskey you know my first choice i mean that 's degrading but the most defendable one is council of television okay can i have counselor madame here i 'd just like to suggest that we endorse all of those ten or whatever and let the developer give the developer the opportunity to choose from haven 't_''_6310.8 kicked him out completely the general manager does make a good point that road naming is the responsibility of council or not are developed right so we 're not dictating there is the only game so well counselors can i first get a show of hands on which list we 're going to look at are we going to look at building menu in action or people building action i 'll be going to look at highland names or are we going to look at highland streets i have to show all the developers um suggestions without which i 'm here and do deserve um consideration it is very difficult to get names through the names board of children 's names or adults names names in general um but we 've got now we 've got four options here councils what is your preference council mccarthy i 'll come first to you violent names of people veterans council island names followed by whiskeys [Music] veterans veterans not the whiskies but they 're not with highland road being road number one can i just double check this spelling somewhere to potentially put these names through the geographic remains checker before we lose and policed equipment is it going to be further or just more i think it needs to be just more right and can i suggest i think we agree with by the general manager i think number five is too close to number one oh sorry number two is it normal i don 't know i 'll get the spelling right first i am vdr u as in sheep is [Music] do we need to reserve one in case one 's knocked out and we 'll know that in a moment i think graphical names forward meeting as we speak i think the most efficient way to do it counselor while that 's been done would you like to give me the um the road type at the end of each of these what your preference would be i think highland must be has to be road um is quite relevant here hooray which sounds better all right inverness place we 've usable haven 't we nice close we haven 't used street we haven 't used last one drive [Music] um if this is taking too long we can pick a as councillor mckinnon suggested and alternate and four in case one gets rejected if you 're having trouble diminishing all right i think the nbu prize will be doubled up there 's only a short little on the list i 'm sorry the road types that were eligible yes it is avenue drive entrance road street that 's the road oh i see what you 're saying here number six [Music] um we 're just gonna go through foreign i already checked you highland 's acceptable [Music] for you at this point it 's fine but preparing my comment earlier if you submit them both and maybe one may be rejected so those six names aren 't acceptable yeah do you want to give me a reserve just in case you consider to be too close to inverness which is possibly the most probably the most beautiful place um all right is is if there 's no further discussion the recommended recommendation will now read the council endorse a new road name for each of the eastern side of oberon in highlands estate road one highland road road two inverness place road three more close road four up across court road [Music] elgin place with alternate suggestions ben nevis and alt bray ayl oh putting that recommendation counselors all in favor saying reports for information counselors item 1401 on page 94 monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please tell us the givens and a second to please counsel thank you councillor gibbons do you wish to speak to the report that 's a good reporter just a couple of questions you might be able to write what 's uh meeting again with transport in relation to trying to get a a pedestrian bridge across the fisheries council 's provided transport from new south wales some significant information that they 're going to use and it 's now back with them we 're meeting again i think um [Music] um great deal of movement in the sale of a of industrial land box and this is just one of the one have a look regional water strategies is something that dpi water are working towards trying to finalize this council 's aware water new south wales and also trying to put a regional water strategy together um this is just an update in regards to where each of those parties are up too okay thank you um report and i 'm pleased to say that the work health and safety 95 with the work being going to community hub i am assuming that we 're still on track to meet the current funds through the chair the only issue that we 've had at this point in time is covered restrictions and weathers being able to come on site because of where they 're located okay so that made a delay there may be some slippage there in terms of doing that but i 'll i 'll inform the council if that 's if there 's a significant buy but it 's all covered basin out of our control at this point in time thank you very much the next matter the next the risk management um thank you for the these events through through the chairwoman report august august meeting yep okay could that be noted please in the okay i note councillor gibbons comments in relation to pedestrian the fish river um i think in that matter we now have the support of bathurst council we 've always had the treasure okay and they 've been as active as us in pushing for it yep oh not quite they are on board they were very active originally when we originally brought this up years ago and they 've certainly sent a representative along to our latest meetings and they 're providing information so i think that their their hearts are in it that 's the fear of my counterpart bringing you tomorrow they 're not interested in paying for it though so um i just wonder if it should be raised with the um new layer of bathurst when you have your sit down with him uh it is being handled for staff at the moment but i certainly when i have my meeting with him it 'd be one of those well i have i write a comment we should we should be enjoying it but have been involved in these conversations that we have yeah with transport so everyone 's equally keen to see something happening thank you thank you thank you any other comments counselors on this one recommendation all in favor thank you 102 counselors item 1402 monthly activity report planning and development the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have a mover please council k4 [Music] um how the planning portal has been received by by people like when i first heard about it i thought there might be a lot of people who are putting in government plans who might have trouble doing it that way i 'll show the chair today councillor cable it 's uh it 's all been positive no negative feedback on the way um customers require assistance that provided that uh over the phone or or um provided them with information uh that the department plans invite to the board um so thank you madam mayor um yes i too was going to ask if the planning form been accepted and obviously we know so that they know it 's being done digitally now on that support um halfway down page 102 native dative title manager training um i also appreciate this this training is necessary i from the extensive work done in the attachment um i thought the view was that none of our properties were subject to native title so is this training enemy negativity through the chair council it 's a requirement under panel okay so that so that training 's required even if um making climate investigations you seem to indicate that none of our crown reserves are actually subject to that 's correct okay um that 's all i have for america i 'm happy to second the uh report thank you thank you council on any other comment please page 103 i don 't know whether it 's my reading or understanding just the second paragraph after the site inspection of the 14th of may a report with draft recommendation is to be presented to council or is presented to council messages sorry 23 103 yeah over on waste facility by the way 4809 second paragraph yeah agenda is to be presented has been presented 1409 translated page 107 item 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that the report item is received as information could i have a mover please counselor given to the second to place also capital thank you comes forgiveness do you wish to speak to the report yeah through the chairs actually a very good report detailed and very informative as you see as you work through good to see the blurry slips completed in norway yeah just impressed with the breakup of the roads that could be attacked when the weather gets well here on page 109 for a start how they 've broken up the sections where the roads weaken in some places and others and what work has to be done the sections have to be stabilized there 's probably only one section to stabilize on the road glaze mount road which is a solid road as we know that uh in their town there 's there 's work to be done there so you 're just real happy with it i think it 's probably the for me and you have to understand and see whether the trees have to be shifted you know where culver 's going in so very impressive thank you thank you councillor council capable yeah i just had a query for the director uh about how much uh the wet weather is likely to hold up the proceedings and particularly as i 've noticed as i 've been driving around the area how the the roads are being damaged there 's a little bit of a mess between you know black springs at times [Music] what weather is going to hold up to operations uh through the chair yeah certainly that 's our big concern with a weirder than average prediction for the rest of political uh what that brings well is expected to be higher average so um they 're a reality yes it is impacting our current project work out the road locks road and then there 's a couple others like that certainly uh weathering um so the extent of every traffic across it given the rainfall and snow and the like so um again we 're visibly of the game with starts on lowe 's mount road and into the road um understanding events or road money uh that has been already dedicated necessarily spent before december so advanced stormwater extensions and all additional comps are really the activity planned for closed mount road and uh season sort of coming pre-emptive road construction work and aside of course on loading up road is the uh removal of vegetation and advanced for that that work to proceed during the spring period as soon as the warm weather comes it goes along the gate six i was wondering whether we could make approach to the owner of the um flats on the other side of the board is that they can 't provide say another five or six metre setback you come out of the driveway those houses and the laneway that goes to the flats and the house further back and it 's there 's no city distance there at all and while we 're doing this work that we could possibly make an approach and see if they just provide that slight distance otherwise doesn 't have work done and i think now it 's time we should approach the owner of the flats and that and see if we can 't get a better setback in other words someone coming out of the driveway they 're sitting on that same the other one is um should we be approaching um the people along this 20 kilometer road to the end of the fish river and see if they wanted their driveway sealed while they 're doing this work which stops rubbishing that coming out onto the um roadway in other words loose gravel and that 's but from some random schools next uh through the chair but we do take those um measures with regard to sealing in and protecting the edge of the road asset by putting our provision in generally uh when the road sections are sealed so again this uh closed mount project which referral will be undertaken over three consecutive financial years as that progresses take that into account as the right words progress um thank you yes i agree [Music] just on the barrier slip which is the problem on page was with the adjacent land holder and the fence was decided to defer any repair of the fence until stock had been removed out of there i think my communication was pretty pleased with the aids and see what um through the chair um council staff as they repaired or made repairs uh did leo 's with the property owner uh indications were that probably i don 't seem satisfied to undertake fencing adjustments post the work so uh at this stage that 's uh the position that we 're obtaining uh if that 's not the case and certainly i 'm happy to hear from the landowner and that there 's an alternate to that outcome i just thought that the concept was at some stage the mud needed to be scraped back off the fence because the introduction the mud had slid down and pushed the fence into his paddock and he 's got a temporary electric pin so it may not have been appropriate he may not have wanted to do it because of the stock in the paddock but i i just wondered what the update view was that not to disturb the area is what the information i had received uh of concern of further material sliding further at that stage of the work and uh it was the intent uh to make their adjustments at a later date okay corporate services the recommendation is a report item is received information can i have a mover please councilman can i have a secondary counselor thank you council mckinnon you wish to speculate um thank you madam do we know when we will have clarification the enterprise management system and it was raised earlier i think by me will obviously meet our rate our rate module requirements we know that in the next month or have we already got confirmation that it 's from the victorian council that works satisfactorily and that we can move ahead on that part through the chair my understanding is is that the rates revenue office has already spoken to them um there 's only some minor things that she wanted further clarification on so we 'll be moving ahead with the transition so what what is the current time frame 12 months yes from about march yes so still let 's do it we still look at march 2022. i 'm hoping so we 're looking to remove ourselves from our current contract as soon as we possibly can and if i could through the other it projects which is in particular the email currently being hosted by civica which causes all the nightmare um yes but what um they 're slow in response and quite honestly um it 's difficult for councils as well and i 'm sure it 's quite more difficult to start do we have a time frame uh for that transition um they 'll be done at the same time so march 2020. if what we need to do is make sure that if we undertake something like this it 's done in a way that meets everybody 's needs and that is what we 're looking at here so to transfer over as part of the new ems system is probably ideal um however it 's something that we 're getting more and more clarification as days go by okay but for both of march 2022 that is eric that is our current expectation there is still the need for quite a significant consultation with staff and that 's very difficult on site at this point in time given the current restrictions that people are under but we 're looking to work out as much of the backup house as we possibly can to make that transition as easy as we possibly can right if there is ever such a word in these types of transitions so i can 't recall but is it in our action items that these both listed for completion by 2022. um through the chair now it 's not because it 's not a recommendation to council it 's a recommendation from operations thank you any other time in two councils recommendation all in favour thank you page 120 councillors item 1405 statement of investments recommendation is that council receives the reporter 's information can i have a mobile close council mccarthy and a secondary given council mccarthy do you wish to speak to this pretty straightforward i just noticed that we 're up six million dollars to what do with the sewer fund and for us yeah [Music] website any other comments counsellors i 'll put the recommendation or link over page 123 1406 grants monthly update the recommendation is that the report is received as information council human and a second to place that 's okay thank you thank you madam um yes i do um it was very pleasing to see that we received um the bushfire local economic recovery fund grant of 4 million 878 multi-purpose sports and community complex that 's referred to on page 123 um i note that together with the previous 2 million that 's now 6 million 878 000 roughly now i thought the total project cost was in the vicinity of 14 million and i know the comments made on page 125 halfway down uh where we see see we 're seeking building better regions fun r5 for 4.697 million the defending however not required is that actually the case are we actually with inclined contributions which i know are confidential um are we now in a position that we can complete this projecting for i would have thought general i 'm so through the chair my understanding and i 'm happy to clarify this later on however i don 't think that you can double dipping the funding from the same organizations so the reason why it wouldn 't be required is because we can 't accept all maybe we might be accepted of something for a grant that we 've already been given grant funding for so can i ask from our last this can come subsequently um from our overall position is there a delta or an undefended element still um i 'm having a common confidential that 's right that 's what i uh yeah okay i 'm happy with that so um subject to that i know there are a lot of quite a few grants attending um do you have any time frames as to whether the numbers of the march and june one should we have any ideas then they are likely to be decisions made i know that 's like looking at the crystal ball but sometimes governments make that they will make decisions by a certain date um through the at this point in time right have we sort of been obviously in relation to the sbt um have we had any information as to whether we may receive photography the recommendation is that report item is received for information can i have a merchandise council cable council given thank you transfer cable do you wish to speak to this madam mayor this is a good time to be through the chair as of last monday overall damn level was over 50 so with that in mind um there will be a a statement in in the review this week that water restriction will be removed even though it 's over 50 capacity any other comments on this one counselor i 'm putting the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 130 item 1408 monthly update status of council resolutions the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have someone to move that way please council mckinnon and the second elizabeth thank you thank you madam mayor um slight clarification relation to a few of these issues um page 132 i noticed this bottom it of the va application to the jrpp it 's been on public exhibition submissions closed 21st of june so where are we currently with that so through the chair there 's been some additional information that 's been requested sourcing that information as required from the assessing officer so do we have a date that we or a indicative date we think that we would get the va approved not at this point in time it 's still going running sources and page 133 second last item 32 15 12 20 which is the gravel pit exploration western side of the over on lga um this comment about discussions with owners has been there for some time where are we up to with those discussions i think the technical services director through the chair yeah certainly of a position with one of the owners and their uh their expectations that 's the uh um exploration of potential exploration uh we 're still pending information from the uh from a family consortium we 're going exploration so i hope you have a report to the august meeting to conclude that okay that all work is progressing according to the time table that 's probably not the case at the moment there has been some delay so that [Music] the so the for the bridges which is on page 136 137 the um the tenant options are still being prepared or have they been issued uh the chair the tender documents are being checked now for um clarity prior to posting this week so it 's the intent to have that tender up this week on the eprocure platform right [Music] so the the matter on page 138 which is the little roads environmentally effective picture i think we saw a very good report um but the last meeting that would be a further report to present enormous with the breakdown and possible funding sources is that the case through the chair that 's the intent to bring a report back to uh hopefully the august meeting indicating a way forward okay um in respect to the mata 100 page 141 third item from the bottom the over on common new shade awning um as a result of the further funding provided foundation um what 's the current status of the shade awnings through the chair uh the foundations have now been poured as in the concrete um alternatives to the original issues that we were experiencing with the the boring through basil which couldn 't occur just waiting for the footings to now cure subject of the winter weather with the intent to have the poles uh stood very shortly uh it is also the intent just fence off those particular foundations and try open the playground uh prior to uh the installation of the um and man thank you i 'm pleased to remove this yeah look um certainly i think it will be fitting to uh defense as it matures they 're not proposed to be payable no uh they look a bit out of killer off the stage with i think they look great yeah now they 're counselors the recommendation is that this report is received as information can i have somebody to move this place that 's on the cube can i have someone say council mccarthy nelson mckinnon do you wish to speak to this a is a report right i seem to i 'm not confused is that i think there 's a consultant doing a report that is going to be submitted to council in august 2021 i 'm assuming that 's for the august meeting um however if we go to halfway down 144 it says a timeline for completion of the office wc and town facilities the overall waste of it is intended to be completed during september so is that the timeline is going to be completed by september or we have the timeline and this works going to be completed by september if the quotes are currently being sourced i 'm assuming that the works the timeline 's been done do we have the timeline though sorry for the chair based on the the quotes coming back uh and the availability of the contractors it 's anticipated to be completed by any or by september so the office will be completed wc and the founder sylvester will be completed anticipated um so we have a we have sufficient funds to do this work as the next paragraph says a dollar for dollar basis yet to be determined and a need to complete the development therefore funds to complete the works would come out of the waste reserves originally anticipate so all the money is coming out of the waste reserve to do the work referred to in the paragraph above is that right that 's correct um the cell the next paragraph the cell is indeterminate as to when and and in august we 'll receive a report that will tell us when that new cell commits the next paragraph refers to a timeline program and schedule i 'm surprised that the timeline program was scheduled for improving the existing operation has not really provided as part of this report because that was one of the things that we 've asked in the resolution above a timeline for the point finalization of the installation so a and b we 're now saying is september c is indeterminate we 'll come back in in august and two a time loan we ask for timeline program but we haven 't got a timeline and program we 've just said that one through through the chair when this when this report was up there was a number of years that needed to be looked at asap so the so the worker was required was one that needed to be immediate so we have if we have a timeline program and schedule which the bottom paragraph of page 144 says we do um surely it should have been provided so that 's what the chair my understanding is is that that has been ongoing from the time that this report was provided to council back in february so a programmer works with prove that the site itself was immediate after that after that process but we we obviously there is a time that 's a program and a schedule shouldn 't that be provided through the chair the program is scheduled for fixing up the old tip absolutely yeah i 'm sorry it was immediate well this is how it will progress will be provided as part of this report august well it says have been ongoing since the notice of motion processes have been implemented for staff i mean i would have has been done by this date this has been done by this but this these will be these things can be done by these days that 's what i thought the purpose of the second item was um the solar power etcetera um i know i saw it somewhere but when 's that to be costing and timeless insulation of solar power supply powder over on waste depot shed um is there any update on that i thought i saw it somewhere but maybe not through the chair that 's uh part of the completion of works for the uh the office and the um the amenities in the county so we 're sorting quotes and that will form part of those so have we got a timeline for it couldn 't share again that would be anticipated in september okay so just going to the next page 145 um this independent consultant has been engaged he 's now provided draft recommendations and they deal with each of the headings below that are that are that are in the bullet points leachate barrier system etc but they 're in the almost is that correct through this year that 's correct okay so we expect um a further update in august that we 'll basically deal with all the issues again that we 've dealt with here plus providers for the consultant support is that how i 'm reading this let 's do the chair correct yes because at the moment [Music] apart from saying that the office wsan power facilities will be completed in september everything else is is um and apart from getting consultants reporting august i 'm a little unclear about the rest okay i 'll look forward to the all this before let 's say a final report photos and recommendations is anticipated to walk back to counselling organs at the bottom of yeah that 's all that yeah okay thank you mccarthy yeah i 'm a bit concerned that this with the solar power the vision i thought of the part of the whole facility because with our staff they have not operated boss and all that sort of thing out there i thought it all would have been rolled in as the complete office power of options that we have in regard to this this is to complete the first phase of this development should additional requirements be provided that 's what we 're looking at as well so yeah they might be split to start with but it 's the intention to have the provision of of what do we need so at the end of the day the report may come back that says we have mains power to the side that 's the problem you 've got three quotes to the power that 's never come back to council as far as i know you 've had people engaged in getting the power to the tip why isn 't that part of the report come back tonight it was always the intention of council to try and secure solar power for the amenities but that may be an option that 's not not viable we should be looking at other options so that 's what the that 's what this report will bring back last i was at the tip i thought one of your own senior employees was looking at getting all this but bewilders you to take so much effort to get something done that 's a lot getting out this thing should have been completed by the end of financial year and it shouldn 't be that we 're looking for other funds on dollar for dollar basis or whatever this should be a facility that abram can support itself but we 're playing games and this last lot of tenders for the power is the second look we had one from complete power connect before didn 't never come back through the chair just in turn our role as officers is trying to limit the costs to council and all sorts of things i think i 've said this a number of times council um indicated there they want to have this thing completed outside the perimeters of that that grant application and that 's what we 're looking to do okay i just think it 's a bit rough on our staff that they 're going to use their facilities as they go into a bloody gunning out there but i lost this one between the two just just one out of um well out of the scope of what we 're looking at just the landfill gas management and monitoring through you to the director is there we probably don 't have the mass but a number of tips spear their beds and actually has that through you to the directors that come up in any conversation whatsoever it could be hugely costly prohibitive i 'm just wondering well through the chair hasn 't come up with any conversation however obviously nothing it 's a heading of the future reporting thank page you item 14 10 waldara compliance with conditions of consent the recommendation is report item 1410 is received in information as information can i have someone to move that place how can i give them and i have a second diploma before we commence speaking about this report i 'll just take this opportunity to remind councils that this is a report for information only we are not assessing the modification application here this evening comment on the modification any comment on the modification could jeopardise the counselors and possibly counselors position when and you just keep that in mind that would be appreciated um thank you madame but we are not discussing the modification assessment at all as i understood this matter has come before council before in respect to one of the quantifications has it not but we 're not assessing modification this evening we 're this is a report for information if you have a question on the report it 's in public if you have a question on the report that will not jeopardize your position as a counselor should it come to council then you can ask those questions i would defer to the general manager as to why it would need to go in confidential this is his area um through the chair the way the notice of nation is that we provide a report to council based on that notice of motion it 's a compliance update on the conditions of consent to the existing maldara applications for the existing waldara approval so okay i 'm happy with that so if i look at the table form i understand that of the the da conditions as it not been complied with is four values that 's correct upgrade of borough 's crossing road which is item which is um 14 yeah and then there 's obviously there 's other amendments to conditions eight currently eight has been complied with it 's only that they 're seeking an amendment to that and the same i think applies in respect to 10 and it 's been complied with but they are seeking whereas to whereas 14 has not been complied with and they are seeking in fact i 'm making observations only you are totally correct that that 's correct so four day the others have been complied with the 14 hasn 't been comply okay and you just anticipated that at a future council meeting director of panic we 'll put a report in respect to these three modifications correct okay i 'm happy on that basis i um happy to move the recommendation thank you councilman thank you madame thanks for reporting um just a question to the director of technical services are we keeping a log on the amount of gravel and time we spend on repair report back to clear civil said that it 'd been gravel added to the road and it was strong in other words i know we do the maintenance and and that the gravelling on the road to keep the local people safe but are we putting the log on this uh through the chair certainly we have had to uh resurface the road with gravel given the natural wear and tear of that i think the observation from the player civil uh one that is not entirely correct uh certainly this is just a maintenance rambling on the road subject of this consent with the anticipated volume of traffic and the type of traffic is something that council really needs to consider however again as the condition says that there is still some extensive work in the engineering sort of component of this particular development which needs to be compliant with so the concern um would it be difficult to assess the amount of tuning where counseling parts is going to assess the amount of rate paid money that 's gone into uh the maintenance of this road thus idea would be just log and it could be just maintenance normal so we put 20 loads of gravel up over a period that might be whatever and everything but one of the applicants is opposing the thing that said that there was a b double coming out you know it 's not a b double root that would tear the road surface apart not even knock out bridgette and and they 've stated that it 's coming out of waldorf so what i 'm getting at is a bit different for the functions here but still coming out of the same product when we 're doing maintenance out there we need to just log it so we might be able to improve that money later on certainly for this year i 'm aware that we have reshooted the road i just you know in the conditions uh after um after the operator 15 and before which involves some roadworks safety upgrade reports commercial kit kitchen construction certificate the applicant has made extensive use of um private certification facilities we don 't normally have a lot of private certifying through balances um on um on private certification for privately certified work in other words do we random or spot check anything [Music] out of a list of numbers that have done the private certifiers i mean it is imploding in sydney as many predicted um do we have any check or balance ourselves we 'll go through the direction through the chair the council of the um the certifiers or as you know now registered certifiers are accredited by the department of fair trading now so they 're they are their accreditation body they undertake audience of the certifiers council 's role obviously is to ensure our cassette is complied with we don 't do any assessments on the certifiers taking assessments of the certified role i 'd say issue the occupation um they 're a registered certified so we take that on on place value that it is correct unless unless there 's a complaint during the works council becomes involved with that 's that 's it but through you madame so ensuring compliance is effectively mean that they do expect a piece of paper they give us back to say i say this is done and we simply take them back their professional word that 's correct and that um department of fair trading did you say this is responsible for it are you aware of any audits carried out by the department of fair trading in the over on lga on private certified work through the chair no i 'm not through the chair again there is a list of certifiers who have done the wrong thing on the department 's website but i 'm not aware of any uh that would come from this region through you again um professionally do you know of any circumstances in which um any level of government no necessarily local government has um spot sample certifies work as a as a policy have you come across that in your professional experience before three years so as i 've certified myself in a past life i was audited but only once in 17 years by by then was called the building professionals board which is now the part of the federal has morphed into the department of fair trading but the the now office of building commissioner yes i believe they they are undertaking audits of class two or residential flat buildings and taking to task uh developers and also asking certifiers to take a proactive role to be involved in the recommendation of any any non-compliances that they pick up so there are these all the reports it is alleged that that 's a complete change of strategy for them issuing defamation threats of actions so it 's said but my question is do you know of a all in favor thank you page 168 item 15 we have no matter for virgin business this 158 item 16 closed session and confidential report in accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government general regulation 2005 and the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kindness referred to in section 10 a bracket two of the act

i support the nation that is straightforward i 've read the comments and uh yeah it looks straightforward it 's councillor said we 'll do this all the time another comments on this one council don 't just made a legislation my own information thank you any other questions for comments i 'm going to put the recommendation all in back to the normal district council page the recommendation is that report item 0.901 is received as information come over please council [Music] that 's all i want to say a very a fine report in there thank you kevin um thank you madame um i was wondering if you the third item under meetings i on page seven if you could update us please on the forestry hub meeting um are there any more attendees for that is there a report on that later no i don 't usually present a request on that but i 'm happy to supply you with one or four okay i 'm just wondering i know that there will have been there are more attendees have they actually been members now um they did foreign submission to the um latest inquiry into the advisory activity which will be a big one i know there 's been quite a few uh purchases of rural land um if i could i noticed that you 've had various um correspondence with mr joshua forward of telstra and i certainly hope your approaches have been more successful been back and forth as to whether he 's going to attend in person if at all or whether he 's going to zoom and i noticed the last corresponds since the 21st of april and has there been any update or has he been as lacking in communication skills as he has been with me when he works for communications company well mr forward uh did suggest that he would like to do his own meeting with council council laws and i then went back to mr ford and said that that 's not the aim of what we 're trying to achieve here and that will prefer a face-to-face meeting and gave him some dates um and i haven 't heard back from him but i do have a draft on my computer at the moment ready to go back to him okay thank you um because i i 'm getting nowhere um and i 've got a list of about five people around the world um the i also noticed that throughout the correspondence there 's obviously a chain in relation to um the tarantula saw walls of page nine second items from the bottom it 's rates the top of page nine that you raised with paul tool and pool tool the local member is to conduct an urgent assessment um along that road is that correct um mr tool asked transport new south wales to conduct an assessment which they did and we have the outcomes of that assessment and there were some strategies put in place some have been uh actioned and some haven 't and i do believe the general manager has now been chasing that up with transport for new south wales and visco council so i maybe if gary 's the general manager 's got something to add or not um through the chair it 's just chasing up the actions that they indicated that it was a good idea given the short-term impact that that road is having on chasing those actions up yeah well i mean obviously um part of it 's been exacerbated by the situation in hampton but um it doesn 't go by a week that someone doesn 't mention it to me and i 'm be very much the danger of the safety issues um the other thing i was just halfway down page eight was the correspondence to samantha sin about illegal water harvesting um is a bit concerned that waldara may be taking more of an allocation as they are in time right and we are following as she is following that up with and we are also following that so that 's with the relevant department of water and has the matter down uh two thirds three quarters of the way down page nine meeting with dave schubert regarding proposed amendments to the um local government bill um and that is that is corresponding it 's fine so that there was nothing further than what you see here and you circulated you madame as um as the move has said uh council capable very active month any other comments um do you met in there page 14th of april um from allison snap i understand that you know two of the tapestries were taking longer but is there a finished time at the moment not at the moment as um this snap and more deterioration so it 's a it 's really as steady as you go we have had the grant extended and if necessary we will extend it again to get a good job done counselor on the 10th of may on page 10 um can you just elaborate a little bit on what the motion of this affordable country means about patient transport as you know or i have reported previously country mayors are focusing on five issues and one of them one of them is health and the executive were asked to perform from everybody 's all the mayor 's responses we formulated um or we consolidated issues put them into motions that will be passed and hopefully then go to local government research conference in november i particularly did one on patient transport because it 's a particular issue in this town um i can forward a copy of it if you 'd like me to yeah thank you the other comments or questions on this one councilmembers arguments justin correspondents i just live harriet correctional center they 're continuing every so often those graduation ceremonies are resume this month but with the fresh outbreak in sydney they um decided they would wait a bit longer and is luke how are you is he the superintendent no how we look how he looks after that gurney program any other questions counselors for the recommendation harry thank you many level counselors notices of motion item 10.01 rural roads environmentally affected there is a motion there that councils seek more internal funds to be used on unsealed roads that are environmentally affected like mount olive road dreeves road and many more this the author of this report was councillor mccarthy and i wonder if i could impose upon council mccarthy to have an alternate motion there to state that a report come back on those those rather than a decision made tonight yeah i 'm happy to have that um i tried to contact the director with ryan only to see what funds we can move into this pocket to try and do some more work we have an allocation of money but it 's not covering their works that need to be done i don 't have a so they haven 't identified where the money 's coming from the council provide a report on unsealed roads that are environmentally affected like mount olive road dreed 's road and many more would you be happy with that coming back we need to identify where we can get the money from when the report comes back okay shouldn 't report identify where the money can come from because it is your motion council but we couldn 't do that tonight in the report shouldn 't that identify where the money can come from and so we put a second dot point there counseling yeah that council identified where the money can come from the source of funding be identified or a possible source of funding if you 'd like to read that counseling having done can i get a second counseling counseling thinking don 't you want to speak to emotion counseling yes madam mayor um i had the pleasure today to get some people and drive this road and identify just on this one section of road that there 's 12 crossings short and a big one big mean the stand is getting washed away this is just one road that we traveled you can do many more in i 'm not sure other councils like andrew mckibben and that highlighted other roads there 's a lot of erosion we need to address this this road was graded apparently six weeks ago it was already back into disrepair so we when we 're a service provider we 're not a bank so we need to get out there and do some work thank [Music] motion support the motion however i think what we 're looking for is to identify within the short shine of necessary roads but sections of our unsealed road network which are costing costing a lot of money to continually maintain and that every time we get an environmental let 's call it storms that 's basically what does it causes damage to those and it would be all our interests to rectify in a way that we don 't have this continual recurrent maintenance issue and that we have a plan for those identified areas of particular roads to be rectified so i i i might in a minute so what i would like the report to do is to identify within our unsealed road network those specific areas which continually break down under storm damage and other environmental factors and then two to identify a plan for rectification of those because they can 't all be done in a year and three a a funding source over a number of years that we 'll then be able to um use to fix them so it may be additional pipes are required and now i may be getting a bit specific and maybe the report will come back with that without me having to foreshadow an amendment that was right but but what that is i think what we 're all looking for unless i 'm wrong for the last i think i think the proposal and the second direct to correct me if i 'm wrong right we have a lot of that information already we have an aesthetic survey of all arrows we know how many what percentage of roads are in poor position what and i agree with councilman mckibben we those poor roads and decide what we can do with the money we have available to make the to get them out of that poor condition into something better and in some cases that may involve stealing for example we 've solved a very caring problem on um unitil rate by putting in a kilometre of ceiling that 's and cold road and other roads but we 've got the plan there of what our roads look like we just need to get out of the vehicle just comments that they need to be prioritized i think you 'll find a steep grounded country it will be the first priority a lot of the level arrays who raise the diversion and contours they 're not having that 's a problem but you go to a bad section or eight degraded a lot and that 's unnecessary so i think why i don 't identify and prioritize the scope of urgency sorry mining section i agree with council kellum but i don 't think the ascetic mess i 'm incorrect i can 't remember it identified the roads but as council are actually not too bad whether on flat ground so we actually now need to go and identify the particular really bad sections and then if necessary the most council killers i think we 're all involved agreements [Music] but we have a budget to do something some of this work i forget what the exact amount is but we need more because what 's happening now what we 've allocated just isn 't covering any work so it might even be that we take a low interest loan you know i just think we 've got to do something because the time we spend going back and forward a little bit of money to be spent on drainage and maybe assuming sweet spots might outweigh the repetition of our staff going back doing repairs thank you um widening of blackboard road hazard growth the notion is that council used ten thousand dollars from section 94 rural roads to start widening of black bullock road hazel bro starting with trees on the eastern end stacking outside of road bird and using the event as a possible training exercise remover council when we 've had a couple of grants there was no indication that that money be spent on this road to widen it or improve the road birds we collect money from section 94 from developers to be specifically spent on rural roads so what i would like to see is spend this ten thousand dollars see where it gets us and then keep pushing along there too we get the road up to right right with i know it 's low in our metrics but that 's what we derive this money for money for section only for rural roads is to be spent on rural roads that 's the source carrying out this work thank yeah i just think if uh there 's something happen there and we can continue along that line it 's a close road to town and there 's a lot of bike riders so not too steep and it 's fairly level right around you can do the left outliers mountain black doors probably a better road just placed away related to a walking track and the reason there 's no grant funding tracks so that 's all odds so if council want to resolve this i 'm just making you aware of an existing resolution that you have i 'm in regard to a walking track now if this is too wide on the road and that 's what council means another comments on this one comes from councilman sorry i 'd say some clarification on this firstly i 'd ask the um technical services director what actually 10 000 will achieve number two um i suppose it asked three you had a man if it 's intended that the count the walking track would still go ahead if the road is wide second question number three um not having traveled black thought road recently um and noting the previous resolution that we passed at 10.01 how does grow and compare with the roads we were looking at there and also do we have uh information on usage i know it 's used by walkers and bike riders but how how often does it help you know what is the traffic on the road i know it um is down quite low all those issues in order we can make one you know that we can make an informed decision that information available tonight or will this have to come back to the further meeting um through this year but yeah if i take that on those bring back your further meeting but um ten thousand dollars certainly would make it a start no doubt to what extent i can 't answer that question right now so um being the case well how many kilometers [Music] um fixing up our roads but we 've been through this once before and there 's not a lot of clarity here about what we 're actually going to spend this money on and until that clarity is resolved achieved i think we should be looking at getting a report back and then making an informed decision on exactly what we 're trying to do and what money will be about can be involved for some justification within the matrixes that we have at our disposal um but through the council of gibbons basically had me enough of it but it 's a close road into and this is a small project people are talking about widening but the motion doesn 't actually meant that to start wide and that that that is therefore just the working on trees most of the work that appears for ten thousand dollars you wouldn 't get much more than a bit of tree removal um so i thoroughly support councillor kellum 's dedication to good process to make sure we 're always following the mattresses and that sort of stuff but sometimes i think it 's appropriate just to respond to uh this me so i i think i would support this motion as it stands to respond to that and even see how far we get any other comments on this because um thank you mayor um i am quite familiar with this road and i think i think it does get used um quite a bit by traffic i know i wouldn 't say that the walkers and bike riders give it heavy use but but it is a well-used grade it 's often very rough and steep um i 'd love to see it um better of that range better than they are i hesitate to support this because we 've already got in motion um that we 're looking for a grant and these things happen but it 's going to cost 75 or 80 thousand dollars and i would say that va at least that much um given the the topography of the area um i i think i think that is what we have to do and we have to have to stick to the plans that we have in place with our with our metrics our priorities is [Music] we don 't use section 94 for doing matrix work and this money sits there and it 's available we need to start on these roads other councils can put in things if they 've got roads that they consider that a priority but they don 't get off their ass so i 'm sorry i 've got something that i 'll put forward i feel that we 've got to start somewhere to do on the race i 've identified this one if they want to identify another one that 's fine section of road it 's very thin when you go through there with a car and you meet someone walking or a push bike out away it 's really narrow again if you need a car so we need to do something what 's the point of having money sitting in the bank when we 've got these things that need them thank you okay i 'd see clarification on the section 94 situation through the general manager i thought we were using section 94 on certain on certain roads and through the chair that 's exactly what we decided that 's right we call them 7-11 so at the moment to do that however all the roads within the local government area are applicable to the 7-eleven contributions so council on mccarthy 's right in terms of this money can we used it just needs to meet the nexus of what the contribution is all i 've indicated in my general managers notice that you currently have a resolution that says don 't do anything until you agree and i 've nominated the potential for you to do exactly uh on that road there was a pipe to go in on a bad corner and a bit of real line did that happen or not uh that 's halfway along backwards clear on exactly that resolution i 'll just ask so that 's made that safer you know the comments have enhancements sorry it 's confusing well there is a resolution emotion there that stands that we 're going to vote on if you 're not clear or you need a report i need an amendment if i don 't have an amendment i 'm putting emotion now i 'll move an amendment asking for a report no i don 't know that we need it we 've already had one yes that 's right and i 'm putting the motion as these housewives notion is that council will use ten thousand dollars from section 94 rural rose to start widening of black bullock road hazelgrove starting with trees on the eastern end stacking outside of road verge and using the event as a possible training exercise all in favor two three one two three four five against two item 1303 1003 sorry business case land at india avenue the motion is the council do a business case slash report on using land it owns on windy avenue overall that is vaping to do a possible duplex that could be utilized for staff accommodation i wonder council mccarthy as the proposal of this motion i could suggest an alternative motion for your consideration i 'm happy mr madame i 've been shot down three times in the past um i wish sometimes i 'll bring up the duck girl and die and move her to get these things started but i 'm happy to get something started i suggest this goes back to when councillor dawson is understanding and i suggest that council produce a report in relation to possible usage of land owned by council in glendale avenue overall it 's an asset that shouldn 't be sold at the moment i don 't think there 's any plan to someone okay well it might be that the council will come back with a report to say just purely and you have the opportunity okay all right well you sure counselling yeah just do i have you i 'll have a second doctor the comment by the general manager um through the chair one of those options would be to sell it so that will come to council to consider council mccarthy you want to speak to the motion uh haven 't you changed do you want spectrum oh you can 't read it yes the council produced a report in relation to possible use of land owned by council in glendale avenue over on now you you 've changed it so you 'd like to move my question was would you consider all right i 'll consider it okay are you happy to post that motion okay and we have a secondary council of people because mccarthy you can now we should you know we should speak to the foundation and i think it is a block of ground that um is um uh suitable yeah ideally situated and i think that uh this is an ideal time with what 's going on in the community to mccarthy that uh that we look at building something there that decision thank you councilmember thank you very much all i want to ensure is that within this resolution that i 'm sorry within this report um that the option that 's suggested by councilman mccarthy is included because the report could come back not even mentioning uh possible staff accommodation or a duplex so it may be appropriate if i foreshadow an amendment to put over on including but not limited to colon a possible construction of staff accommodations on the site semicolon b sale of the property three other potential uses so i propose that amendment just to make sure that we do consider what council mccarthy with us is one of the options if that if you don 't think that 's necessary then and it 's in the grid between the lines okay i 'm happy with that in front of you madam mayor that would be probably the crux of what a report would come back as in its current form without the need for those things i made the comment that if a report come back on land users it would say whether medium in goldstar to say how many you can put on there based on your current plans and policies so you might go a bit further than that okay i 'm happy if we don 't if we don 't need to say that but i just want to ensure that we don 't get a report back that actually doesn 't look at the specific issues i think in the spirit of council mccarthy 's nation that will be all right i 'm happy with it is there any other comment here yes madame we need a date on it by the report you know the date yeah we 'll come back and that will go in the action list that date which is next what do you think county council meeting 16th of april 2021. can i have a movie please counselor kevin thank you secretary councillor thank you councilman kevin do you wish to speak to your report thank you madam mayor i think the report uh basically uh speaks for itself i can update the council on the fact that together with um the acting general manager did attend macintosh affiliating with discuss um potential legal action against those land holders to which we had received at least two penalty notices we 're obtaining legal advice in june with the idea of going to speak to the local member uh concerning how the recording is meant to fund legal action against potential owners who just ignore or fail to observe penalty notices we 've also wanted to know what our rights of action are in respect to selling land we do not have the same rights as a council does for unpaid rates to sell up land but we have certain rights to put canadians over the land so that if there is a sale in the future but as we all know there are a number of properties that um remain with um families and inter-generational for a long period of time so that has limited effect um we have got a some pricing for what potential it would cost to bring an action and we are looking at various various avenues at the moment we are intending to meet with the local member in mid-june from what 's in my report as you can see the number of penalty notices has been increasing which on one instance is good and other instances are not because we you know obviously voluntary compliance is the desired outcome um we have had quite a number of backup big backlog of second inspection inspections that is clearing itself gradually i understand um but there are i think in our meeting with some 500 of inspections to be conducted second inspection perhaps i 'm gonna have to lift my game if i need to be if i want to be noticed um i think it was a previous one i do apologize to counselors i did leave madame uh partway through the um workshop that i was on um yeah very comprehensive report from my colleague and uh just one thing that council is finding it takes a lot of time these penalty things are taking a lot of time and hence as councilman gibbons said uh a big backlog in the inspections [Music] and that is coming uh about uh to a large extent through the time taken with uh to use a cross denies a dotted and all that sort [Music] uh can i after my report be amended or calling me tonight council dog was there and i think i must have taken it from my previous uh so my sincerest and note my sincerest apologies they have an actual photograph of that noodle grass and it gives you an idea what you 're looking for they tell me it 's on the other side of like wale and all i know when i go out there is umbrella grass up against the fence but two web assures me that it 's full of it there shouldn 't we be proactive and having a photograph of what we 're looking for this actual item like they haven 't care on the way in the carer that it has on the side of the road with the snoodle grass the photograph is an african love grass for children maybe we can um through the our delegates ask that that being brought up at the next up in the quarry county council meeting sorry sorry we have had a love grass which is around lake long and there is chili in there for us both um but both noxious please sorry the weeds of the priority weeks i can assure council mccarthy that chilean needle grass it 's very hard to identify except when it 's in the sea and i have to end down on my knees which is rare and you have to feel the bottom fronds of it sometimes to distinguish it from a spot to see if it 's got nodules on it and i have had the lls person identify some and i can assure you they missed half it is really really hard to identify this chilean demographics the only time you really a normal person will be able to identify it was when it was seen it 's got quite a distinctive front i mean we 're getting into details um but it is not easy to distinguish from a fescue or a or a copper in particular they 're very similar it is very similar as chilean castle mccarthy are you talking about general signage of general wheeze or specific it that they 're concerned about it yeah they have a colorful sign on there to the road right this is this is a invasive weed or something and it 's proactive we can 't all attend these field days and that and a lot of it might stand from a little hobby farm there 's not known what it is but if he sees it if there 's a sign he becomes a little bit more aware of it [Music] oh um just a quick question i i noticed the discussion that the budget objective is a small surplus on a regular basis on an ongoing basis and then i noticed that the 26 thousand dollar penalty infringement notices i was just wondering what proportion of those default managers um just out of interest uh we 've got there 's about 50 of them some are being challenged um so that 's about it um um we 're certainly not going to build up and we have resolved to put that money aside for potential litigation it 's not going to fund the sufficient you know it 's not going there 's no other questions i 'm putting a recommendation all in favor thank 1102 oberon business and tourism association 14th of april 2021 the recommendation used report item is received as information can i have a mover please that 's the case any other put the questions all in further harry thank you page 19. committee reports item 1201 blackstone 's community hall committee meeting there 's a recommendation in two parts that council received the reporter 's information and that council will note the recommendation of the black springs law committee and defer any recommendation that any black springs community association event is free of charge at the black springs hall the consideration through the implementation of the 2021-22 operational plan gonna have a mover please councillor cable and the secretary has forgiven thank you councillor cable do you wish to speak commission court uh you 're thinking there um the recommendation is um straightforward and i think that is the right way to deal with that request other than that this was from a fair while ago so um i don 't think there 's anything that um thank you for all um chair in relation to the long-term plan and um trying to get some ideas from the community as to what the long-term usage of the hall could be and some ideas as to what we should be moving ahead because we really need the hall used especially as we spent some money on it and looked like spending some more money on it maybe i could ask councillor kate because i know he took some notes as to what what the potential ideas were because that 's a crucial importance of this council continuing for future grants for future funding very difficult to keep up with the ideas that kept coming in but i think they most of the ideas that did come in uh were along the lines of organised functions council mckibben might have organised it and then suggested he hasn 't organized it yet a bns or something like that most the suggestions were along the lines of social activities of all different kinds there wasn 't really anything very uh concrete came out of it i didn 't think it things when you just um open up the doors but you 'd have to know that if it 's coming back through the 2122 operational claim consideration it will have to come in the next couple of weeks through the chair we will bring back within the report the suggestion that any community event and we will allocate the reduced funding in the in the operational plan accordingly if that was the case i think i think the um anything that happens out there will have to be organized by that community rather than the committee or anybody else and i think what i was hoping you might have come out of it was that the the local community might have got some good ideas themselves and that and followed up on them and they might the communities use out theirs this is for the future and it 's an older generation 15 minutes from abroad it 's in the center of our shire i think it 's up to the council who are the trustees maybe to have considered things out there as well but what i 'm saying think there 'll be too many functions there because you cannot i couldn 't hear don caple the other night and you 're sitting next to him it 's very bad i know the community puts money towards it i think it 's up to this council to support that idea you can 't go ahead with lots of ideas if you can 't provide a community hall where people can talk in here and music 's a big thing that they 'd like to happen they 're just getting the local community together but as it is i need the support of council even if progress goes hard or even if there 's village fund money goes there there must be some funds here to fix that law i think we 've expanded substantial funds also those counsellors have been grant funds everyone has been grant funds and the community association and grand funds are going everywhere and if we say just the acoustics of the crook in that hall just hear what we 're saying and see if we can do something about it and then we may i say it 's a community out there that has some fairly lonely people out there that could give us the opportunity to bring them together for a sunday evening it is getting used in different ways than other schools using their other years but it 's not just the black spring community it might have been when we had eight children going to school there it 's twelve children going to school so let 's think a bit bigger than that uh cancer the trustees the money that 's spent being spent there 's been three grants and that 's fine that 's what we have counsellors for the grant money 's been going in every other direction fifty percent of the people lived in neighbourhood five or six percent use the centers over there the swimming you know there 's a lot more people about that may use the hall if the opportunity is there and it 's not a big cost and i 'm sure the association will come to the party as well thank you thank you councillors just going on from my previous previous two was with i think with oberon working with bathurst in relation to obviously the b2b bike race does not go through planing it 's a bathist only race like then it 's quite a lot of people we know brainy used to put in quite a large contribution i think that the reason maybe they caught blood of it whether there 's an opportunity for obama to do anything or whether it ends up being obviously too expensive to contribute but we thought it was worth investigating that was one thing that did come out of the meeting well i 'm assuming if we could bring these things back the other thing was there used to be a i think it was a cumin tang jazz festival in the forest found below black springs tutors here years ago because i remember going um and that was cow monk sorry tank was the nationalists in china sorry something similar to that you know it could be used for that that used to be in the forest to do that in someone you know minded to do that but that used to or music festival for a weekend in the forest and it was in the vicinity of black springs so there 's no reason the hall couldn 't be used as part of that type of event but it obviously needs someone to have the motivation to get up and going again but i don 't know how many people council do tourism and economic development officers to maybe re-look at that as something that could bring benefit to the uh as part of our forest you know forage festival or something but yes i i that night that was another thing i 'm just thinking of a couple of things that did come up but the recommendation 's a lot simpler than that and that is that any event that the black springs community association want to want to put on they can have the whole free of charge that 's that 's what come out of the report so yeah the things that that black spring community association want to do is not for council to to get involved with at this point in time it 'll be purely for free if and when a black springs community association event is coming up at all because the fees and charges you charge proof i understand that there 's nothing else on this one i 'm putting a recommendation all in favor item 1301 related party disclosure policy review recommendation is the council approved the related parties disclosure policy and i 'm happy with it thank you policy needs to be reviewed annually and we 're doing that now and i agree with councilman thank you any other comments counsellors put the recommendation all in fact thank you oh recommendation into parts is the castle very part c.6.4 carports and garages of its current dcp 2001 associated to the development application 102021.24.1 for construction of a garage at rod 11 in gp770496 being known as 36 karana road oberon at a division recalled in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993 and leaderplates council capable and council of people thank you people would you wish to speak to the front uh not thank madam mayor but thank you all i 'm happy to to propose the motion 'm happy to go along with uh i 've read the comments along with the recommendations um yeah i 'm happy to support it [Music] before this was when this was written there was no um no submissions from any of the neighbours but uh there was still time for some to come in i just wanted to have there be any i 'm happy with the report but in the um director give us an indication can you go straight through the grains i didn 't think you could it says that they want to get cars off the street [Music] and uh can you go through the ground sort of front roller door to the taron arrows page 36 so we just face the plane house down to the back is the drainage it does show a space between next to the house i 'm happy with the report but i thought it said somewhere that they want to get the cars off the street because they have some parked in their driveway and they 're currently parked at the front of the property yes so didn 't 'm sorry [Music] storing some furniture in the garage at the moment so that would be moved to the ship therefore they 've got space in the garage to get the car straight into the garage page 40. counselors item 1304 road naming unnamed roads highlander state recommendation is there in two parts the council proceed with an advertisement to be placed in the overall review seeking written submissions for the naming of six new bitumen rows that are part of the new subdivision known as highlands estate part two that come at the conclusion of the 30-day exhibition period a further report to council will be presented compiling all received names submissions for its consideration determination and endorsement can i have another please thank you hello my counselor thank you councillor kellum do you wish to speak to somebody correctly this is a ministry process but i look forward to seeing what names come back and can i ask the general manager what sort of vetting process will happen before they get the case through that share the geographical names board have a number of processes that you need any with potentially vulgar requirement or outcomes associated with that might be supplied to councillors or those that aren 't unfit for publication [Music] or duplicates first and second names we will provide the geographical names board requirements as part of our report packages yeah the comments because the people oh no no nothing so madame eric said that i 'm looking forward to the meeting that when we decide on the names and i hope there 's not too much other business that night councilman madame as this is called the highlands estate one would assume that it has to have scottish names from the scottish highlands it can 't_''_3951.119 be lowland names so that 's what we would assume should say should we make that a prerequisite that it should have scottish names from the highlands i seem to think when i come on council there was a bit of a requirement to look at the service of the um people that served in our war and that went to war was one of the three requirements to look at so i hope we take that on board load of rubbish in respect that when we suggested graham drive out here at the state of kings estate we were told we couldn 't use it because there was one grain drive in backers now how does that sit or are we do they know something that we don 't know are we getting ready for a malformation how do they say that we can 't use grand drive which was suggested out here it it 's only relevant if you live in base there 's another hole well unfortunately that perspective the criteria that the geographical names board put on it is nothing to do with us we have to adhere to them so do they know something we don 't know i 'll put the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 22 item 13.5 report on provision of turbine gutter print street the recommendation is there that council include the proposed urban gutter works in prince street over on within the curb and go to capital works program for 2021-22 the council in principle endorsed the 100 000 allocation in the 2021-22 town improvement fund and w streets i have a moving place councilman given in a second a council thank you do you wish to speak to this councilman um thank you madam ma 'am in the circumstances it looks fair and reasonable my only concern was in the second last paragraph on page 43 so the current risk is the contribution from land holders is not forthcoming should this be the case council will be in a position to modify the chromium program and report this back to a future council meeting so at what stage will we know whether land hold owners are going to be forthcoming with their contribution i 'm through the chair as part of our process what we generally do is notify the the landowners we generally know reasonably quickly whether there is a problem in that space because we received quite either positive or negative responses to that request so that will give us an initial indication on whether that 's going to be a problem under the roads act we have the the um we have the right to be able to ask for 50 and in a position to give you absolute guarantees we will know reasonably quickly if it was to be supported or not and from the perspective of the houses in prince street we already have that commitment in writing from the three houses that they will or are happy to contribute 50 percent right okay well i think it 's fair and reasonable um i 'm happy to support the motion i agree with um just given about the risk of the contributions from the other passionate people in print street but i think we do reasonably well on the contributions turning up mostly although i know there are some that uh stage time so there is a risk there is a risk account to where there 's some money but i think it 's manageable and probably not as much as i 'm not forgetting there is a hard hardship policy yes should this be onerous the other comments come from with the recommendation thank you this 44 item 1306 quarterly budget review statements january to march 2021 there 's a recommendation in four parts the council received the report of 123 896 made to the developer contribution that council approve a water fund adjustment to reduce the capital works budget by 300 000 and that council approve a sewer fund adjustment to reduce the capital works budget of three million dollars can i have a mover please answer callum thank you and justin 's given do you wish to speak to this yes um quarterly budget review statements are often volatile and this one is in particular volatile with a 1.7 million dollar deficit um i 've spent some time talking to the general manager and others about this and i 'm reasonably satisfied that uh most that will be made up when we receive the natural disaster repairs money which is 1.6 million dollars naturally when you have a natural disaster of any form you need to fix it quickly as you can and so it 's one of those times when you do the work and on the promise the money will turn up um and there is also some more money due from uh the safety productivity program which will more than cover that 1.7 million government won 't produce the money at the right time and um however that 's the risk every council runs every time well managed here and it 's fine the three other items that is the the general fund the adjustment there is for an increase in developed contributions and that 's a restricted fund along with most of the other ones and all the sewer fund as well so i supported the recommendations and look forward to the end of financial year report until that deficit actually or circles in fact um thank you madame i um i too looked at this and dead island assumed it would write itself as we get closer to the 30th of june um i would ask maybe whether orally or in writing we might have an update after june meeting as to how we 're going in respect to have we received the safety productivity program funding and the national disaster funding at that stage i think our meeting in june 's the eighth is it what day it is the 15th of june um but it would be good to have 're going it doesn 't need to be in writing but at least an old one at the meeting yep so we can throw it through the chair i think it 's probably good to have a written written report if i could all right but just so that we know where we 're aiming for and likely to get to it the 30th of june so we have enough so subject to that i um yes i 'm happy to second this report thank you council any other comments or questions on this one the recommendation will in fact is married page 49 counselors item 1401 reports for information once you 've activated the report general manager the recommendation is the report is accepted for information can i have a mover place that 's nice mccarthy council darmian thank you councilman it 's pretty straightforward of all the operations that we 've done the last month my only query is um we have an executive team leading on a monday morning i mean um did we view the um ct footage down the state park when we had the someone that can be prosecuted we have ctvs down there and [Music] so the other cameras there is only one okay looks like the trial is no good so what i 'm getting at is that and that was the council resolution when we trial the cameras down the state park if it 's not working we either need more or we need better cameras through the chair this is a new path like the um where the toilet was is a new location and it may need additional cameras happy to bring back that to the common working party for consideration i understand that but in this particular case we know when the concrete was poured we know it was gone off so it was probably a four or five hour window after and it wasn 't set so somewhere in that time frame you 're telling me it didn 't that 's fine but then we need better cameras um safety um just seems to be incidents accidents reported sex first aid injuries two medical treatment recoveries one no lost time that seems to be a bit of that we 're under but uh i just i suppose i 'm looking for some assurance that whatever those events are that a the person is going to make well people are going to make full recovery the second that we uh they 're things that we can uh avoid in the future so through the chair there was no lost time injuries so that gives you some indication on the nature of the incidents or the accidents right as part of you as part of this month there was quite substantial work being undertaken and some incidents were received um there was a garbage truck there was a one of our rollers hit one of our utes there was a number of mine there 's a couple of modern incidents thank you um page 52 just under recruitment i thought we were still doing something at the waist stepper the picture of the solution through the chair there 's still an interim solution we 're working on trying to provide a permanent one it 's a little bit more difficult so there 's no original position advertised here no of that position is still in progress okay it 's um through the chair just to give it some background is that the current operational errors for the tip don 't necessarily meet the requirements of a 35 hour a week position sure so i 've asked the planning planning director and the technical services director to put their heads together to come out with a way of how that can progress and that means that we need to re-look at the hours operation for the for the tip especially during monday to friday that might be an answer but in saying that with outlined that as one of the things that we will be looking at during 2122 operational plan and anything like that would be reported back to council for their consideration now i don 't know this is operational so this is only discretion i 'm assuming it 's operational so it 's only discretion but yeah our old tip worker used to do work on the tip outside those hours so we 're talking about providing work off the waste depot my apologies other than the jobs or we 'll just go through through the chair we 're not trying we 're in fact trying to create positions okay we want a standalone position at the main field but that then means that there will be a time when people entering the site if you 're doing capping or anything like that you don 't need them there so the hours of operation may need to be varied to support or health and safety requirements to start with but the last thing you want to be doing is put a compactor over a car so they are the things that we continue to work on bottom of page 52 training services new south wales i 'm not familiar with the term is that is that a new term to take or is that a private body or um they 're a [Music] or sorry improved qualification facilities for people in the town without having to leave the town we 've ran at it a few times but we haven 't had a lot of success is there any reason why this might be different um through them to us that 's what rather than rather than doing it the other way send people so it 's a more localized and more and a smaller type education and training center through you better and that that 's exactly what we 've been trying to achieve principally to that hasn 't been successful okay thanks very much um and just on um 54 [Music] could you just give me a little bit of detail on 15th of april meeting with property owner regarding planning matter [Music] locations i have so many i don 't know whether it 's our council feels about it but uh the director nominates exactly who he 's talking to with each meeting i found that quite useful um a meeting with an eliminator who wanted to remove the kd off their property landowner not developer [Music] community funding and other grant projects so these projects that we already have i think there 's another round of strongly community country communities coming up so was this a retrospective for looking forward through the chairs looking forward as well as trying to seek some idea very question any other comments uh just a brief comment madam mayor um from the tourism and economic development activities last week 's um opter meeting um which the general manager and i attended the general manager gave a rundown on the data project with carlos um brought about a glimmer of enthusiasm from opto members i think there was a number of the people that were there particularly the business people who could see great um potential promise in uh having the information available to them that this program is going to give them i think i think it 's a great initiative and i hope that it gets the use that the enthusiasm displayed the other night indicated that it might get nothing to be that 's pretty exciting that 's one of the things that i think um council oberon is benefiting greatly from council 's decision to employ a tourism and economic development person and i think every every time i go to another meeting and see the things that are being organized by out of that office i think uh it was a very very three minute man so i 'm assuming the signing strategy and implementation apart from the uh damage that subjects the insurance plan has now been completed through the chair yes it has been almost complete it says in the report but i 'm assuming that if you don 't uh the open pool and fitness facility um management agreement um the assessment of the kpis is annually or six months um right that agreement 's been signed as you um i was going to ask about the whs issues but council knows with that recruitment i heard a rumor that we had lost an animal control officer is that correct that 's correct we will be advertising for new animal control um it 's not in the um further report up that where we look at the the status of issues but um have we had any update on the stp other than from where we were last time through the chair gary styles is in fact in today and spoke to chris about a number of things stp he 's constantly ringing and pushing our case with the state will be provided for and we 're working to that schedule june is to just clarify june is the time where we 've provided formulation to finance friends yes and but we still although they 've given us the nod and the wink and everything else they haven 't actually given us a letter saying it would be nice to have a letter that still reminds me that it 's all fully satisfied the conditions and we fully support the plan as as presented and planned we have all the positive words we don 't have a positive letter do we send them a letter saying as a result of our discussions we now assume that for more warm self-serving through through the chair gary stalls continues to talk to these people very regularly on our behalf more than happy to to discuss with him to see what he believes to be an appropriate response and we 're doing an update there 'll be an update to the scp working party very soon but we 're still working on those so i 'm quite happy to take a notice and think someone else thinks it 's a good idea well adjusted the working party i have a suggestion i 've often had to use that myself when you can 't get something out of your choices self-serving letters say thanks we 've had these discussions you 've confirmed the following problem so i now assume that if this is not correct could you please invite because we 're getting to us it 's very difficult and it would be nice to have that letter to pick with any grand communications hi sorry 26th of april meeting with rspca regarding dog matter which is half a bit over halfway two thirds of the way down 54. so we met with a number of parties including the police and the rspca about a ongoing matter of marina and we are looking at options around trying to deal with that matter i did have a look back through this miranda dog issue and it may be appropriate for the next for the planning because i 'm not sure but this has been going on for is it five years this has been going is why we 're looking at all our revenues and our associates okay because i i know there have been some fairly disaffected landfolders down there yes and i think it 's you know i think it 's going to through the chair as the police indicated they would love some documentary evidence to support that rather than hearsay we are working together with all the authorities to try and resolve this matter has anyone put cameras on we 're working with all the authorities to try and resolve this matter okay well i just hope it gets resolved after five years it 's been going on through the chair there 's more to it than just that okay thank you that 's all i have now i 'll say that just on part 52 just the overseer maintenance there to review is is that to strengthen personnel or support the supervisor after a real big year of grade work so we 're doing that next year that plan throughout of things and yes that is everywhere glad all right thank you any other comments just a query have we on their wild dog program to set dog traps along the brass walls road and they fell timber road to actually trap these dogs that are off-site after those property because this thing would have cost us in excess of thirty thousand dollars the time people have been going out there chuck e ewe because they 're not going to get out of the vehicle not the current one that we just lost but surely goodness if the dogs are off the property we should be able to set the caves on the road reserve and actually catch these dogs the national parks engage the contractors to do it yep so it 's just outside our boundary i can 't understand why we 're not doing it so through the chair this is an lls model and they deal with wild dogs unfortunately under their legislation these aren 't considered wild dogs so there is lots to this and i 'm not in a position to talk to you about it in public there is a lot more to it than than just catching a number of dogs i 'm brief later but this is now the questions come from recommendations [Music] [Music] living units at um curtis street we elected to build and not to do them because we were going to do them better i know this is still not up and i note that this is something that the director has inherited through the chair thank you councillor um again as we mentioned uh last week it 's uh it 's in the timeline to do in the budget today um we haven 't_''_5713.199 uh set a date at this stage but um i just thought soon the slab was done i think not to get the builder to do it and we 're just coming on and see severe frost that has been done i can 't understand why it 's not that i 've ever engaged somebody put that way i 'll ask you alex to do the work put the cardboard through the chair um no yeah okay thank you through the chair what we do have is planes for the carports we haven 't engaged the builder to do the work who you were going to do it better and we haven 't done it better we 've got severe frost we 've got cars sitting out in the frost and we haven 't done it that 's my concern that we we can talk the talk all you like the money 's there why isn 't it done the slab 's been down to what eight months just we tell people how to build their houses yet we can 't even put a couple of cardboards up ourselves i 'm sorry i just it doesn 't work okay council cable comprehensive report medicare and uh somebody else who 's been very busy now the comments [Music] request for planning certificates just another term is like the zoning stimulus so perhaps when people are selling properties they include plans to be within their um contract of sale or vice versa when they 're purchasing a property they make many students to understand the zoning what is permitted on that site um and just for you know since you know we we were busy growing areas madam there just looking at some trends in six down new transportable home on carl wood road comment are we seeing more transportable homes as an alternative three two i think it 's a one-off council sorry i 'm not aware of uh okay that 's fine thank you coming through further down our dual occupancy on the karlwood road just wanting do we know uh what size block that is i understand that all blocks within the council area have entitlements with dual use of existing shed is habitable to dwell in rooms absolutely existing dwelling and modified um that 's well within our guidelines of living in a shed that 's correct as long as the facilities are there and plus is a habitable space thank you applications where it says in the first paragraph um minimum 8-week delay in assessment of applications is that what 's meant or that 's into your full use of works through the chair uh thank you for the question counselor possibly a full choice of words included in that eight week time frame i would suggest we would be looking at native notification um advertising for example some of complex because up to 500 um addresses trust being advertised we 'd also be undertaking a preliminary assessment of the applications and advising applicants if there 's any additional information required um so giving them feedback during that time frame we also want to take referrals to other agencies for example the rural fire service or heritage um sometimes they can take upwards of 28 days to respond or longer so moving to the new missiles government planning portal we hope it would reduce the transitioning sorry the time um for referrals to other agencies so they 'll be dealing through the uh through the portal as well um i hope that answers the question and through the chair that 's correct and upwards or on average around that time correct yes this is a comment on what was just said a minute ago but a lot of the work can be done concurrently you can send off to the rfs and you can be actually doing the va as well through the channel it 's only like a staff that 's taken eight weeks really isn 't it through back from the agencies and the timing there has been a significant workload and we 're trying to get through those [Music] 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a labor phase have forgiven councilman thank you council should we speak to this reporter in a very busy summer uh well documented what we have done and what 's continuing to be done the weather is holding up a little bit that 's probably possibly helping a bit uh just on 63 we 've got the baptist planey project traffic new south wales 4.1 million dollars here is that actually the improvement of the road or what does that actually mean um through the tube the lineage is limelight it 's yeah so it 's mainly line markings widening of the shoulders so the foot of the man going to battle they 're actually going to do the milling does that go back with a hot mix of a hundred mil or you know years for this year so there 'll be a nominal 150 depth of that 's really playing up there through the chair because there 's been an ongoing issue heavy vehicles is affecting the payment um and as such will be only those you can 't communicate that road anymore um yeah again through the chair it 's really at the determination of transport for new south wales in terms of how they allocate funding um certainly something that we will continue to push for the upgrade obviously i think that it 's certainly probably a better outcome than the spray ceilin and the ongoing heavy vehicles that utilize that particular section here the problem with that curve is it pops away on the outside elevation not there but they will probably won 't correct that but if they get 150 ml of this one there that 'll fix the time yeah um well it 's gravel pit ca are we concerned about getting outside the boundary there or because that 's just the standard procedure um for the chair small formalities around where the life the pit is at its current time we 're looking at um given the actual floor and through the da process to go through our blasting so it does more a review of the development of the future development application process okay oh yes um having spoken to quite a few landowners and rate players for the last couple of weeks which i 'd say are very you know banged on about the mosaic road quite a bit but they 're very happy to see some works and some of them we 've even said they went to those art school last time there was anything done there which accurate but anyway they 're very happy with that um and i spoke to hong kong residents as well and councilman mckinnon very well have had the same feedback um they 're they 're very happy out there with the attention they 're getting in the actual work was out there the other day and the work looks good and that 's what i must admit there 's some major improvements to the last one the other thing i know there 's probably another okay for chris i don 't want to get in the head but um the um has been maintained with the extended growing period and the overheads with i think people realize that the outcome starts really busy and to also keep up with this has been pretty well managed in a good event by our staff i think we should be congratulated um just referencing 0.4863 [Music] i think that 's quite good it gives you a better idea of what 's going on uh and then going back to 62 of the safer roads program i guess personal experience of this audio tactile edge lines um is that for you is that extremely expensive to implement because some roads i 've been on to that have the the outer edge i 'm assuming you mean the little things you know um not only the edge lines but also there 's some roads where the space there are they 're broadening the center lines and putting in at least you know maybe two or one tactile line down the middle of that there i 've just found it a really safe method of road construction it appears to me to require a wider madame from the director well you 're is a certainly a process where you know through the safety roads program where vehicles are have or have been identified through data regression to be going off-road as a preventative measure and yes they are a raised type reverberated type strip for that very reason not really much wider than the average line mark but more so from say the audio point of view where it brings awareness or awareness to the driver that they are um on the outer edge or again in the center line here so it 's on both either but like all the v1 lines which is the outer lines or the uh the center lines also i 've seen them in the center lines and actually bigger spacing too three lines there it 's really good i was always yep so you 're relevant to the road um so whether it be a freeway or whether it be a state highway or uh [Music] up to 110 kilometers on the freeway where you 'll find it prohibitively expensive sorry yes the cost is substantially more um the grant funding the reasoning behind the crash data and statistics is where transport have supported that with the funding again through that i would think of the business of the o 'connell though that that would be a prime location for that to be along this entire length really yeah through this year certainly something that can be raised with regard to transport 's approach i think that you know the safety and road safety and the towards zero approach or transport it 's really something they are looking at with a lot of upgrades now that it seems to be more apparent thank you very much thank you very much um i just wonder if there 's an update on the bull hill landslip um because i have been to lakefall because i did speak to the person involved in relation to the western benefit the other day forgot to ask question but i do have to ring them tomorrow so the question might be from them yes yes but what 's happening with the land slip because they 're the same owner indeed through the chair you i believe with the wet weather that there were some delays with them getting to site again on what i have been i suppose told is that they will be there as soon as they can and i 'm hoping that will be within the coming weeks again yeah apologize i i certainly can 't_''_6680.719 do any more than certainly contact them and try and get the confirmed date but once i do which i 'm happy to share that with you no it 's just that i envisage being asked the question if i raise the other issue monthly activity report corporate services recommendation the item information can i have a mover please that 's the capable and the secondary council darling thank you council cable report again comprehensive very comprehensive [Music] i look at that scene as a youth report and it makes me think of um i think an important point that councillor gibbons made earlier when he was talking about the ball he was talking about uh loneliness which i think has been recent media coverage or it has a national illness and this is a think we should treat such a comment lightly that um and we should be very pleased with efforts where the council itself has done such things to deal with that social scourge of london i think that 's a really worthwhile use of our resources and our activities i commend this council for doing it in so many ways from the independent living units through to the attempt to stimulate community interest that can be really hard to achieve and and sometimes disappointing in its patronage and stuff like that but i commend this council to be dealing uh with the social issues in its community in this little oberon area i think it 's an excellent difference something that i was going to mention and um just i think we should recognize the effort that the director and her staff put into the seniors week and the on the ways to art um i went to the opening and i was very less less or fewer exhibits but particularly in the open section some absolutely exquisite pieces um which would stand up as artwork anyway and it came from sandy renzeli is turning a giant blind leaf out of the ends of a uh she stand on the road and she 's absolutely beautiful so it shows what people can do and i think she 's she 's now going to the regional yes possibly onto the stage put the recommendations investments the recommendation is there that council received the reporter 's information and i have a leader please ellsworthy contacted us the numbers down are a little bit depressing that 's what it is no comments look at the recommendation counsellors we 're in favor thank you very grants monthly updates the recommendation is that the report be received this information can i have a move please account for the given thank you and a second opposed okay thank you that 's it 's great to see that we 've received 50 000 to upgrade our planning pool obviously to bring it in line and that can be spent on a number of things including it system upgrades which um also i know the ground application submitted including the button and the crown reserves one which is including black springs toilet and showers and the wreath and um this is the bottom page 79 that maybe this i thought the 349 000 for red ground played approved no it wasn 't still pending is it [Music] that 's right um the numbers seem to the right number ah through the chain that was that 's correct so what how much sorry we obviously submitted a grant application under a community building partnerships over on dog pound and off leash gog park how much did we ask for in respect that 's already going in on our shoe right through the chair possible let 's take a notice to let 's fly through the chair to be honest i think that that one wasn 't lodged because there was no matching allocation from council but we 'll be looking to support it through the stronger country communities round four so is that like seeing new grant opportunities correct okay i take it v we 've lodged something in respect to b or are going where 's the cutoff date for that and that that i 'm assuming if we have a problem and dog rocks yeah yeah prince here there 's certainly an option there too or an opportunity to put an application together uh with some statistical data uh for doblox road that is one of our options at this stage so when does that have to be um so the report on the next one will come back in june obviously um so can i just make a comment on that um through the chair now as the time councils if you have a project to contact staff that you 'd like to see included in that 781 000 worth of projects i 've been advised that there is a um whilst the 50 is targeted towards women in sport there has been an amendment made that acknowledges that smaller country councils may not be able to meet that demand so it 's not a it 's not a reply however it 's highly desirable so on that issue if i could just come back martin i mean we discussed this i thought at some length previously and sporting complex [Music] but the issue was if we complex then we would be waiving our rights if we allocated this large section of it to the supporting object um is there any way of saying it will go to that if these grants are successful otherwise if you go to these other very good traders having a bet each way i don 't think you 're allowed to have a better each way in the grant funding for career funding because that 's the problem i see if we go with the sporting complex and we don 't get a substantial grant somewhere else there is no sporting conflict then there is no sporting enough to put this grant here to put this grant i think that that 's where the council will need to take a serious look at how they want to move on this and whether it 's a staging application or whether it 's through another process we have to cancel that determination one of the one of the the projects we 've brought back will be to spend the money on the over in sports group yes but i know that it won been a number already indicated through this process there will be councillors obligation to prioritise their projects the last section section 5 page 81 um their underspends is approximately 25 000. is that inclusive um of the 26 815 surplus the fitness center which is referenced on page 98 and they through the chair they 're separate they 're separate yep right so really we 've got a surplus of some fifty thousand um yes yes in the other i 'll have to talk to the other yes i understand that but overall we 've got it so we are certain that we can we have to apply to repurpose both those amounts this 25 000 and the bit under and and the residual herbalists on page 98 and we 're certainly allowed to both have been given in principle support to do so quite easily given the nature and how they were originally applied for it so under the signage project which is suggested that this 25 000 that 's grants what work would that include in the town signing presence um so it would deliver a number of to the outer region so a lga sign at dog rocks two town signages at black springs um not the not not the entrance not the entrance or the town signage so the boards one of the suggestions is also to create new decals for roadside are there street signs that can put the council 's branding on on the streets on rather than the corporate logo as we currently have so to transition those out all of this is in line with your your town signage workbook or the the document that was approved by council to further funding and moving forward and it was included i just can 't_''_7515.76 because it was in the priorities because i thought we prioritized the general this is additional stuff that has able to be repurposed given the nature of that ongoing requirement within the fund so there is the opportunity to repurpose it quite easily that way where it 's not as easy for the other projects whereby they 've all been completed okay as long as we 're happy that [Music] to the localities and some lga entry signs along welcome to oberon so signage okay so on the campbells river okay campbell 's river bridge you put up aside correct just make sure it doesn 't obscure the access and egress from that bridge anymore under your toolkit there 's a provision that says you won 't do that i must admit i 'd actually rather be fighting the bridge but it can 't_''_7626.239 be done and that 's about you 've indicated that 's in bathurst shy you think i would have thought the bridge was 50 50. no i think that 's in bathurst have we sent a letter to baptist council i 've seen many others that 's cancelled on that gym um i keep on getting comments about how [Music] comment on the two toilet locks on um number two and number three um i thought the general manager was going to use the um on page 76 um the one over in the caravan park was in excess of five hundred thousand dollars i realized that the brief is going to take off really big one day but anyway now that 's fine anything we used up at the show ground there 's not enough physical room in the room if you 've got kids to change if you give a drink if they 're into having a shower you don 't need any more facilities no more toilets or wash baskets it 's just not that it just needs to be safe 1.2 metres 1.5 metres wider the plan 's fine but i just it 's up there doing some paint denier trouble moving around okay it 's just physically not yep just needs more space especially for our final continuing the discussion with laurier water and sewer plant restored the recommendation is that the report item 1407 has received this information can i have a mover please has the givens and the second account thank you do you wish to speak to the reports again consistently uh similarly men and men just wish the sounds odd 44.9 was a bigger number than it is okay any other comments from this one counsellors recommendation all in favor page 84 1408 once we update status of council resolutions the recommendation is that the report a second to place [Music] in respect to page 86 on the oberon sports complex second paragraph from about halfway above about halfway down that page the application for the jrpp was made the 26th of february and confirmation 29th of march when do you expect comments back or approval back um through the chair it 's currently on exhibition right so it 's gone through that initial phase where an application is lodged it 's it 's looked at for for appropriateness it comes back to us um i understand that it 's gone through the first phase of that portal and now we 're at a point where no notification is going to help um on my understanding that we confirmed the notification will be made to a radius of 500 meters around the site which substantially includes a lot of overlap so it should go to a lot of people to at least get out there so they already know it 's out there anyway but the notification will be wide wide and theory so when the comments have do that when does when 's the exhibition and then and so do we expect it to be approved by june end of june by july by august it will go to the joint regional planning panel who will make that decision that generally revolves around a like a public meeting or a public enquiry where they make that decision so it may or may not be done before september it will i would hope that it 's fine as well and truly council the next one is 89 and 90. um council starts to provide advice on the following aspects of the design up to my community 's hub um when are we likely to get that report is it coming to council with the final design for the pump through the chair that 's my understanding because the final design hasn 't been confirmed yet i was a bit confused and it may relate to something later um but i 'm talking abstracted that we 're going out for a design a request pretender for the design are we not yes the design and construct i have seen somewhere else we 're going out for request also going out for a request for a design and construction so i was confused i have read this somewhere all right so page 66 i believe it 's in the report yeah so so if we 're going out from architectural design for design why are we then going for rft for design and construct should be shorter just to construct because there are a number of architectural companies that provided differing designs so we 've got we 've got a concept design yes and we are going out for a detailed design is that right so expressions of interest were published by a tenderloin seeking submissions 16 architectural responses seven structural responses from that four of those were asked to resubmit a request for the proposal including a cost it will be those before that you engage a project manager to in fact nut out the bad ones and come back with the good ones whereby it will have a design and construction costs associated with that but you 're going out to architectural firms to provide a request you 've got you 've got out the request before architectural practices have been invited to a success um have they been invited to submit a request for proposal or have they been invited to submit a proposal in response to a request for proposal normally someone puts a proposal to you as to what they 're going to do you go out for a request for them to submit a proposal that 's right so they 're submitting proposals they have submitted proposals so basically what 's happening through the chair um so the there are two steps the first one is the design and the second one is the construction company will pick up the final design and the construction so the you 're asking the architects the architect will yeah the architect will work with the construction company so when they finalize the design and it 's approved and then the construction company will pick it up and they will work with the architect to take it through to construction and completion normally i thought when you issued a rf2 rfp for design and construct you have a conceptual design and then you ask the so that 's what we pretended but you but with gear we 've gone out to a architect to get a detailed result from the concept design that council approved absolutely but we 're now saying all right we have a detailed design to construction companies give us i design and construct something so what you 're saying is that the construction companies are saying this is our nominated designer abc and you need to engage that designer and come back to us with a total tender including the design and construction is that how i understand it no through the chair i 'll explain it so so what has happened is we have gone out for an open tender for the to finalize the design and that was without the cost to determine that they could actually do the project that we were after from those applications within the project managers then determined the group of companies that would fit that criteria from their applications and those companies are being assessed to do the final design of the final detailed design at the same time we are also doing the end of once the design is finalized it will pick up that design and they will be able to work together to finalize the construction so it 's not two complete separate items but it 's the design and then the construction will work with the design to the endpoint so i 'm confused then how you 're issuing a design and construct contract to rft if the design we have this design give us give us yeah give us a cost and a schedule and the whole thing you 'd ask in an rft request attendant right as to what [Music] to build that what it 's going to cost the schedule and all the other things you would normally ask so you 're not asking them to redesign the design you 're asking them to cost so that 's why i 'm asking why it 's an rft for design and construct because if you look at the conventional rft for design and construct it says right we have this project here 's a conceptual design yep give us a detailed design and a construct and construct it 't have to deal with an architect on one hand and the construction company on the other you basically control a whole lot but i 'll leave that to you but i 'm just not completely understanding when we 've already gotten detailed design it 's going to be part of our rft as i understand it as it goes out to the potential construction company and then i 'm asking are you going to have a direct contract between the construction company and the architect how is it going to work but i 'll leave that to operations but i have some i 'm just asking a question maybe you 'd like to consider um so sorry going back to the issue i was raising the top of the page 90 when when do we time-wise when do we consider that we 'll have that breakdown of the fit out et cetera we 're aiming for through to there we 're aiming for the june okay could we as as councilman carter 's already rise could when we do this could we sort of it does actually say on june order now we talked about at the last meeting that you would both be provided together okay the update report for june meeting um it doesn 't actually say we 're going to have a preferred architect and a preferred construction contractor by then is that what 's intended to approve or not that is what is intended so we have a preferred architect and construction company well the architect we 've already done the design will have selected we 've done the details so we 'll see the detailed design of the at the june meeting that 's the aim yes that 's what we 're working towards and where we have ish but we won 't have a we won 't have issues and have backed the tender from the construction companies by then so we won 't know what if our indicative pricing is anywhere near correct yes that is what 's coming that the whole package is anticipated coming in june so including the indicator that is our anticipation that 's what the project manager is working towards okay so um except for the caps 's still 75 meters to be installed that 's what i i was yeah i was wondering if i i thought we were still waiting for the material so yes it 's due during may that 's the current advice that we received from the contractor recently right but i thought the material was received in may but we haven 't received it yet so the 75 meters is still outstanding um so i think i 'm not sure that 's closed is it well the recruiting team that that resolution has been made so we 've engaged the fencer we 've engaged the so we 've used the mortise up to the 21 000 we 've engaged the fencer we 've reconciled the 140 we know where the short floor can come from technical services verify the length and the recess has been considered as part of the charge so that 's why it says matter closed but i 'm sure the director will bring back a report with beautiful pictures finalizing how the fence has been delivered and if it 's to be dealt with in may i just in turn the matter 's closed in terms of the six resolution points um ready to cut the return of watercolors thank you we not resolve the modification errors design our previous meeting um completely outside and before this grant was approved this community huh that that resolution is superseded by the hub because it 's a full redesign how does that be superseded what 's the procedure i don 't remember going through any surgery any meeting to do them through and sharing what the process is through the chair i 'm sure that one of the reports that we 're provided to about the hub talk to the existing one and my understanding is that as part of that new hub development the old resolution lapsed but we wouldn 't do that can we find that information because the money is going to be used as part of the developmental hub rather than yeah but we resolved to actually spend that money another way and i don 't recall changing that resolution or because it 's been raised my president my record is that we have an take it up and bring it back thank you the other comments we should be considering a meter royalty rate as well if if the cosgos are not prepared to sell that that discussion should have take place just the same as the one [Music] on i thought the report on the extension of the library was brought back to us as a matter of urgency because the money had to be spent by a certain time and the council offered opted to go with i think uh playing two wouldn 't it was one i would modificate suggested but i thought that was you know i agree it was could be accident i 've never heard of it recently it should be is that what happens if you fade on something and then you do something behind it does the matter get rescinded by voting on another matter beyond it doesn 't have to be rescinded unless there 's been action on it that 's right okay the only uh only a resistant nation only needs to be bought if there 's been an action on on the resolution up a matter of urgency overall indoor fitness center project close out report the recommendation is that the report is received his information can i have a look at the place that 's my party mr mccarthy very good report thank you um likewise a well-presented um uh close-out report i thought that was excellent it 's very clear and the bottom line is here thank you any other comments on councillors for the recommendation all in favor thank you page 100 item 1410 fixing local roads campbells river road project progress report recommendation is there that report is receivers information can i have a move councilman kevin and council given thank you do you wish to speak to this thank you matter man um yes this has been a successful project and as council mckinney said previously there 's been a lot of very um complimentary comments on this um i just hope that the work that 's over the campbells river crossing currently is um not new tree well i do hope it 's new we get funding for a um our aqueduct to avida um but um being done but i understand that if there 's a kilometer of work there it might have cost us a couple hundred pounds and that was my only only concern if we do get the subject of funding but it is the [Music] get through the chair certainly at this stage it 's on track um as projected uh the only thing slowing it is the cold weather for now and then certainly if we have a drive-in later part of the year that you know we will recommence the actual work as soon as we can and again depending on contractor availability and to also assist with the myriad of projects i 'm presenting for the next language yeah a couple of weeks now since the campbell 's river project sort of wound up and a bit lucky with the weather most of the way and it helps a lot to run a budget and you know did a bit of uh wet weather there and the arc downright and a bog that had to be dealt with as you went along so that 's um [Music] well it uh three kilometers from black springs uh this watchfield road was going to be like a reseal because the rain had been reconstructed and so it really only leaves about 10 to 11 kilometers left um so yeah it 's around about 50 percent of the way through very promising thank you thank you councilman the other comments on this one for the recommendation all in favor aye thank you item 14 11 fixing local the recommendation is that the report is receivers information can i have a mover please councilman kevin thank you in a second thank you thousand kevin do you wish to speak to this reporter thank you madame um again this has been a successful project but i noticed that um there was a lot of mud to deal with um when was campbell 's in the road at the archstone road in varaga and i did have someone query me as to whether the quality of the gravel was up to scratch and i fooled them they were and i suggested they speak to the technical services director if they have an issue um i contacted peter oh yeah the technical services manager i certainly had a discussion with the person and assured them the quality that was up to scratch uh again through the chair it 's it 's a royal gravel um yes the gravel is for the purpose of sub-base and alike and a game where as you 've seen on this road we 've had stabilizers because it needs to be brought to a specification for the geotechnical representation through the report reflexor okay so we 're satisfied it 's up to scratch though i mean certainly yes so again the better geotechnical testing is that assurance yes thank you very much thank you um not a great field word except the photos are impressive and it 's a very popular project nice weather [Music] these projects was a lot of geotechnical investigation to understand i suppose the substrata uh varying in different localities right across the uh 23 kilometers of cameras of the road and again different material on the uh on the arkansas road so this imperative that we get that right in the percentages of additive that 's forestry corporation flores thank you any other questions on district councils put the recommendation all in favor council is page 107 15 over business yes i 'm just about to get to the council council mccarthy has requested council consider an urgent matter without notice so council mccarthy could you please briefly um outline the motion you 'd like for the council to consider after which i will call for a secondary that the matter be heard without notice um council mccarthy is the only council able to speak to this motion that the matter be heard council mccarthy what is your thanks [Music] business i 'd like to discuss the closure of the road at hampton and to the intersection of genoa with the landslides and i think it 's very important that we do it and i think we should use the urgent business calls in the local government act to carry out this recommendation thank you you 'll have a second job at the do you have a second uh that the business be heard council people thank you okay all in favor that the business we matter is of sufficiently urgent nature to be heard so council mccarthy would you like to put your motions my recommendation is the council right to the new south wales premier the deputy premier and the local member who is also the road minister requesting that the that a dual road be constructed in the general and state forest between hampton and the dutchman road to bypass the swedish that has occurred in the area on riding the the road is closed and another weather event may see more slippage events clarification okay so is that a sufficient for your motion that council write to the new south wales premier deputy premier and roads minister requesting that a dual road be constructed in the hampton state forest to bypass the hampton road land slip that 's the motion that 's the motion i can need a second before you can speak to it okay do i have a second one yes councilman thank you okay council mccarthy would you like to speak to your recommendation um the road has been blocked for some time with little progress heavy vehicles were vehicles or frequency of use the roads are in the over lithgow and bathurst area are narrow not marked center lines and in most cases the bridges in most cases and the bridges in lithgow already damaged may be impacted on if if damaged onto the western railway line if more impact on these bridges occurs great cost to the local businesses competing against others supplying products cars are driving on the local roads not sharing the road surface the roads can be done with the base road in the forest the road can be done with the road based in the forest and the forest being public land and one and a half million dollars announced today is on safety upgrade on the dutmoy road for safety improvements only not to carry out any slippage that occurred at the hampton area i know it 's a bit rough but anyway thank you i support councilman mccarthy 's motion on on several points um perfectly on the safety aspect of it for um people having to travel um to let go of the sydney via darren r suggles bypass which really it 's going back to the horse and cart days to go along that track to go to bathurst now is also quite harrowing for some people um [Music] because of the amount of heavy traffic in patients and that that 's shown there so there 's a major safety concern and the thing is that a lot of people come and talk to me and i 'm sure that they 've spoken to clive as well is that there 'll be a severe accident or even a fatality and we need to try and do something to avoid that it 's our duty of care to do that um the second thing is the impact that it 's having on local businesses the cost of fuel the carriers stock carriers the you know transport companies uh significant increase in fuel costs was only speaking to one of the operators today and he brought it up when 's counseling do something significant about the hampton roads we have we have been working with other people but it 's very have been hard enough for some of them as it reason is business is in town now we 've been a little bit protected that way because of um travelers and holidaymakers because of cave if that wasn 't the case we would be a lot of businesses in town would be really suffering and it 's um i think it 's a significant significant downturn some some businesses are saying it 's not worth making them on the weekends because people that are coming through here they 're not stopping because they know they 've got to get through that other road and get onto the highway either that way or that way before dark or at a certain time so they 're the three main reasons but you know i think we really we really really need to consider this safety thing to impress on all the levels of government right through that it is a major concern not only for our government area and our community but people in bathurst people that come from ballast out here let 's go out here vice versa it 's it is a real problem and um you know i know a bit and we must soon you know and can 't get to not return the blind either but we can 't um not raise our voice and and see if we can get something done this landslip 's not going to be the last one um you know so we don 't want to become the side track off replacing off the side track off the great western highway we 've either got to get the road gunner down the midland meadow flat or we 've got to get a road around the back of our window or something there and come by past the hampton gorge so i fully support council mccarthy 's motion and i think you know we 're probably gonna from what i heard today we might see some petitions coming their way thank you thank you another customer thank you very much look i am i support council mccarthy but i do i had this discussion with someone the other day in relation to this particular piece of road um so you know last life i did quite a lot of traveling overseas in issues like this with land slip areas they do short tunnels and then they have concrete encasing over the road for the landscape so it doesn 't prevent passing that would be another option here as you notice there 's this there 's several areas in particular this weather bulb piece comes out here that could be tunnel and then you can have a concrete construction over the road where the land slips up that is what the europeans do and other countries do where they have bad landscape areas they don 't just keep fixing it that would be an alternative and i 'd suggest a nightfall shadow that that may we could put that as an alternative in the proposal uh but i don 't see any reason from what i 've seen with roads in europe etc why that couldn 't be done here it 's basically a concrete canopy over the road so that is an alternative so i would be maybe that we can take board i mean that would be a fairly a longer term outcome i think what council mccarthy and council mckechnie well is it shorter term it 's going to have to be a dual dual dual road through the forest that 's what you see that 's what the motion is yeah which is um which is going to be expensive as well well let 's yeah okay thank you we 'll take that how 's the people thank you madam mayor um just on that point i don 't think we should start telling them how to build the road what we want is for access and and we want it soon uh as um uh councilman said this is going to keep happening all we need is another storm or two and and that road will go again it 's very fragile country three there um it just it was discussed a bit at the um uh business and tourism association meeting the other night and the cost to businesses was was highlighted there and as as councilman kevin said all of the businesses in this town rely on road transport to bring their goods in and the cost i heard on the radio the other day young extra 58 kilometers via bathurst is costing them heaps because going out that way they can take a truck can do two trips to sydney in a day going out by bathurst they can only do one so that has meant that they have to employ uh subcontractors to to deliver the product to fill to fulfill their their obligations for the contracts that they 've got so it is costing them a heap of money um um talked about it at the business tourism association reading the other night that the difficulty that they 're having and the extra cost that it is means to their business um yeah i it doesn 't matter where the road goes so long as so long as it is one that is going to be easier to maintain and not going to fall off the side of the hill i will just note that many businesses in town have will have contacted bulgaria on a personal level i do know that i had a call into school today um to try to find out when hampton might be open but i haven do i think as a council we we realize what these issues are most definitely and we are working and encouraging our community to contact their local member and minister rose um and more than happy to get this letter done with with if this goes through with a short term and maybe a longer term um solution or an option um but i think it is that would be supported by the major business owners in this town and we can support the business owners exactly that 's the whole idea and that 's the way i see it thank you i support the the thrust of this particular promotion i think we 've got to be very careful at this stage about solution i think that the idea going up old window road and back down is a very short-term thing and i think it 'll probably be overcome by having at least one money in access the way we 've had it for some almost feels like 12 months now but that is a very fragile bit of country through there and there needs to be a all weather and that reliability can be achieved by bypassing that particular bit of country now how that 's done or whether it 's done with avalanche protection or whatever you choose is something that needs careful consideration but the short-term solution may be something on window road but i suspect that will be overtaken by the hampton road it 's probably opening i think it 's towards the end of next month i know being certain though but by no means certain that 's the i think all the arguments about the increased traffic on the secondary roads in bathurst area and lisco causing increased congestion on conga road all absolutely spot off it is one limited land slip and a quite remote road is causing habit across three to three local government areas and it is likely to occur again i accept everyone seems to be agreed to that and the answer is not something that is short-term to the answer but probably bloody expensive any other comments council givens yes i 've been told there 's some [Music] local companies as well and it 's up to that 's made up of the haulage uh cost the expenses to go a lot further wages the time lost production but just looking at the map from where it starts that 's a logging hall road and you can follow it right along in state forest right to within about half a k to hampton so you know the basis is there of a fairly solid road and a lot of trucks have uh chartered timber out they 've met on it they have over the past 10 days so i guess that 's something we we should put in this uh request that the major part of the raid is used for logging hall it certainly might be in the future for a long time because there 's more points it 's over the major bridge would be thank you yes thank you madame i wrote in this request we use the state forest road and that 's to stop the excuse that we 'd have to resume and having known mr tool for a long time that was one of the arguments that we 've got to for excuses why i can 't and by by this being constructed in state owned ground there 's no excuse can 't_''_10438.319 go ahead thank you thank you councillor i 'm going to put the recommendations all in favor confidential response in accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government general general

page six item six presentations we have a presentation this evening from simon evans from coffee erin brooks and us selma from weber architects it 's a 15-minute presentation giving a brief overview of the hub and there will be 15 minutes after that if required for counselors to ask questions so i 'd now like to welcome simon who i believe is speaking first to our england uh thank you madam mayor uh hello everyone i 'll get started straight away so we can make the most of our time together um if i can just share the screens okay can you all see that all right can you see that now we can okay uh just getting started then so i 'll go over the community consultation uh results um survey results and then also touch on the the business case this page talks about the the results from the the survey so we did the survey both online and a hard copy survey that was decided upon so we could try and reach as many people as possible and when we looked at those results the report includes their results individually but also combines them to give us some percentages here so what we found was that you know 72 percent either strongly supported or supported the proposed redevelopment of the community hub and some of the comments there you know supporter there 's a real need to uh expand the library uh and the community function spaces and provide some more exhibition spaces etc um there was also recorded you know 24 that posed or strongly opposed so there 's a few percent in the middle that either didn 't respond or are on the fence um next point was that 76 percent of respondents agreed that the existing location of the community center is a suitable location and further uh said that the the survey indicated that the important areas or issues to include in the redevelopment included facility was more accessible making sure we had better function spaces and they also wanted to make sure that the development was uh considerate and limited any impacts during construction and wanted to increase and provide better meeting rooms and exhibition spaces we also noted that 53 percent of respondents indicated that they don 't have any issue with the proposed development that come from question 3 where they could tick the box for no issue or none issue but we also noted however that the respondents that did raise concerns raised concerns about the following issues here mainly to do with parking and traffic 32 thought there would be issues with uh didn 't like the redevelopment because they issues potential issues with parking uh traffic i was 24 and 20 percent of those who oppose the uh redevelopment um opposed to because of the like proposed location uh and there was some other that thought the funds could be used um better spent elsewhere if i move on to the business case now when we looked at the business case the in the site option analysis the aim including the indicative sizes of the the facilities and the footprint that would be adequate to accommodate you know the growing population this was done in conjunction with a community consultation work and with the architect we also had the aim of identifying possible venues or site locations for the proposed community hub and we looked at the possible venues or locations in conjunction with council and we took many suggestions from that community consultation we 're also trying to make sure we determine some evaluation criteria and methodology that would be used to assess each venue or site and then we conducted the the site option analysis and reported against those evaluation criteria and finally it was to come up with to identify and recommend a preferred site option to counsel so we did it in two stages stage one looked at evaluation criteria of kind of ownership of the the land or property and then its proximity to town center that gave us a short list and then with the shortlist we also looked at other things like the cost to town centre again any issues with parking alignment with uh councils kind of functional and strategic requirements other site constraints any other impact to operations or displacement of occupants etc so we 're going through that process the list of potential venues we found or developed or agreed as the list here the nine venues so number one being the existing community center site but we also considered other options that were raised by the community being the malachi hall the oberon visitor center on ross street also the oberon common on edith street we looked at the oberon council chambers the oberon showgrounds the rsl black sprints community hall and the christian life center and the map there shows the the general location of each of those in going through that process the shortlist was down to two that being the existing community center and the oberon council chambers they both ticked the box as far as the proximity to the town centre so that anyone of the public that are visiting through town doing their daily shop or work or whatever could easily walk from where they 've already parked down to the location make um so so some of the reasons then was that it 's obviously owned by council uh land of property and that proximity to the town centre so with comparing those two on the short list we found that the preferred option recommended option is option one being the existing location of the community center and here 's a list of of some of the uh reasons that support that case um you know number one being that it 's it 's very central location it 's only a short walk from um to oberon street in the centre of town obviously council owned land and buildings it would enable council to truly maximize the footprint of that site building the larger community hub and kind of the uh the option to actually merge and update the libraries um that was the next point about the the multiple design options um demolishing some of those existing buildings whether it be all or part to create this new community hub it gives you some strong functional alignment connection between the the library and the the new community hub functions the option existing facilities at that community hall space and we believe that there is opportunity or the possibility to add more car parking to the actual site or nearby that may be on streets nearby or actual the other car parks and areas nearby and compared to the existing um council chambers it would be much simpler and easier to construct on this site um because you don 't have the restrictions of those buildings or neighbors on either side of you and the tighter site that the your current council chamber sits on and we would see that the traffic or construction impacts to the community would be very low at this location as well so that actually includes all of my slides i 'll bring um stop sharing the screen and bring her all back up and i think we can ask he protects kieran and eus to um take us through the next part evening everyone good evening everyone see that screen right now yes we can um basically um simon has already covered some part of the analysis we 're going to just go really quick uh main points that we want to consider for the design options that we 've we we are presenting tonight uh and then we 'll go straight into the options because of the time constraints uh as you 're aware you have already all the booklet with all the information that it provides with uh how we 've got into these options uh preview preliminary options that we did at the beginning with uh the first trying to approach to the brief and other kind of information that we are not going to show tonight so um if we go straight in there what we could we could say is the interesting part of where the the site is located that it 's really close to the city center that it 's five minutes walk basically from anywhere in the city center and 10-minute walk over nearby kind of basically the entire main city of oberon uh in regards to the the site analysis and how it is located we found really interesting that there 's this potential um kind of circulation connecting with the main street uh just at the lane that connects with the main street and connects with the the parking uh parking connections is packing from council that is at the other side of the street that could be actually a really interesting element to pursue and to improve uh and then in regards to the site uh you probably know because you 've been around but uh you know there 's the main connection with the street um if we move forward uh north is uh basically at the top of uh the site so it 's basically giving us light into the library right now and that 's one of the crucial elements that we 've chosen in order how the layout has been distributed um in regards to how the the building has been thought to work uh there 's there 's the library which is a really important item for the community and for the project there 's the function function spaces that it 's also really important which is basically the hub itself that it 's somehow an area that it can be subdivided and then there 's an element of circulation that it 's this fourier art gallery that it can be combined and used by the function spaces or by the library so if we go straight into the what 's going on this is what you have existing but that 's what it 's already there uh this is the old dentistry uh this is the bob hooper uh function building and this is the library um currently and for any of the proposals what we 've decided is that the uh the dentist building couldn 't be really be reused uh because of its type of construction because of how it 's distributed how it can how how old it is and the lack of maintenance that it has had so we believe that the dentistry building needs to go and then for the other option for the three options that we we are going to present tonight we 've chosen one that it 's actually removing all the buildings another one that it 's keeping the bob cooper and the library and another one that it 's keeping just the library so if we go forward and see in your booklet as well that one of the things that we 've done is analyze what you currently currently have in the site so there 's a dimensioning in areas and elements analyzing what 's happening right now and that 's uh evaluated for every single of the options when we go into the options uh in regards to what we have right now it is important to consider that the toilets and the accessible toilet that there 's right now in outside it doesn 't comply uh the one in the library so that 's something that needs to be updated if we want to comply with pca if we go straight into the options this one is basically the one that we try to keep the most so basically what we can see here this is the library building and then here at the back this is bob hooper function room what happens in here what we do is we try to work with the levels and we in fill the buildings in between and also at the same time what we 're doing is we that the function room is better placed into this area because north is in this direction so it 's going to have plenty of sunlight direct sunlight into the function room which is really helpful for events and other type of users and also the library will have a bit more of constant indirect light coming basically from the south which is actually what it 's convenient for reading and for kind of a calm spaces uh in regards to how it is distributed all the all the options have basically kind of the same uh distribution and it has the same kind of uses uh the function room is a big space but it 's around between 250 and 300 square meters that depends on the budget and other constraints but that 's kind of the numbers that we 're talking about and then what happens with the function room is that it can be subdivided in three different in three smaller function rooms that it allows to be used differently and separately at the same time we have then i 'm going to change the color for making the business center the business center is we believe that it 's the right if we are keeping all the buildings the right location for the business center is where the bob cooper building is because how it 's already broken down in different rooms and how it is uh we can work more in the kind of little spaces type that uh it requires and it also provides us for uh direct uh connectivity from outside uh in after hours kind of uh usage and then in the center of the development we have the reading area for the library that it 's connected with the ctc and it 's connected with meeting rooms makers uh the youth center so different bubbles that 's happening around the library and then these big central courteous pisco sorry this big center for your space that it 's the one that it gives the circulation it gives the breathing space between the areas and it gives this kind of uh usage that it 's it 's not really on the book it 's more kind of flexible can be adapted to be room can be used with the function centering can be used independently as an art gallery as well uh in all the options as you you will see as well another thing that it 's been always really important is the uh history considering the tapestry hall a tapestry hall is always an area that we 've considered in all this in all the options for a circulation space that it considers this tapestries that it explains the history and explains the heart of oberon uh again talking about heart is is also this fourier element that 's the one that it 's also guided in order to show the craftsmanship of oberon to show the uh elements that you can actually promote uh into the tourism or even inside of the proper people in oberon so i 'm gonna move straight to option two and then later we 'll go for questions if there 's any anything in particular option oh sorry uh option one that 's kind of a general view of uh basically that 's the materiality of how the building is gonna look it 's not 's kind of kind of an indication of what we can do uh with the building uh considering the existing building so what we 're trying to do to explain in this image is we have an existing building that is the bob hopper hooper sorry we have the library and then what we are doing is working intertwine the two buildings and creating this new space that it actually relates both and bring these spaces into the 21st century if we go into the option two that 's a bit uh clearer so one of the constraints that we have with option one is that bob hooper building is actually in diagonal in the middle of the site which creates a lot of constraints of how to design but we believe that it 's a good result what we 've achieved uh but then option two it 's considering the bob cooper is demolished as well then what we have is again the clear functions area at one of the sites we have the reading area with all the elements related to the library closer to the library it foyer again it happens again the same element that we were discussing before about having this circulation space that it can be also used for events and to showcase the craftsmanship from overrun the tapestry hall really important and then at the back we have the business center that it will work similarly to the option one in which basically it 's a set of workstations uh that will be kind of hot desks and then live better in one of the office potentially a second office to be used and other and meeting rooms and other users related uh for option two we also did a bit of an approach of how it could look and the idea is again we 're trying to respect or show some kind of uh intention in regards to the existing library and then we build at the site showing modern way of building and modern technologies for the rest of the building then um if we go to the third option which will be removing the entire all the buildings and starting from scratch that 's the one that it gives us basically we have a blank canvas uh and then what we 're doing in this one is again placing the functions room also subdividable we have the library area at the side we have these really important for you for your art gallery element the tapestry hall at the entry really important and then we go for a business cup at one of the edges and a bit of mixed use which is related to the library and related to the foyer of uh meeting rooms ctc youth center in all the options uh sorry i forgot to say that in all the options we have a kitchen that it 's kind of close to the function room in order to cutter for the function room and toilets and all the other elements that they are required for that in general uh all the options we believe that they are feasible and all the options provide different kind of advantages and disadvantages so basically uh we 're talking that i in order to keep the b the budget on place that it 's something that simon will talk after us order to make uh more demolition so basically the big uh comparison that you can go straight away is you will see that this building considering that everything is demolished it 's smaller than the option only only demolishing bob hooper and this is actually smaller than the option of keeping it all so basically that 's the main difference the the the building that keeps more part can can be bigger within a similar budget but at the same time it creates different constraints about how it 's going to be used because it 's more limited for the existing walls um just as a kind of a little note at the end uh we we see the aesthetics of if we are going to demolish the buildings we see the aesthetics of the new hub as something um blatantly contemporary and uh really honest and really kind of pure and making an image and a statement about uh the area in oberon uh and that 's kind of the aesthetics that we could go through again as i said before the other options that 's not something that 's going in in our imagination in regards to how the layouts that we 've explained before can be um developed just as a little note when we were talking about the different way of using the functions rooms that 's kind of what we 're talking about we 're talking that it can be used as a single auditorium it can be used as a big big big functions event uh room and then different ways of that we can subdivide so it can be a small auditorium with some kind of little events pilates gym more kind of a round table symposium a typical kind of classroom and more kind of practice lecture element that there 's a bit of tables where people can be using it um while somebody 's talking um i i don 't know kieran if you want to say sorry i kind of uh took the entire yeah a lot in a short amount of time then but um there is questions available as well but i suppose a bit more on the costs simon um might be able to climb in here to meet the brief exactly as we got it from the stakeholders those options did come back over budget we 've we 've looked at the priorities of that brief and come up with those three options which are all teating around the budget number high level fingers figures at this stage obviously because we haven 't got detailed documentation but yeah simon you maybe can add to the costume yeah um i guess do you want me to bring up the page from the cost report for those at the meeting or have you seen that within the um submission and are happy to to leave it at that you all do have the cost report in front of us questions on it but i have it here should we open it up for questions then okay councilman kevin um i 've got rather a lot so i don 't know if councillor gibbons would like to go first or councilman thank you um note that the fit-out works don 't include the shelving and i assume soft furnishings for areas like the reading room sorry reading rooms and sure um where that would be budgeted but i 'm assuming that that would have to be funded by oberon council independently of the grant on the basis that the budgets for each of the options are close to three well at the moment they 're over three million is that correct do you have any idea option option one was um under three million um i think forty it includes a construction contingency and it 's three two three eight three eight four with the contingency for construct with the ten percent construction contingency of two hundred fifty thousand sorry did you hear that simon did you hear the question uh i thought that question was answered by um gary just said sorry i can i can throw some light on the fit out the fit out is not included in this ground there are infrastructure grants available we get an allowance every year from the state library and that 's where it 's presumed that the fit-out cost funding would it all be paid for by one of those fit-out grants that 's what i 'm questioning because what the fit out 's going to be at this point in time this is just the concept design but that 's where it 's envisioned that the fit out costs will come from okay so we would have to somehow fund that independently the design contingency of 242 554 is in addition to the professional fees which i assume incorporate the design phase is that right why is the design contingency so high the design contingency is so high at this stage because we are only at concept stage we need to do a lot more work to refine the design and get some unknowns and make them more certain so industry standard is that you try and allow about 10 uh design contingency as well as your 10 construction when you get to that so what level of design fees have been included within the professional fees uh the professional fees um again industry standard for this uh value of job um it normally works out to be around four percent architectural fees four per ten four percent uh other professional services fees and four percent project management in the cost plan at this stage i understand that um and they 're figures i 'm aware of but i i 'm not i 'm not aware of such a high design contingency but this when we 've already allowed for four percent for design so you say well it doesn 't that that design contingency is not just to cover extra fees for the architect or the design team it 's to cover to cover um you know additional construction um costs that are not known in the building at this stage so they they will be or may or may not be absorbed by wanting to do something nicer to the facade or something some features in the ceiling or some nicer finishes in tiles that type of thing okay but with all of those fees counted up and including a construction contingency the pricing is varies between 3.238 for option a to 3.390 for option 3a which includes the construction contingency and the design we checked with council and we were we agreed that we didn 't need to include the construction contingency in that uh 's just under and one option that 's just over and the total new construction is is you know over by the largest amount that 's the general manager then where does the 250 000 come from the construction contingency where are we taking that from or where are we getting that money from um through the chair that would be something that council will resolve when they get uh that they 're happy with okay at this point in time a spread of options have been provided to council for their consideration as part of putting the qs together there 's been a contingency place in there for a number of things as outlined by coffee and that would need to be considered as part of detailing the design in which council prefer going from what i understand from coffee they 're saying that their project cost is based on the fact that council itself will wear the 250 000 outside the grant that 's what i 'm understanding that 's what they say their instructions were is that correct that is my understanding i have i didn 't contingency or that that was anticipated when we went out to the coffees at this stage that 's what i 'm saying noting councils that you already have that money reserved as part of the ongoing process in the hub development okay now that money that you 've preserved as part of that okay that 's where it 's coming from i 'm happy with that actually it 's 320. so some of that could pay for the fit up um if i could go to can i just make there could be a number of things within this to pay for the failure once again depending on the option that is preferred by council in this instance so if i could please go to the assumptions and clarifications which is 2.2 um and it 's on page they 're not page numbers thank you um the third bullet point says we 've included provisional sum allowance of 5000 for contaminated material however the exclusions exclude disposal of contaminated in-ground material so are you saying the 5000 is for everything but the disposal of it it 's for the removal what 's that mean uh the difference is the disposal of contaminated in-ground material so that 's material actually in ground that we may come across that we 're not aware of at the moment the allowance that we have included is for the removal of asbestos that is on council 's known asbestos register so there are a couple of eaves and things a small amount low risk materials that we 've allowed for removal safely before we do any further demolition or any further work and the fourth bullet point external walls have been assumed to be lightweight external walls with colour bond cladding or similar can you give us examples of what you mean the lightweight external walls will be noting that if option 1a or 2a is taken up in relation to existing buildings they are basically brick so um an option three is obviously a new build completely but let 's look let 's look at 1a and 2a what are you assuming that the lightweight external walls will be constructed of you can give us several options examples yeah so examples of that is so a lot of our walls um new walls any new walls can be lightweight still rather than the thicker structural steel we believe that we could do that and for costing purposes we 've allowed for the cladding material to be colorbond so it is quite cost effective but we can still the architects can still work it to make it look quite nice and in that point as well we 've also assumed for cost purposes that any new walls could be roughly 50 windows but again that 's uh details that are still to be worked through post this concept stage so if we were to match in with existing building structures which are brick that would be more expensive uh well the architects tell us um that when you 're doing old against new um it 's not a good idea to try and match and blend it in because you you may not ever achieve that perfect match so making it deliberately different is what they recommend and that is what we 've kind of looked at and priced so it would be if it buildings they 're similar brick color we would be kind of matching and merging the two of those if you can recall that render with our new building connecting the two um that would look new on the outside however you know everything on the inside would obviously look new and all freshly painted yeah not just to chime in there obviously we 're at the concept stage and it was a starting point to be able to establish some high level costs it could be a combination of some lightweight walls and lightweight cladding there could be a combination of some other masonry as well if that becomes a more cost-effective way to work with the structural design that would come with this project which obviously we don 't have at this point the lightweight walls mentioning in this mentioned in this um uh report also refer to the fact that we 're not looking at heavy masonry structural walls at all uh single story it 's a lightweight roof so we could use stud framework to hold up our new elements whether it 's option one two or a lightweight cladding whether it 's a painted material or it 's a color bond or something else would work in with the three forms that we 're looking at in terms of the planning but very early days and i suppose structural design and other elements would impact this but it 's an allowance now that probably without without sounding like a quantity surveyor um these aren 't probably huge elements in terms of uh costs waving if one wall ended up being a brick wall or a big veneer wall or something it 's probably not going to um make huge differences to the overall budget it 's just a starting point to be able to get some rates there 's a design contingency in there which we talked about which can go up and down depending on if you take away or add on to it so the 50 the ex the the glazing the new glazing is single glazed double glazed triple glazed double glazed with the existing roofs if option 1a or 2a is taken up will that involve internal roof gutterings noting the issues gullies that are in over-existing roof lines that are will require a gutter potentially um we 've noted that in our in the presentation it says it 's one of the constraints of dealing with existing buildings there 's a few dealing with existing buildings but you 're right in the fact that existing roof lines and existing pitches and guttering does become complicated again it 's um we try and avoid it at all at all when we can but there is potential that with the um option one especially with the two roof lines that we 're working with that there would need to be some internal um box gutters and things uh associated with the design and they could have problems in snow areas in particular well we would look at all those type of loads to make sure that the structure is uh strong enough to to carry any of those potential snow loads that 's right the next thing is i know this is there going to be any fixed shelving in the library or it 's all going to be um considered as um kind of uh to to keep the budget looked at you know reusing a lot of that type of loose furniture and fittings as possible but there is the option um you know budget permitting to um to look at additional or new uh items for the library fit out or elsewhere um so nothing 's been apart from trying to or allowing to reuse existing nothing 's been selected yet just um budget allocated in relation to the top bullet point on the next page for the 20kw solar power system um has a cost-benefit analysis been looked at that in relation to um the benefits to council over say a five to ten well having looked at this recently in relation to building work in relation to a three to seven year period um the benefits in relation to reduced power and and a payback period for that and is it separately cost into getting rebates from the government if that 's able to be achieved by council uh that level of detail we have not gone into yet but we know of you know similar sized buildings budget allows will i 'd always um endorse doing as much sold that we can fit but we have not kind of done the cost benefit cost benefit analysis to determine that we need an x amount size to cater for the expected power load from the use of the buildings okay um in relation to the next bullet point where you look at the esd initiatives i would have thought that one of the esd initiatives would have been the double glazing and uh you 're right that could have been added to that point but um it is it is included double glazing what in relation to esd what insulation in well i suppose it depends on the cladding um but are you looking at r5 insulation on on walls and ceilings uh i don 't know the exact rating but um you know there 's enough allowance in there to to do a high spec insulation um that 'll be uh selected in that kind of detailed design phase and obviously it would be looked at the uh the location of oberon being you know those potentially in sydney um so the nominal allowance of 1500 for small appliances um it says it does not cover the cost of special small appliances such as coffee machines what does it color uh it covers like microwaves kettles um toaster those type of smaller appliances um the selection of a coffee machine if you 're a coffee drinker yeah there 's so many to choose from it can be quite quite a task in itself just a growing a coffee machine and sorry if i can go into the exclusions um the third last one where it says long service levy so does that mean that in including your costings for construction you have not included the council 's contribution to the building worker or construction workers long service levy that 's that 's correct that 's correct uh those those type of fees have been excluded as well as the kind of council da fees as well you 've got authorities fees in your budget which i noticed for each of the you 've got um where was it oh sorry there is a little bit isn 't the council d.a as well but it 's not it 's for others no i did so you are right it is council da fees but um the the last point there if there 's any other outside of that council developer internal management fees that 's not included service levy fee on the construction fees how much what percentage isn 't that normal uh from memory it 's only a small percent or one and a half percent but at this stage we don 't have a firm construction fee so we wouldn 't be able to put a price on that yet i understand that but we have a budget for construction see okay um in the option 1a costing breakdown which is this document um item 4.02 is after hours i 'm assuming that 's the after hours access which is basically the entrance to the robert hooper center as it exists now and modifications to that to make it after hours accessible is that right for six thousand yes that would be for kind of um you know after hours accessible um access so if it door that type of after hours access okay so so the authority fees i was talking about are the fifth lie fifth row from the bottom of that page which i think was for option a 29 108 yeah um i think that would also need to to cover any of the um uh water services fees etc okay thank you very much that 's all my questions thank you forgiveness said the chair i just have one question with option three i don 't know whether you can get the slide back up or not but uh i think we spoke about it before but it 's the lack of building to the north to uh catch the sun i mean and winters here are eight months and i thought on option 3 showed it fairly well but the building to me i guess it 's the nature of the block it doesn 't allow to really capture the sun the light of the sun and uh it just makes the place area but you might be able to explain it better down here it seems to be facing can build to the north it 's a no-brainer to talk about that uh one of the things that we 've considered with the option three is also the usage of skylights so uh although it 's true that there 's no window drawn in this scheme from the north we were we were thinking that one of the options could be to have uh skylights and on the top that could bring light into the into the room in a modern way and also although it 's not drawn in the concept drawing in the design there 's that shouldn 't really be much of a problem to actually have some kind of a high window catching the sun from this facade yes i just think that one needs more consideration yeah because just moves in the northern sky all day from for six months of the of the year and it just gives a place an airy feeling a lighter feeling and uh less costly unless there 's another way because otherwise you could have lights going on inside all day definitely yeah uh thank you i have two and you did mention it this evening um in bringing the surfaces together um my personal preference would be a holder that we virtually render all brickwork to try to unify um whatever it is we end up if we end up choosing a building uh you you did say this evening that you did not think that would be a significant cost is that sad um i said that changing the wall type on some of the walls from a lightweight cladding to potentially a masonry could be a less significant cost and some other changes in terms of the changing of the design i suppose the other point to make is at this point in this conceptual point which we 're up to conceptual design things like do we render one of the buildings do we leave the other one brick do we do we do brick veneer for the for the new sections i suppose those those options in terms of the um the finer detail of a selected option in a schematic design and then develop design and then and then actual working drawings there different options at this stage we 've thrown an idea out that is mainly around planning admittedly we just wanted to see how we can get these spaces to work around the constraints of existing in new the materiality does need another round or two of refinement um and looking at those options the advantages how it works with structure how it works with even even where windows are we just talked about where the north is and things so there is another round or two um definitely a design iteration but um just as a general note i think if we if we had proposed to render and paint all existing brick work i think it could have been something that got stripped out when we went over budget because rendering and painting all of the new bricks all of the existing bricks would be a costly costly exercise and ongoing maintenance and things yeah in terms of painting the whole the whole um the whole new new and existing building potentially may not be a good cost-effective thing to do but again there 's probably more options there to explore in terms of materials finishes and form um i appreciate all that that 's why i 'm getting in early how much exposed brick wall is there internally in any of these designs nothing proposed at this point it could be but nothing yeah nothing set in stone there thank you any other comments counselor i just want to make a comment about the exclusions you said the exclusion is commercial commercial kitchen equipment um if this facility can cater for up to two or three hundred people you would that the regulations for a kitchen would be of commercial quality is that uh that 's not necessarily true yes your kitchen would need to be constructed with your coved skirtings and other things so that it can be easily cleaned however your equipment inside can be i guess to any level that you can afford so with our budget restrictions we looked at making sure that we had an allowance for good quality and a number of good quality large domestic appliances because we feel that this stage that would cater for the majority of of uses don 't see that the the budget would go as far as a commercial fit out kitchen in this space i think it 's also worth noting that what the hub doesn 't try to do is take over some other provision or some other facility that 's capable of doing this and a commercial kitchen would lead to having a competing interest against other properly owned options currently in the town if i am also allowed to intervening here it 's important to know that commercial kitchens as we understand them basically it 's the one that it 's in a restaurant they need higher maintenance than normal kitchens or the appliances need a different way of treating so for example it 's really fascinating to see one of these dishwashers that go into a commercial kitchen that they wash the dishes in just five minutes or less but this dishwasher needs some high maintenance every day to switch it on and switch it off so the idea here it was to give a kitchen that it 's uh usable and doesn 't require much maintenance that was one we had with the community uh we were talking about the community requires for two dishwashers but it will be residential high grade residential dishwasher not a commercial one any other questions before i go back i 'd just like to ask um i know we 're only a concert stage did they do any shooting at levels between the hooper center floor and the existing library we didn 't take any levels ourselves we used survey information provided by council um which included the library and the the hooper center um and i don 't recall the date but that was actually only in the last year or two from memory does that sound right uh us sorry yes it sounds right uh we have the we collected a fair bit of information from our own council including the original plans from the library and within the information that it was shared with us there was uh not detailed but enough for this concept level survey in which there was the consideration of the levels between the bob hopper hooper the library and some points in the surrounds that make the connections and the length for the ramps thank you last question councilman kevin thank you madame um in relation to the to the options in particular 1a and 2a the function centers function rooms have all been put on the northern side that 's correct yes and i understand that from a design point of view and fitting everything in my only concern is that the function centers won 't be used all the time whereas the library will and and one of i think the benefits of the library is it is on the northern side and does receive the sun especially in the middle of winter which can be quite nice by pushing the library back into the center of the building it won 't get that benefit and i understand that some people that if you necessarily too much sun but also it is quite nice if you 're reading a book to look up and look out occasionally so you have a view out the way up that window um was any consideration given to that aspect and the second thing is one a center atrium area as you 've suggested for option three earlier in the questions to provide more light into that area i suppose the answer is probably um yeah we answer both with uh with with one statement that yeah the second the second question you have so definitely the skylights for that the library area so with that library area the general idea would be to try and get controlled like we want to be able to ensure that we 've got indirect where possible and even light across the spaces so um while it is good to look out we we would look to incorporate windows but a window to the south in the um in a library area where you can still get a lot of direct light with large scale windows it 's actually an easy thing to deal with in terms you don 't have to stand up and walk away when it 's middle of summer and the sun 's coming in so skylights definitely to try and get even distributed light across the space even highlight windows can work in terms of having would come down to designing at the roof um looking at maybe lifting the roof in certain areas certainly in the foyer lifting a roof and looking at highlight windows there or just sort of skylights but the idea would be that that function room while not used um a lot would benefit a lot from in terms of meeting rooms and different conferences to have that northern aspect in terms of light that you don 't necessarily have to control because it 's a it 's not a controlled sort of reading environment with the same with screens people might be reading on their laptops or things in in in the library and screens don 't deal very well with direct sunlight as well but um yeah that that 's generally the idea but again that the windows letting light in controlling light that is probably part of the future um design phases and it 's just easier to control when it 's not directly to the north another benefit of of shifting the library into the other area is that it allows us to try and keep the while we do the construction works around it there 's still a lot to work through for that but that would the idea of that is that we can then almost finish the new library area and get them relocated into it and try and then continue to work around them so that they are operational throughout the the full construction thank you simon okay thank you so much for your presentation it 's gone on a wee bit longer usage um so thank you simon kieran and newest um i believe you 're leaving the meeting now but we are going to bring this um hopefully bring this item forward if you wish to um stay on for the discussion so thank you very much okay you 're welcome thank you very much thanks thank you we 're back to the normal business uh we 're on page six item seven questions from the public due to the current covert 19 pandemic and in accordance with the newly legislative state government requirements the december ordinary council meeting is being undertaken as a virtual meeting conducted using webinar facilities the must be submitted in writing prior to 1pm on tuesday the 15th of december 2020 members of the public who submit a question to council are permitted to do so provided the following guidelines are adhered to the person lodging the question must advise of their name and in what capacity they are acting but they i must advise counsel if they have prior consent or authority if acting for another person questioning questions from the public is not an opportunity for debate with elected representatives or staff it 's an opportunity for the community to ask the question in relation to an issue or put a point of view relating to an issue that may be causing interest or concern due to time constraints a time frame of three minutes per speaker is allocated the general manager will read out any questions submitted at this point in time questions will be taken on notice and response provided within a reasonable time frame to the general manager thank you madam mayor at this point in time we 've had five questions from the public that have asked today and without one is from rosalind stamby who acts by herself as a former oberon resident i regularly visit the oberlin cemetery i 've later noticed several concerning things that i want to bring to your attention i believe a cemetery should be a calm restful place somewhere that not only acts as a sign of respect for our loved ones who have passed but also somewhere to sit with someone 's memories quite contemplation however is not possible at the oberon cemetery as there are reeds going around graves and gardens the rose garden is unkept and the niche wall is dusty and not maintained as well as being overgrown and uns with unsightly weeds there is only one water tank to service the entire cemetery this is old and difficult to use furthermore there is insufficient seating and the distinct lack of shade there are not enough bins to dispose of rolling flowers and the bins that are there go unempty for long periods of time i 've also noticed some things that i believe are not safe i 've seen council staff driving mowers and earth moving equipment carelessly addition to this there are large rocks rabbit holes and a tree stump close to the niche wall which i believe would provide prove to be a dangerous tripping hazard at the lawn cemetery crown it is uneven some graves have large amounts of earth while some have subsided leaving large divots in the earth this is upsetting unsightly and dangerous i think council needs to address these issues i think it 's important to remember that there are many of the graves contain the people who built over on the planners the landowners and the characters without whom we would not have a town of of today but not maintaining their resting place show them the lack of respect as you would be aware the cemetery is of great historical significance not only oberon but the central west with some sites dating back to the 1800s perhaps these issues could be resolved through heritage grants a work for the dole program involvement of local schools of correctional facilities i feel that a beautification landscaping plan would greatly enhance this area i would like to acknowledge the fantastic work by plaques on previously unmarked growth throughout the cemetery the long hours of sorting through old records and identifying the sizes to be committed the newly completed tar roads and signage are great additions to the oberon cemetery i 'm sure many many residents would like to congratulate oberon council for the added functionality and accessibility this has provided unfortunately the new tarots don 't always doesn 't take away the unkept ugliness of the cemetery after a little investigation of another cemetery in the central west i 've spoken to ground keeping staff about council 's commitment to make the area beautiful restful and a wonderful kept area yes this is bathus i feel you need to take a drive to the batter cemetery the air is beautiful the grass cut shaded areas plenty of garbage bins seating for reflecting and beautiful landscaping the whole area is very well kept and the running flowers are disposed of by staff a month after the burial thank you the second one is from hardy draham who is commenting on the hub business paper attachment 1301 with particular focus on the server i following points ought to be considered in the decision making process by councils firstly the consultant had two distinctly different surveys in use while the questions of both online and hardcopy versions were the same the possible answers were not this required both survey options to be modified during the analysis to accommodate the differences only the hard copy version was included in the report the online version was omitted presumably to avoid highlighted and obvious differences the survey being manipulated after the results are in the requiring the answers to be changed to fit the questions does not pass the pub test it does not if the intent was the same manipulating a survey once the results have been collated is an admission that the initial survey design was unprofessional and not fit for purpose secondly page six declares the online survey is limited to one survey per device this is incorrect model responses were easily easily possible from one pc this is a well-known floor of the software putting the validity of the survey into doubt the same line of reasoning applies to the collation of hard copy of the library and the council changes thirdly page 16 declares all comments from both the online and hard copy surveys listed this is also not correct a number of comments have been excluded putting the validity of the survey into doubt it is disappointing that after widespread publicity only 127 responses were at hand a public meeting may all have brought about a different scenario many residents expressing their views verbally without necessarily completing a survey basing large facing such large investment and future operating costs on 76 equaling 96 respondents saying what it strikes me right strikes me as rather dangerous 41 percent of online responses disagreed with dart street whereas 86 of the hard copy respondents said agree the survey did not explain why there is such a significant bias towards both survey methods the similarities to the src flew right survey are obvious parts of the community are split which in the past made councils maintain the status quo rather than focusing on the decision such obvious bias between online and hard copies should ring alarm bells for councils the opinions for alternate locations so the dart street site clc black springs malachi and rsl are nothing but a smoke screen the vast majority of users of the library slash community center would arrive by car using the 600 meter distance to reject the vic site or to have been followed up with an analysis showing how many visitors actually arrived by foot the distance from town to the off leash area brought about the statement most people drive there anyway so distance doesn 't matter why is the hub any different parking residential streets around the fitness center is already impacting nearby residents the cost of all these and auxiliary services must be included in the business case showing the overall cost in prior to council is voting uh thank you mr dragheim 's opinion is notion the third one is from uh mr hardy drawham on behalf of ozra dear gary there are two administrative issues i would like to share with you and bring your attention both relating to statements made in the november council meeting regarding murky water issue pap space could be addressed at the december meeting council staff responded to the seaweed manganese iron filtration plant and the failed surface water harvesting project it was alleged the 50 capacity increase was not done due to the harvesting project not eventuating relevant screenshots show that firstly osra did not make any such connection the suggestion was made by staff our submission did not mention this project at all the response to the mayor asking if there was indeed a connection resulting in the affirmative response by yourself appears to have been mistaken you may wish to correct this for the councils who appeared to have been given incorrect information based on some vague memory of staff who were not even present the seaweed plant was installed in 2001 long before the surface water harvesting project on the was on the table after extremely low dam levels in 2010 causing great concern plants like the z-wave filtration plant are usually conceptualised catering for future capacity increases if required documents from the council meetings confirmed the project scope by lee robbins in june 2010 neither yourself having commenced in 2011 question mark mars scheduled or senior staff were involved at that stage the mention anywhere that the surface water around us was to be pumped to the seaweed plant the 200 mega liter a year were to be collected in a pond in queen street pumped or pond near albion street packaged with a standalone treatment plant before being pumped at the timber complex the gulp course expressed the desire to obtain the water this appears to be only after the federal and state grants were obtained council solicited the otc for quantitative and quality of the expectations under gmail and carnegie in 2012. only current council zenday claude mccarthy and kerry gibbons were in the chambers during that period the project was closed by council staff claiming adverse financial impact after the election been bringing a change of direction the surface water harvesting project had no impact on inbuilt 50 design capacity margin of the seaweed system apart from faulty memories it defies logic to pump 200 mega liters from the st from the wtp it always also defines logic to filter it for ion and manganese without either having it tested for actual water quality during the soaping scoping stage or records showing such points were considered secondly deputy mayor kellum announced on november 17 that the residents connected to the wr the rws will receive a four percent repeat unless ozra is mistaken there is not a motion before council that makes the decision or or any public debates to explain why this rebate is being offered and how the figure of 4 comes about the topic discussed in november council closed session item 1601 did not bring about a statement by the mayor added to the zoom recording after closed session ended and ozra would expect that expect to be the proper process the mooded report explaining the facts and analysis for the quantitative rebates by staff promised for the december meeting has yet to be made public a further announcement was made by mayor statuettes in our weekly news in on the 26th of november osborough believes council statues and deputy mayor callum released information discussed in close section without being any reference to or the decision or authorization to release it to the public you may wish to ensure that council records are corrected as required as mr ray hines opinion is noted um the fourth uh question or comment comes from who wish to make comment on the hub business paper and speaks only on the financials the indoor fitness center commenced with a 500k grant in 2018 and opened in october 2020 for a total outlay of almost 1 million dollars is unclear how council complied with the present policy where sources of fund for the project must be identified before it could be put for councillors for decision not yet approved grants do not count as source of funds for the commitment of expenditure the hub design options are high level concept only and the project costing is provisional though i note that even at its early stage the project is above 3.1 million approved grant funding i understand that the main grant provisions included that no further grants would be forthcoming atlas group lists a range of cost uncertainties and costs that have been excluded to give a flavor of the issues such such things as loose furnishings including library shelving is not included norris cctv or av equipment nor is price level is provided for upgrades of the site services based on previous independent work on combining the hooper and library i suspect the cost of stitching two old buildings in option 1a and 2a and the groundwork for services for 3a are underestimated cost of service distributions during the construction is not included coffee correctly notes of that sufficient public and private meeting space already exists to cover needs literacy inclined will continue to avail themselves and neil costa obram of the collections at the bathus library council 's code of meeting practices requires that all funding for projects be identified and declared before a binding decision is made by the councils to commit the expenditure such funds need to be adequate to enable functional completion of the project and must all include all incremental costs associated with the project the council proposes to go to tender in april 2021 to responsibly develop a proposal from the concept stage to the tender stage requires that a detailed architectural work and engineering design are completed in a process involves key milestones for costing checking to assure acceptable financial costs and design outcomes and 75 of documentation plus detailed pre-tender cost estimates this will ensure the project is viable and that all cost projects including all out-of-contract expenses are accounted for apart from the fact that council has personally fidiciously responsibilities for spending money it is also unethical for council to go to builders and contractors where ensuring that adequate funds are available to commit to the project considering how much work needs to be done by reputable tenders to give a binding response while not project costs per say councils should also look at their decisions to include consideration of incremental annual operating expenditure following from implementation of the project thank you mr savik 's opinions are also noted the final question from the public comes from the o 'connell valley community group um the o 'connell valley community group would like to ask council why a modification to da 2010 2007 132-4 ruler coded proposed lot 2 of a subdivision was only notified to adjacent land owners and not all land owners bordering the four properties of the d8 this is not this is not a new da but a modification the day da should receive a notice question one can council provide a list of landowners addresses that receive notification and what process was used to determine notification of all to all parties the modification application asked for the application to be considered under section 5 4.55 1a of the environment planning assessment act and is considered to be a minimal environmental impact on the basis that the modification is essentially the same as the development and the consent was granted in 2007. question two the modification an owner is relying on the epa act and we would ask why the modifications not being considered under the updated over on lep 2013. um this will be taken on notice and reported back to the group with the adequate response thank you now go to item eight confirmation of minutes counsellors recognization is the next of the ordinary meeting held on the 17th of november 2020 be confirmed could i have a move replace how 's the cable in a segment accounts for filming any business arising i have submit matters but they 'll come up in the appropriate section later minutes be accepted harry thank you and i have a mover that we bring forward item 1301 from page 22 please counselor callum and the second are councilman thank you item 1301 reports for decision open community home there is a recommendation there that council approved concept design option option for progression to stage two and the council will nominate the open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 166 bracket a of the local government regulation 2005 the stage 2 design and construct i would like to put forward an alternate motion that council approved concept design option 1a for progression to stage 2. the council nominate the open tendering method as described in accordance with clause 166a of the local government regulation 2005 to stage two design and construction three but council placed the preferred option on public exhibition until the end of january do i have a second up thank you councilman i 'd like to speak to the motion it 's my view that one a meets the brief that we 've given to copy and the architect as far as cost is concerned demolition to the demolishing of the community centre which was not popular with the community in the community survey the space in option 1a appears to be adequate to needs and i 've talked to the librarian about this and several members of the community i think that the to the preference preferred option needs to be placed on public exhibition before moving to stage two the design and construct stage for the benefit of our community to have a look and a further opportunity to comment the design and construct phase is when details can be decided upon smaller details we have to be aware councillors that the timeline completion of this project project is mid-2022 then my reasons for the alternate motion council dhoni you have something to do um first off for the public exhibition i think i raised that last meeting i 'm very pleased that the public gets another look at this i know it will invite a strong comment but um i 'm also aware that the balance of that comment is constructive and in support of this project so it 's good for people about it as for the design itself i i did wrestle significantly with between one and two one does try to tie together existing buildings and i hope we can make that attractive externally i think we can particularly raising the issue of uh trying to blend the external surfaces and also on all these statistics it gives us the most bang for the buck in terms of square meter each uh i think it sticks down a little bit on the library but i think it 's up on one of the other key ones so i think on balance when you match that with cost as well i 'm very pleased to support your motion thank you madam um i also support all three sections of the motion and you put forward i think option 1a is within the current budget i think the issues of the design contingency construction contingency and also the fact that there 's 250 000 set aside within those within the concept design for landscaping gives us a reasonable amount of room to move and noting this is the concept design there is the basis of 1a we will probably end up i think with a good functional and attractive design um i like the two former speakers um support the three aspects of the recommendations you 've proposed um as has been stated um i think we get the best bang for the dollar for option 1a um but also i think with appropriate as i indicated i 'm a little worried about the light aspect because i think one aspect of the library at the moment facing north is that in winter you do get some sun into it um and i am slightly concerned that the library is now sort of moved towards the southeastern end a little however leaving that aside i also like the concept of 1a in that unlike 2 a you don 't have a right angle in the foyer what we 've got in 1a around the library is the center passage but it 's more like an atrium and i think it 's going to be much more inviting to walk into from fleming street or the corner of fleming street and dart street here to the main street i think that 's going to be much better with a straight through area and i think maybe we put some we look at the skylights in the area because i think that 's going to be a very appealing atrium when i looked at the second option 2a i actually didn 't like the right angle in it i thought it was going it 's it 's not going to have the light coming in both ends i don 't think it 's going to be as attractive the areas only area had concern and i raised it in my questions was i 'm always a bit scared about from an engineering perspective about box gutters and joining roofs because especially where you have a snow load it 's a weak point in a building if there 's deluges of rain the box cutters can often leak i think that 's only one aspect we have to look at carefully because um from experience i know that it can always be a weak point in the building and if there 's an overflow of middle of the building and cause damage so you have to look at that carefully um and we do have two relatively good serviceable buildings i think and i would commend the the actives i think what they 've done there is good i agree with councillor doni in that i think we do have to be careful about the finishes on the external parts of the building and ensuring blending um and as it 's done appropriately i 'm not a great supporter of colorbond walls i have to say i know we 're trying to blend two buildings together and often something new as they 've said is good because you 're not trying to match either but i do think we maybe should look a little bit more carefully at the materials we use for doing that option three i know it is it looks like a state-of-the-art building but i also looked at it and i 've looked at sort of building similar sometimes these type of buildings date quite quickly and we have to be careful of that i think certainly that option 1a it budget definitely the community survey indicated that um they could see no reason to sort of knock down the existing two buildings i think maybe with a 1a option because you 're keeping the existing buildings it will end up that we may use more of our construction and design contingency than we may with a completely new building but i think we have to wear that um and i think there may be in other work in other areas cost savings that we we can can make i don 't know if when this is outside this brief as to whether any of the furnishings from the existing library can be reused but we certainly need to look at that um i think on the costs savings i think um and i have had some experience with this recently with supermarkets um we were able to we are able to pay back um putting solar cells on two supermarkets within two years total cost and that 's because running refrigeration and freezers big uses of electricity during the day this building is going to be used predominantly during the on on the necessity for it are going to be during the day which means you can have direct feed into the building so there 's usually cost savings where you can use that direct feed if you can 't direct feed it 's questionable whether the savings are there with with solar but anyway that can be looked at further down the track when more details are looking looked at but yes madam mayor i 'd support your three recommendations thank you councilman any other comments councillors councillor gibbons yes i support the design option 1a i don 't think that the bob hoover center is a lot higher and i can see in the foyer ramping up and running across there so you you have a split level effect and i think that 'd be great i 've seen it in other buildings and i just think it 'll work well in there so i 'm supporting that thank you council that 's mccarthy um i 'm just wondering in part of the system can we make the brief that we keep the box gutters and that to water 's going to come in this building with the skylights and things like that and books and all that are in their computers and it happens you 've only got to get a half storm your gut is blocked up and the water comes in so your brief is the stupidness to your roof it should be part of a brief that they should be looking at for us thank you any other comments have some kidney yes excuse me i support the three recommendations and i think option one basically the best um because it 's the closest to our budget for a start but uh i also like to um just speak a little bit more on council mccarthy 's option in the box recommendation for the box cutters um i 've had a lot of experience with them in the engineering manager from a lot of the big buildings in town and they 've all got box cutters okay supermarket the old golf club which is now the bed and breakfast the rsl club all the factories over here everywhere there 's a change in level on large buildings so we should avoid them at all costs in 2021 there is no need for it if there 's a if there 's a difference in levels in the roof there it 's quite a simple thing to do an umbrella type atrium over the top and use that as your gutter around and take away the split level roof use a split level route as a feature as councillor given said it can be an architectural feature that does have any functionality i think we need to be extremely careful that we that we 're right on them on the design of that that 's the only concern i have with with option one i can see it being an insurance disaster down the track so too many times and the only way to do it is to go over the top of the truck i just did it at my home home sort of a complete new roof with larger trusses over the top because when i extended i put split level so they didn 't want to box out we have a trust company council of cuba and council mccarthy 's uh points that we uh you need to be very diligent in the design i 'm sure if our architect and project people are listening to this which i think they are they 'll take that on board okay counselors if there 's another comment i 'm going to put just just what do they plan to divide these petitions with uh internationally yes are they solid doors that will come out in the design and construct stage okay it 's just um interesting to know how they 're going to facilitate it you just can 't have a curtain and the things still function that 's that 's what i 'm getting at can we take that on notice and get an answer for your council well yeah we need to because other than that those three spaces become nothing as well i 'm going to put the recommendation counsellors all in favor of the recommendation three parts carried unanimously thank you we now go back to our normal business paper we 're on page six six merrell minute item 90901 there information can i have a mover please help someone my counselor another busy month for you and i took on board your uh direction to counsellors and asked any questions uh before the meeting you did thank you councillor kevin um no madame

councillor kellum actually attended that event not myself is there any other comments counselors the council of capital has left more room for me that 's a good thing just quickly um galloping gun are they connected to a way forward for our place central issue at all they are connected a little yes they are okay and the community garden continent twenty-fifth and that are meeting general lawrence what 's the progression of that november um we have a community member um that would like to facilitate a community garden near where she lives and counselor lion and i went down to visit her to find 're going to get back to her with some information in the new year and um just can you give us any information on the correspondence of the 13th of november roland brunton into relation to development compliance issues this was a um correspondence from the bruntons um pointing out where they did not think comfortable will combine their training laws and can you tell us what is there what is there any further activity in that space um can i afford you the letter i believe this matters in court okay thank you very much thank you line did you have something i was just going to mention about that visit with janelle lawrence um excuse me i 'll take that to the garden club also and i 've looked at the map of the area and i don 't think it 's really suitable and i think our problem here in oberon is most people have a garden but i might look at building janella garden okay so when we go back to her thank you any other comments here the recommendation all in favor marriage unanimously thank of motions item 11 1101 council and delegates reports local government new south wales annual conference the recommendation if the report is received as information can i have a mover class councilman kevin thank you and councillor johnny thank you obviously the commentary on the um new south wales conference or local government which is very important and i moved the recommendation he accepted thank you councilman what 's the um criteria of the ar blue awards the ar blue red awards are for s3 isn 't it they 're for achievement in local government there are criteria around it i haven 't got it in my head just at the moment but i can certainly give you the information do you remember more sure i can give a brief overview and it 's um councils can nominate themselves to be part of that there is a number of uh requirements that you need to meet in applying um you apply yourself and a number of people who represent the blue trust look at those submissions and um allocate a winner based on those submissions received for round achievement i i can certainly afford them if you 're interested i think it 's something that that we should look at because it 's a prestigious award you get to sign up at the entry to town i think we should um consider nominating another sign any other comments on this one councillors we 've only just gotten used to put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 12 item 1102 upper macquarie county council meeting the recommendation is there that report item 1102 is procedures information a mover please councilman kevin and christopher cable thank you councilman oh a very extensive report with my colleague thousand okay two meetings what are you saying i had a long one any other comment council councillor gibbons yeah just so the chair likes to comment uh it 's very informative and uh i think good things are happening there and uh we 're well represented and there 's movement there i would if i could just make a comment if anyone is interested in the chilean needle grass i think the the um field day on the 7th of december at 9 well worth going to the identification of this weed is very hard if you actually drive in bathurst you will know bits of it all around the city and i think it 's only a matter of time before it ends up in this area and the identification of it is particularly hard and it will cause significant damage to our sheep industry in particular the fat lamb industry it penetrates the skin of sheep and can cause infection and make the it 's a really it 's a it 's a nasty uh um it 's a nasty uh weed and the other comments on this one councillors recommendation all in favor item 1103 central new south wales joint organization board meeting 4th of december 2020 the recommendation is that the report item be received as information can i have a mover please come forgiveness thank you council kellum thank you councillor gibbons through the chair no that 's good reading i just seen the bottom of page 15 with them murray darling basin authority could be visiting our region we 're trying to catch up with it we can go so keep you abreast of that and on the next page near the notes we 're talking about the intermodal is that train and road road or train from they 're talking there or both oh transport links um this was mostly train that they were discussing at this meeting yes i thought the place was a bit quick and road it was it does cover road as well the one hour from the new airport to disco everybody thought was a little bit um far-fetched um but anyway it was an interesting interesting talk yeah what was that comment their aim of this group is to establish a high-speed one-hour link between the new western sydney airport and lisco in one hour can be done so it 's a combination and it 's a group of businessmen that are trying to promote this and they 're looking for council 's support to put business cases together and do research and things like that thank you you might like the amount of paper sorry you might like to give them our paper yes yeah that 's about him paul tool and i 'm not sure if i read it here or in the attached minutes um that they 're looking at obviously the great western highway and we 've looked at the tunnel under black heath and i think the community in black heath has said that they want the long time which is four and a half kilometers from what i understand and that will make a significant difference and obviously part of the road is a new um ascent of the blue or i said decent of the blue mountains that circumvents mount victoria um but also i note that there the comment about the hundred kilometer bells line of wade bells road and i 'm assuming that means from the m7 all the way through to lithgow 100 kilometers they 're going to try and make is that right how are they going to go through carriage on areas like that that was how i read it no i don 't think that 's the case they were talking about securing uh entry in on the hawke spring to the bells line yeah securing land really can 't recall that but i would go back to my notes but do you recall council callum i was pretty clear at the time that he was talking about literally the beltline road establishment but not the carriage on road or windsor road or any of those other ones so starting at the build around the bilping a different link onto the bells line of road than that one so its plans run away from 100 kilometer limit length of the bells line of road safety upgrades are underway including overtaking loans that 's current currently then you overtaking lanes being installed i haven 't seen you lately it 's what he told us that they 're underway i haven 't been doing that lately um three weeks ago i didn 't think i 've seen it maybe you can bring a report back and we can question perhaps you were traveling too far a lot of the speed limits have gone down 18. yes uh any other questions on this one i 'll put the recommendation all in favor committee reports counselors on page 18 item 1201 council received the report item as information the council approved the oberon youth council hold one meeting per year in varaga black springs and o 'connell villages and that counts that the oberon youth council meetings be held on the fourth tuesday each month at 6 00 p.m can i have a move to please councillor cable and the second council thank you the reason behind this is that firstly the moving the meetings to the tuesday extended wednesday was because it suited more of the people there 's a couple of them got jobs and um can 't come on on wednesdays and um they agreed that um to have a meeting in the villages um would be good it 's going to be a long way for them to go down to burrito but anyway um because there are a number of their peers who who live out in the villages who don 't have the opportunity to to come into town at that time of day to attend the meetings and and the activities of the youth council i think it 's very interesting that the council 's the way it is so um i hope the council does approve um i think the initiative to hold meetings in the villages once a year is an excellent initiative supported wholeheartedly um thank you very much i think the um in the involvement of the youth council in the community hub and their opinions on it and um getting quite excited about it i think is really really good and i think uh councillor kapoor and the youth council for getting really behind that yeah i might say on that mayor if i may that that um we had a a really good um session we had a had a zoom meeting with the these fellas um zoomed in to the um youth council meeting and uh there 's some some very good discussion and some a lot of good ideas from the youth councillors about sort of things that they would like to see in in the in the youth area um i think it was very productive and and i applaud the the way that the fellows handled it too because they asked some really good young people out they were a bit slow to get started but there was some some very good discussion good thank you any other comments come to us with the recommendation all in favor aye thank you page 25 councillors 1302 audited 2019-20 financial statements the recommendation is that council placed the audited 2019 financial statements on public display for 28 days from the 17th of december 2020. anova please counselor kellum thank you this is pretty straightforward it is a procedural process where we 're resolving here but i would note i 'm very pleased that staff uh resisted the move by the office to not have the understanding council 's financial statements page removed i think having that in there making financial statements more understandable for everyone is a is an excellent idea i agree thank you yes i i implored that i i don 't know why um they would have asked the understanding council council 's financial statements partly removed i 'm also questioning why they wanted the notes contained in the statements and removed because my understanding of financial account is the notes are as that council should general manager maybe should be directed to ask the audit office in a letter why why this was necessary i think we should approve the financial accounts but no problem with that but i just think a question as to why because normal company accounts and everything else always have notes today they 're really important could the director possibly assist with with an explanation um through you madame no there was no explanation provided from the audit office happy to follow up with their um prior to their presentation in february i think we should ask for written reasons if you could get it because it doesn 't make sense to me you weren 't present so yeah any other questions or comments on this one given in the right area just on page 70 just an observation that our water rates is it that uh we 've made about eight hundred and seventy six thousand are you in the attractions counselling yeah the ordered financial statement is that right that there was a profit made on water rates per year did you hear that the it 's not profit that 's exactly that 's the income that was received whatever income we have that goes back into the restricted for that fund just on page 44 of the of the attachments i know it 's a defeating a drum but i think every time we 've looked at financial statements i know there are multiple legislative and contractual restrictions on the general manager um but uh you know they leave provisions that the uh and even though by uh when last time we asked the auditor the auditor said that you know they 're within reasonable standards across councils still feel it is something that we should be constantly diligent in attempting to reduce that viability as far as we can thank you councillor and i support the question on notes i mean often really some of the more important stuff is that in the numbers so i find that quite odd thank you i 'll put the recommendation counselors all in favor page 26 item 1303 development application 10.2020.73.1 single story dwelling with attached garage the recommendation is that council vary part c.5.5 of to development application one zero 2020.73.1 for construction of a single story dwelling with attached garage at lot 13 in dp double one three nine four zero four being known as nine stevenson close oberon and that a division be called in accordance with section three seven five a of the local government h 1993. can i have a mover please council mckinney thank you and a second to please councils also given thank you council mccann did you wish to speak to the recommendation uh yes madame um i um i support the building the health surveyor 's recommendation that the variation be approved the block is even though it 's a little over 800 square meters is the amount that that you can use to build a you know a substantial house of this size is limited because of the location of the soil line in the front um right-hand corner and there 's also a couple of it 's an unusual block because it slaps from north to south across this way and also from east to west back down so obviously they want to push the 's no objections from any notifications as yet and it 's a new area and it 's a house in keeping with the area and i think there 's no reason why it shouldn 't be improved thank you councilman for the same reasons as councilman i support submissions closed on the 11th december 2020 i 'm wondering if i can ask the acting planning director whether there were any objections um by that date noting that days passed through the through the mayor and the general manager during that period thank you that was my question yeah the comments counsellors put the recommendation all in favor harry thank you page 33 counselors item 1304 development application 10 2020.84.1 shed the recommendation is that council vary part c55 building height plane of its current dcp 2001 associated to development application 10.2020.84.1 the construction of a shed at lot 8 in dp 249 130 being known as one tarana crest one tarana road oberon and that a division is called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. do you have a mover council mccarthy councillor people thank it 's pretty straightforward man of me it 's just a small variation thank you councilman council capable uh yes um that is a small variation that 's a um an interesting uh one to read about it 's an odd looking block but um it doesn 't look like a uh a big deal what they want to do and here any other comments from this one counseling they want to maximise their investment and place the shed in the section that 's going to give them a little more green space and uh i think it 's a wider variation so again it should be approved thank you any other comments on this one i 'll put the recommendation all in favor howard university thank you and page 38 counselors item 1305 development application 1305 oh no development sorry development application 10.2020.63.1 new dwelling recommendation is the council vary causes c55 building height plane and c63 density control on lot a in dp9722 to allow a reduced setback of one meter on the western boundary and floor space ration of 0.405 1. the council approved development application 10 mdp 972259 being known as 85 over on street oberon in accordance with section 4 16 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 and conditions contained within this report for the following reasons the development is permissible with consent in the b2 local centre zone of the oberon local environmental plan 2013. the development meets the objectives of the oberon local environmental plan 2013 and the oberon development control plan 2001 that a variation to call clause c555 and c63 of the oberon development control plan 2001 is considered acceptable in this instance as neighbouring properties will be unreasonably will be unreasonably impacted that overall the development will not detract from the locality and conversion of to a commercial use in the future if possible if desired three a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. do i have a movement please counsel kellum and the second to place councilman how 's the kill on i think about there it 's interesting to see a residential development there um though it 's also pleasing to see a new building appearing in town not be unreasonably impacted it 's also on page 46 third bullet point under item 23. same wording and i was going to have to raise that in a minute because i couldn 't accept it with the words will be unreasonable both of them are referred to page 46 page 46 under item 21 conclusion and recommendations i think it 's the point a variation to clause c55 and c63 of the oberon development control plan 2001 is considered acceptable in this instance and then it says as neighbouring properties will be unreasonably i can confirm councils that that is the case so i support this record with the amendment thank you councilman oh yes i 'm fully supported the recommendation it 's good to see um some of those uh vacant blocks in the lower end of the main street being taken up and anything that improves to look along the streetscape there 's [Music] zone i would automatically assumed it was commercial but when i read b2 local center zone information what 's the difference between local center zone and commercial through the chair minor b2 allows commercial and residential associated users but that doesn 't preclude your city centre from also allowing it 's just generally up rather than out we have commercial on the bottom floor and residents above it so um there is a great deal of differences i 'm sure there 's some prohibitions that i don 't i can 't put my finger on at this point in time but that 's generally the the analysis is that it still allows for a mixed use the um the shed up the other end of carrington was redone that 's is that commercial down the bottom and residential at the top at the top of the carrington up here nice straight residential thank you thank you the comments on this one is i noticed all the conditions that are based on this but um is there any suggestion that the front windows need to be uh double raised in respect that this house is in between the royal hotel on the aerosol and that 's traversed and we 've received complaints in the parts it says on change 42 that double basements are mitigated to a suitable level 6.6 on page 42. okay thank you thank you any other comments on this one counselor i 'll put the recommendation all in favor thank you age 58 councillors item 1306 development application 102020.65.1 new dwelling the recommendation is that council vary the minimum allotment size of the ru1 primary production zone by three percent at lot 100 in dp1260070 to allow a dwelling to be permissible on 97 hectares consistent with clause 4.6 of the oberon local environmental plan 2013. the council approved development application 102020.65.1 for a new dwelling at lot 100 in dp126070 being known as 170 archstone rose isabella in accordance with section 4.16 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 and conditions contained within this report for the following reasons the development is consistent with the overall local environmental plan 2013. if a variation to the minimum allotment size within the 10 threshold prescribed by clause 4.6 has been approved by council that the development is consistent with all relevant controls of the oberon development control plan 2001 but overall the impact of the new dwelling is negligible on be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. do i have a mover please councilman mckibben thank you and councillor calvin councilman kevin thank you madam mayor um look this is we 're talking about a difference of only three hectares and obviously this has been approved previously for a previous dwelling and basically the same conditions apply it 's actually quite good to see that the village of um area around archstone is uh is growing um you might have to put new signs up soon the only thing i would comment is i think the recommendation should be listed as one two and three rather than four five and six i will tell you councillors that um the printing how do we hip up this month 's um system you might find little anomalies throughout the much the so having read through all of this and knowing what we 've what has been proved previously i i would move the recommendation uh the three parts of the recommendation i 'll call them one two and three if i may um for approval by of them thank you now the comments counsellors knew this was coming when we approved the subdivision item 1307 water usage drought assistance there 's a recommendation that council finalized the drought drought subsidy program affected immediately the council removed the ability to source water from the black springs and o 'connell water bores and provide direction to the community to access water from the oberon north street facility the council provide a time period of six months for all cards to be returned to council with a full bond return that upon proof of purchase bracket receipt council refund all unconsumed water at the rate it was purchased that any card not surrendered within the specified time frame no bond will be provided can i have a mover please councillor cable and council mckibben sorry madam madam i was going to propose that each of these recommendations be considered separately and we first need to move the recommendation sorry and we can do it well i can 't second it if i 'm moving are you happy to still move that recommendation yeah that 's my if we want um separately if you get a mover in a second or for all five you do one motion unless you get a motion to deal separately with the secondary council mccarthy all in favor harry thank you okay so the recommendation is that council finalize the drought subsidy program effective immediately thank you councilman um look i think the situ the situation has um dramatically changed in the overall area basically um we may have to review that if this if we go into drought type conditions and um farm dams again become dry but i think the current conditions it is appropriate that this be basically finalized at this moment yes with that that 's um it 's been a terrific um help to a lot of people but i think the time um has come to an end and as councilman kevin said if necessary we can review it again when the need be um but yeah can you comment on this one counselors number one how 's the kill um i support councillor caitlin and other speakers um it was a very successful program it was designed are on tank water because they were getting exorbitant charges to get water delivered and this this solved a fairly significant problem for them and also provided a great deal to the community and i know that we were the first council in the central west to move on such a program and others i agree with all speakers and i think the community has much appreciated this initiative any other comments if not i 'll put the recommendation one all in favor karen thank you two but council removed the ability to source water from the black springs and o 'connell water boards and provide direction to the community to access water from the overall north street facility i 'll move the place councillor people do i have a second council journey because the capital i think i met a mayor the way things have uh have gone this we just talked about i don 't think there 's any need for people to to access water from either of those places however i 'm sure that they 'll be uh uh the water both of those places will 's recovering from the music madam me um i support councillor apple 's logic i think generally uh drawing back on that emergency assistance and drawing from water from either at a cheap price or from the artesian resources should be further restricted now that we are in uh had a little bit more rain any other comments councilman kevin thank you madame i 'd just like to ask through you um if i could um the dam currently is 32.9 so if people are sourcing water and they come back to the north street facility they 're actually drawing on the dam which is i 'd still say at less than an optimum level my question is would it not be better if people are sourcing water to do it from black springs and o 'connell water boards rather than to deplete our dam i can completely understand if our dam was at 90 percent or 80 but we are at 31.8 percent um i know that probably and i don 't know that a lot of people aren 't sourcing water at the moment but it worries me to deplete our dam further i also understand there 's a cost of um obviously the administration for black springs and our common water boards of continuing keeping them open except for emergency purposes so through you madame air i just i 'd like to make on those aspects of the general manager would be able to comment um through through the mayor the reason for the proposed recommendation is simply for control purposes um the the cars that are currently out there do not have a this is only accessible via this particular system like they 're very unique uh they 're a they 're a combined system that allows people to use the cards as each of their systems in order to have a control over the system the north street system is the only one that 'll allow us to continue to do that which is why for the time being we 're proposing to shut those two systems off and yes they will be available for emergency purposes but that 's the reason behind the the recommendation as it sits in terms of is it draining is a total reticulated source of water from our allocation that we 're allowed and pay for from water new south wales the other two are not so it 's unregulated unrestricted i understand that but the dam 's still not optimal um i understand that in councillors it 's gone from 33.1 to 32.9 32.5 i 'm thinking about about that that was my concern it 's the it 's it 's a damn level purely the damn woman i know that the water being drawn is minimal though yes that 's what that and i that 's probably and this can always be revisited yes okay i 'm happy with that on that basis i am i think i 'm happy yeah is there any other counselor i was just going to make the observation uh this is often pointed out by a member of a community who follows our water this is called matt kane gardener and even including black springs and o 'connell what the town draws from our water supply is never the problem our usage from our water supply if if we were the we would not have problems so the the issue was not elsewhere council mccarthy did you watch this yeah for convenience sake shouldn 't we be keeping these two spots open like um we talk about the environment nor less that means that people are going to come all the way into over 21 kilometers from black springs or they 've got to come up from ocon surely goodness we can levy the card so that they pay a reasonable amount or a commercial rate and and the uh facility remain open remember it 's their money to pay for this thing not ours it 's a community that paid for this with a bit of green it 's their money so i i think we should keep it over yourself whether we change the price per litre on the card or whatever i don 't get it but i think for convenience sake they own it you own those things they expect they expected to be there to be there for them and that 's why they supported it i think you should be kept open to yourself through was a drought initiative that we originally put in place and our control over the two remote bores is limited the second thing is we do not have the ability to now put a new charge on those two boards because when people purchase water they purchased liters of water not put dollars on their cards to change it so that was the process that was set up at the time so that the purchase of leaders rather than changing the price is difficult in this instance that 's okay so when people purchase the water they purchase litres of water but you put them so if someone comes sorry they went through you i 'll just go to counselor people first thank you thank you very much um yeah that 's basically what i was going to say and now now is is the ideal time to do it when the season is good there 's plenty of water and not forgetting that it 's non-potable water that comes out of those bores and so suitable only for for stock water and i don 't think there would be area so now it 's the ideal time to do it to get control of those cards again and then we can review it uh in the future if if there is a demand starting to appear for uh for people needing stock water we can we can look at opening uh giving access to those two borsig thank you had you finished i 'm sorry councilman no i i disagree with that to to just say that it 's for palable water that and the other ones too weren 't so some people have been there trying to hold onto their fruit trees and they know that they 're gonna they 're supplementing with pelicons and things like that the money is minimal i mean like i i don 't see that as a big thing because what we spend down there on the card reader o 'connell sixteen thousand dollars were correct oh yeah so there was the money on there the difference between them getting them drought money or paying the commercial rate is minuscule all i see that the people using at the moment are trying turn and dry and they 're therefore going out and saving their trees and saving what we want them to do keep their trees alive by just going up there and getting a couple of pelicans of water a week and we 've taken that away from them they 've got to drag their trailers and that up to our abram when that facility they own it communions it should be kept available for them sorry my understanding is if i 've got a card and i come to council now and say i want to buy let 's say 20 000 liters of water i will be charged for the 2.97 not the previously subsidized rate three dollars three dollars yes three dollars sorry so that means i 'm paying the full price as i should be because of what we 've done with the resolution one i completely agree with it so through through resolution one you will now pay 5.80 right 5.80 so that 's the that 's the concession right but if i want to buy the water at that price and i have the card on the readers at both mcconnell and black springs and i go to black springs and i put the card through when i buying for 20 000 liters of 5.80 or whatever it is um i don 't unders i understand that the position in relation to people who 've already got liters on their cards but um we spent a lot on these readers so what we 're going to do is turn turn the system off and say right if you want water you 've got to come to oberon now but my question is if i 'm prepared to pay the 5.80 for 20 000 liters and get campbell one of his names at the campbell to do the karting um why shouldn 't what 's the problem with using the expensive readers at black springs to then get my 20 000 liters because is the real question is you want people to bring their cards back and change them so they 've got a new card if they want to purchase at the new price can 't_''_8678.16 we just um and this maybe goes further into 'm not understanding why if there 's a potential for people to buy in the future they return their card why would we would you just not say that if you 've got liters now on your card let 's say 3 000 liters because of the price differential you can now only get 500 liters for that that money i 'm just trying to understand because we have the readers we have the system i would have thought the system should have been set up to adapt for this sort of situation um because i would have expected members of the community to be able to hold onto that card and if the drought comes again then they say come to council and say here 's my card i want to buy 3 000 and the person 's reception says okay you know it 's 5.80 council hasn 't resolved yet to reduce the price i go out to black springs and fill my vehicle up with 20 000 liters having deposited whatever i do the amount of money for it accounts um a couple of answers to that a potable supply of water it 's a drinking water once you originally wanted to implement the two are non-potable and currently there was a charge on it at raw water rate so it 's a minimal charge so if someone bought that water at their minimal charge they buy twenty thousand liters of water at a minimal charge which cost them four dollars for lacking the better work the whole idea about removing this at this point in time is to say to people if they want to exploit that they exploit it from the north street supply rather than the remote supplies all right so you can still use your card because you 've purchased that water at that rate what we 're trying to do is minimize the the um the exploitation of those two balls at this point in time and you can 't_''_8809.52 do that through a pricing because the way the card readers were set up is that at the time you bought litres of water and put that on your card not put twenty dollars worth of water on your card and and is set up is that you go there and you put one thousand liters and it cuts out a thousand liters not 2.50 and it cuts out at 2.50 worth of water so this risk recommendation is a way of minimizing that in the in the initial instance and then as the report indicates council can then through a different assessment look at when you activate those systems again council resolve not to do that then that probably exposes you to a number of things thank you man through through you if if i could so i i i 'm i understand exactly what the general management mike my problem is that this what we 've been through is gonna be the first to last round i would have thought that we should have a system that is flexible enough and as we spent a considerable amount on the readers at both locations that is flexible enough to be able to adapt to what we have just talked about because when we have a drop next time we 're probably going to be offering subsidised water we 're going to in tonight so we should be able to issue cards from community whereby we can change the value of the water change what 's on the you know how are we going to do this in the future because i just don 't you know i just don 't see what we 're offering at the moment or what we 're proposing is going to be a final solution to this and i would suggest that maybe we need an item six that council investigate a system which can be more flexibly designed using the current readers that will adapt to the situation we 're actually discussing tonight with droughts and then moving out of drought so that people can use that the cards can be adapted flexibly to cope with this i really don 't want to have to have to put in your readers considering the expense we 've the real question is though is it possible to adapt these quite expensive card readers to load dollars not liters if that is the case if that is possible the solution to this is that we go we um lose a few bucks so be it we then have a reduced time period to return your cards get new cards which are dollar denominated and you can get a refund for the water you purchased whatever in fact basically the same uh item three but that is predicated on the ability to load dollars and not leaders and until we know whether that is possible we 're not really in a good position to make a decision through the chair the recommendations were set up on the basis that this initiative was put in to support people 's drinking water in drought scenarios and the o 'connell and black springs bores are not potable supplies so that 's the other other issue and that 's that 's true but they are non-total supplies and within reason they should be they should be denominated at a different price correct um and let 's let 's if we accept that that 's an issue let 's give ourselves a couple of months and let people use it at whatever price they 're getting but we need to understand can we re dollar denominations so that when we change the price it doesn 't get silly as it is at the moment so can i ask is that possible at the moment i think it 's software related in terms of leaders and leaders dispensed certainly in the correlation of what these boards are capable of in the software component not unlike uh i suppose firefighter these days in terms of coke machines for example and taking your phone there and purchase your can of coke i don 't think the technology exists at the minute and then again again the other issue taking into consideration not all these water balls all the time are in serviceable areas or areas of mobile service so it is something that we can take on board look at what possibilities there are in upgrading these readers card readers in terms of correlating it back to relevance in terms of dollar purchase versus liters um but at this stage i 'm not quite sure that these particular machines in terms of the software are capable of going to a dollar okay so but until what i balls and i 'm not convinced it 's a good idea um and how we avoid that is we just accept we 're going to take a loss and make sure we 've got a system in six months time or three months time we 've taken all the cards back that we can actually denominate in dollars until we know that we 're just going to staff around frankly or implement the the recommendation that 's being put in front of you this is something that we 're going to look at next time that there 's a serious drought we we instituted this process because we had a very very serious drought of the nature that we 've never had before so you know this this might not come up again let 's let 's cross that bridge when we come to it but in the short term perhaps we might be able to do something a little bit more drastic and that is so you can give notice that say the end of january we cancel all cards all cards come back in those who 've got new card they they they get another card at the going rate just call call all the cards back in um for a credit cancel all cards simple isn 't that what we 're actually isn 't that what we 're actually saying here yeah three four and five but over a longer time frame than you 're suggesting yeah let 's let 's do it more quickly uh and keep keep your colon black spring spores going well we had four customers last month um so it doesn 't matter much whether they 're they keep going or not and and i something else that concerns me is this non-political water and there 's non-political water going out of those bores that 's going into water tanks does that give any um does council have any responsibility about people taking non-potable water out there and using it for things they shouldn 't it 's all right if they put it on trees or feed it to cows going through the chair this site is there to um you know advise on that health regulation so we can 't police madam mayor um if we can 't change the software in the readers we can have a validity data renewable my understanding is it 's like a magnetic floating when it comes into the counter yeah and like a credit card you you can you can put a validity period on through the gym my understanding is that the cards that are out there we can 't_''_9358.56 do that no but you could with new issue cut correct so if we get all the cards in and we have to reissue cards and that 's why i was making a recommendation six weeks because i think we need to devise this system even if we do what each of the resolute two three four and five ask is we need to devise a system that is more flexible for when we hit this situation again so that we can have cards that have a validity date or we have cards that are dollar denominated if that 's not which i think is the preferential one but if we can 't do that then we have a system which has a be renewed every three or six months or something and at least in that case we have control over much more control over the situation or some other way to to get where we are because i see that what the ultimate position would be that someone has a card that they can use during proud times they 've paid a bond for it um most of the year it 'll be those times to be sitting there but when they have to drop they don 't have to go through the whole and or somehow they can be remotely activated or something we need to to work a system that benefits the requirements i think is not the money the cards or anything i agree with mark callum this time but it 's designed this is a facility for the people that 's right and that 's what was given the money from the drought assist uh not the drought the million dollars thing to create a facility and that 's what it 's there and we 're going to take it away for dollars leave the facility open got to take a fall or you go and rearrange the cards the facility 's there it 's there for the people propose to the people leave it there for another bit of a different limb here but we have major road works going on out there very shortly and why couldn 't this be used to fill our tank because we 've had to run back to town to get water to water the roads i 'm not sure whether the forestry is going to let us into their paddocks or not with fire danger and why couldn 't we be using that to fill up our water charts right through the cheese is there a reason you can at least currently it 's currently happening okay i 'm going to what we are discussing here is item two the council will remove the ability to source water from black springs and our corner waterfalls and provide direction to the community access water from the overall north street facility i 'm going to put that recommendation all in favor against that motion is defeated we now go to number for all cars to be returned to council with a full bond return do i have a mover no mood counselor kellum do i have a second one have no second one i 'll second that motion let 's have a discussion counselor callum i think the question here is not whether it 's six months but whether what we need to do is return all the cards refund the bond any liters or any cash value that is on that card and what we do next and what we do next is is have a system which is flexible is dollar denominated rather than liters denominated and can allow for changes in what council may determine in a future drought we should be charging for potable water and what we should be charging for non-potential water from black springs so i have i think in fact items three should be a little bit further down the list and we need to have direct the general manager to initiate an investigation in how to provide a card system for water from north street o 'connell and black springs so initiated for dollar denominations for water to be drawn from potable water from north street and non-potable water from black springs and a column are you proposing an amendment any part of the emotion that we 're looking at we 're not changing the actual motion but i 'm happy for somebody else to close this amendment look i would propose the council provide a time period three months for all cards we 've turned to council back up with a full bond return and with the general manager be directed to investigate an update or sorry an upgrade of the current system to allow for pricing of water to be modified on cards for north street blacks brings an o 'connell and that provides flexibility for future death drought periods that is my proposed amendment i 'd seek a second oh thank you and can i just get an understanding of what andrew is trying to do yeah can we just say he 's only saying that only happens in drought periods what about when it 's just dry and not declared um i 'm happy for that change for facilities does that help yep very good thank you thank you i 'm happy with that are you happy with that how 's the table do you wish to speak to them no thank you does anybody else wish to sleep to this how 's the dream yes ma 'am just to make the observation that this was an innovative drought program [Music] and that i 'm not sure that it makes good sense to make that drought program a regular feature the the over the whole scheme of the motions you know the situation has not i mean the the dams are full the grass is growing but the dam 's low it 's raining in queensland but it 's not raining here i just feel that this is not as responsible as we should be with this one that 's what i want to say is there anyone else speaking to this either for or against it are you happy with your clarification i 'm more than happy thank you okay i 'm going to put the amendment that council provide a time period of three months for bond return and that the general manager be requested to investigate an upgrade to the current system to allow for pricing of water to be modified on north street black springs and o 'connell that provides flexibility for future use of those facilities i 'm putting that recommendation councillors all in favour against capstone is against the amendment 's carried and becomes the motion all in favor of the motion against council donors against the motion number four upon proof of purchase receipt council refund all unconsumed water at the rate it was purchased a mover place oh sorry madam um i might have to declare an interest because i 've actually got money on my card do you want me to i cannot lose something should i just wait out of there i think it would be safer yes all right you 'll have a second dollar that 's why i split the motion as well so i have an interest in them don 't get too far away because the interest rate [Music] period of three months for all cards to be returned through the chair the two bring your card back and get your bond back which we put on each of the cards the second one relates to whether you wanted to um include the allocation of water that still remains on the card as part of your motion or weather as part of the room you wanted to just give them the bond back and not any of the allocation that 's still on the card so you 're getting the bond and the allocation i would say in light of recommendation three you would now look at implementing recommendation for yeah again you 're giving the bond the refund and the water thank you madam mayor it just seems fair and reasonable that if somebody 's got a credit on their card that we refunded know what to say any other comment on this one councils i 'll put the recommendation over the dance come back into the room we have noted um your conflict counselor but it should have been done at the beginning of the nation i realized that sorry madame number five any card not surrendered within the specified time frame our counselor cable counselor callum councillor cable i don 't think there 's anything you need to debate that complimentary thank you uh only comment i 'll make that in there is i think we have actually arrived at the sensible water policy through this process thank you any other comments counsellors put the recommendation all on favour harry thank you 77 item 1308 dual naming of fisher macquarie rivers to include colombo the recommendation is that council indicate to bathurst regional council that this process should be undertaken through appropriate community consultation by the geographic names board prior to providing an opinion being formulated for the dual naming of the fish river wanbul that council indicated bathurst regional council that given the macquarie river does not transverse over on council local government area that no opinion is provided do i have a mover council givens yeah i 'll make another recommendation for all the reasons that 's listed there below thank you councilman thank you madam mayor yes i i agree with the recommendation um and while i have no problem with um dual names uh for things i is something that 's going to be pushed by the community and that includes our community if we 're going to be supporting any other comments on this one councilman councilman i 'm just wondering if we should be um asking or putting a recommendation to bathurst regional council that as bathurst was named after lord bathurst who was a main stalwart of the british colonial policy that maybe they should consider naming their city bathurst we 're jury there 's a recommendation any other comments on this one yes i always try to find out if young is on a river so we could suggest they change the macquarie to the same name as the river that runs through young since batter 's suggestion was that they would be forever young i 'm putting this recommendation into parts councillors all in favour harry thank you page 80 councillors item 1309 raw fire service jenola brigade station rebuild the recommendation is that council will nominate the open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 166 a of the local government regulation 2005 the provision of a new rural fire building footprint in general and caves trust reserve that at the conclusion of the tender period a detailed report be brought back to council meeting of february 2021 with the adoption of a suitably qualified company to complete the construction of a new rural fire shed for the genoalan brigade council mccarthy moving a second to please counselor kellen thank you councillor mccarthy and that speaks for itself and it 's good that we 've got a resolution thank you for the recommendations any other comments on this one counsellors i 'm putting the recommendation all in favor karen thank you reports for information counsellors 83 item 1401 monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that report item 1401 is received as information can i have a mover plus councillor dhoni and councilman clinton thank you yes um just to uh draw people 's attention to the um the you know orange which has done an extremely good job of marketing itself in many many ways and creating a great deal of uh natural beauty around this town has has gone for just a simple straight stone wall with but just thinking about the style of it we got fairly close with this yeah they got fairly close to us on 87. it 's very simple but well you know there 's another one but orange you can see unlike terralgo but you know we 're on track thank you councilman kevin um thank you man i know i don 't have even further i think um the signage situation is being rolled out very well and it 's being appreciated by the villagers um it looks very smart thank you any other comments um just on page 84 we 're down to 78 employees what we have about 83 before um through the chair it 's average employees that changes actual each month i i realize that but i 'm just wondering are we losing outdoor staff and that 's why i know that the grass has grown phenomenally at the moment this year we seem to be a little bit behind outs doors that was all um through the chair there 's a number of reasons for that including a pretty intense construction program name a few grasses that are in our reserves uh the ability to source contractors in this sorry the ability to source casuals in this time where current covert mechanisms are in place has been difficult um but we 're looking to rectify those through through additional casuals where we can get older do we need another mowing tractor as we didn 't take full um result of the bushfire money that we get on the state roads last year did we we didn 't take advantage of all the money did we we never done the o 'connell road left over given the drought conditions and the lack of need for cutting vegetation which we couldn 't sort of make those claims so you know that 's an unfortunate circumstance that we 're in with drought related conditions but again we 're in an opposite position this year so um yeah certainly we look at machinery and um ability to hire in which we require that so okay i 've never seen you hide in slashers or mail at that time no but if we need to then certainly we have that point is that what you 'll also know is that this is around the time we would traditionally have pool staff and pool staff now fall under a managed contract through the wire so they don 't become part of our full-time equivalents what i 'm talking about is road vegetation the comment from the lady out of paul 's retreat about the way the cemetery was loss of income that we could generate for the rural fire service so are we looking at maybe looking at another mower tractor for this part of the season that we take advantage and recruit the money that 's that 's all right thank you thank you madame i just briefly like to um that 's all to have a look at the economic development activities but particularly the promotional stuff there are some phenomenal results there um i think i think our team at the rick and the economic development people are doing a fantastic job um and we the we want you back campaign um was greatly successful and the figures there you know 360 increase in uses of the website every saturday the place is running red hot and that just doesn 't happen by accident it 's happened because it 's been a fair bit of hard work and and good work put into doing it and every one of those people that comes into town um even if they only buy a cup of coffee that 's another cup of coffee that has been sold in the town and i think a lot of them are spending a lot more than a cup of coffee thank you councilman any other comments uh just on page 89 there 's a couple of meetings at any comments of the 11th of november with jason mulcaney in the forestry corporation is that how you say that through the chair i had a meeting with jason maltington together with the mayor where we discuss many things including um some of the issues that council raised and asked me to forward on behalf of um of council we discuss them and uh looking to have um a reply to that correspondence sometime soon and the 30th and november on the same page central the mayor jason mulkington was also involved in that meeting together with myself the mayor and the new south wales forestry hub group that previously has been indicated that the mayor and i sit as part of this was a meeting that related to the general um uh sorry the agm for that for that group as well as a general meeting to move and progress some of the recommendations that have been made to spend the money that has been provided by the government to look at forestry activity in these hubs there 's a new general merger isn 't there that good and united timber barrage has been added um through through the chair we have a a managing director i would suspect that 's been engaged to basically um put all these projects together the commentary that he made was that in our current hub there could be or should be a consideration for further patronage of that i must note that the mayor and i have been on this committee now for over 12 months and 12 months ago we made exactly the same commentary however industry are now looking at outside the box thinking very good thank you mr counselor any other comments counselors just the recommendation all in favour thank you page 90 counselors item 1402 monthly activa report activity report planning and development the recommendation is that report is received as information council mcgivern thank you a second to please councillor cable thank you councilman kevin do you wish to speak to the republican i think madame a detailed report i would just if i quit a couple of questions um in relation to the second paragraph under planned activity for november the the unauthorized sorry the actually it 's the first paragraph the investigation of a pollutant pollution incident um was that a sudden pollution incident or was it an incident that may relate to the issues we 've been having with the stp through the chair or the southern into the southern election right the second question is um we the fourth paragraph is about the roaming dogs issue we seem to have this obviously on the under the um activity report planning and development for some time is there any issue of these roaming dogs and is it the same roaming dogs are we now talking about different roaming dogs isn 't the ones that near porters would fret down that way so through the chair the issue we have is that we don 't know whether it 's the same roaming dogs or different roaming dogs because of the same breed but no registration of those dogs the fact that they 're in the rural zone makes it a little bit more difficult based on some information that i 've received i 'm looking at engaging with a potential group that may want to do a program out that way that could um look at wild dogs in that in that locality well the wild dog group at berger i know is um he 's quite concerned through the chair maybe that 's the group that i 've seen you talking to um the next issue if i could matter mayor is the independent living units has an occupation certificate been issued for those yet um through the chair no it hasn 't um so when are we likely of schedule for those is it when an occupation certificate is issued because i know that a preliminary final inspection has occurred so it 's through the chair what council is trying to do is get this development to a point where a final occupation could be issued very quickly the key component here is that the gas that 's a problem that 's yet to be connected to the site that we have no control over hasn 't been provided we 've had a number of attempts it 's what on my understanding the latest one being that it was going to be put on last thursday however the mains that they thought were in the street weren 't in the street and they would need to look at that it was supposed to be connected on friday and wasn 't and we 're looking at our processes now to escalate that to get it move forward as quickly as you possibly can so does that mean is that going to be are we going to be hit for a variation because the main wasn 't in the street going to mean is there going to be a claim for an extension of time and a claim for a variation in cost my understanding through the chair is that that would be the gas authority 's responsibility but that has delayed our completion and the contractor may put the cost on to us and then we have to put it back to the gas authority through the chair we are the contractor and council are working together to have this matter resolved as quick as we can at this point in time the only thing that doesn 't work is the hot water in the in the units and we can 't have people in there without hot water okay you said there are a number of minor issues have they all been corrected other than the gas through the chair the minor issues would be dealt with as part of the final occupation and it 's my understanding that those matters have been met council will only go back there again now when we get the go ahead from the gas authority to say that the gas is you i move the recommendation to the are reportedly accepted thank you council isn 't the gas in roster and maybe that we 've got to dig the trench to get it onto the site is what happens lots of times in the past but if you 're a developer private developer and you had a block of six slabs wouldn 't you be looking for compensation for the hundred dollars a week you 're gonna miss out so who do we go that for um through the chat yeah we 'll say that on those okay i 'd have to take that on those the builder or you know you guessed that they 'll just say you never applied early enough aren 't they but anyway what i didn 't notice though when i was down there yesterday is when it 's not your own you you look around at different things i think we 've got a steel a concrete post there which is part of the fence and when it was windy esty the post just blown they are it it 's a fence it should have it 's our fault it 's our design and and with the problems we 've had we must look at the time of the person that give us the design of the units the time taken i understand that another person they 've done the job for all the listing of the services was on the builder 's document that went out where the gas was available in the street where the power was available where the water was available same person yet we seem to have copped the lemon i don 't know and what did it take us six months to get the plans drawn up on it because a long time the excuse was that the legs were broken but you 'd nearly think you when your legs are broken you 'd be sitting in front of a computer but you know and and that person done another job and done it pretty expedient for another person indeed but anyway i i just think the whole thing 's been handled badly and i also note the council haven 't put the cardboards up yet like the cemented excuse me through the chair i 've noted an issue if they are constructed which is why i 've indicated that it should stop and we should need to have another look at that the counterpoints in regard to the to the existing units i take that on board i spoke to you yesterday but where you 're going to put them have a real good thing go down to the site and have a look where you 're going to put my car parks the only place you can put them is on the cemented area where you 're already cemented for it there 's no other option when you take the use of the shed apparently we 've got to have two people use the shed so you can you 're restricted any other comments on this one councilman thank you putting recommendation all in favor thank you page 95 councillors excuse me item 1403 monthly activity activity report technical services recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have someone to move that please councillor gibbons thank you in a second though thanks today to sort out some questions thank you thank you thank you madam mayor look a detailed report um and i would like to pass on uh through you as the technical services director the appreciation of the burger community of the work done on judd 's creek with the new culverts and fixing up the um the table drain that have become excessively deep as a result of gouging from storms the cement put into it and the additional coal work um it certainly looks to be an excellent excellent job and the burraga community last thursday night commentary specifically um just wondering and i realized some council resources are very tied up at the moment when when the work on the other side of the bull hill will commence um where the land slip has occurred uh yeah through the chair certainly got that program to happen uh that will be the assistance of some contractor engagement to do that we were hoping to be there this side of christmas but um it 's not looking very certain at this stage so um high priority is where it that the work on archstone road with the um the culverts etc had been achieved and um was looking good at this stage great yeah so yeah good work was done there i i know it 's not within in our council area but um is there any and i haven 't been down the last week or so but the work on the jenoland caves road um between um turned off with duckworth road and hampton is there any idea when that 's been completed or has it been completed the stock go there through the chair i think it 's on the going at this stage so we have no estimate date um because that 's causing quite a bit of inconvenience five months i read five months yeah i don 't think it 's uh anticipated until early march april next year in terms of completion thank you so much and as progress gets reported back to transport i 'll endeavor to keep council updated yeah okay it might be an idea to to do that through good news week every month or something don 't have any updates that would be good because obviously it 's our major um transport route to uh to sydney and blue mountains thanks our tourist council um good report this month like a couple of highlights i think the recreation ground fenced over coal is so fabulous to stay up there and it 'll be even better when it when it weathers in a bit it 's a bit bit brash at the moment but that 'll soften as time goes by and i 'm very pleased to see how much work we 've done on uh spray ceiling getting up to three kilometres is a a really good outcome support counsellor callum 's observation people are um pleased as punching um i too will gladly weather us down a bit very thankful we never installed the gate that came with that excuse me one of the most garish things i 've ever seen in my life so people are quite excited about it the footpath has been uh issues been resolved uh and uh folk um uh also very happy with that i think um there 's a few up in the future we can modify but it 's actually quite a good design to you know that granite and cement mix if you get it right it 's they get it right it 's really firm that 's unobtrusive it 's less sort of stand outish um and that you know they 're feeling rather spoiled down there at the moment and then they took a drive down the carl wood road we 're very excited about as someone said last night the road just kept going so that was that was pretty good so yeah they 're really um uh enjoying and uh and thankful of those uh improvements in their community down there at the moment so thanks very much to all concerns thank you councillors mccarthy yeah um just a good result out there at ginken road um mrs alves pulled me up yesterday and seen a great result especially with the uh line marking on the corners she feels a lot safer um she said there 's no excuse for her safety now so she thanks council very much thank you thank you with extended obviously up beaconsville road um i 'm just wondering if councillor dhoni is thinking of creating a sort of um horses and hounds group to go hunting with something in the area because obviously post fencing is very appropriate for that we shall be advertising for foxes shortly put the recommendation on them thank you we 've got it there we just can 't have councillors councillors monthly active direct corporate services the recommendation is the report item is received as information can i have someone to leave that please counsel mcgivern and a second account to go on welcome thank you madame um a very informative uh report um i was just wondering through you madame the director could um give us an update on the information technology issue and the ems working party which seems to be a bit split on the recommendations and where we 're going to go with this and i hope we 're not going to have an undue delay because of obviously there are um there 's some division within the group as to which way we should go back to the been working away looking at three different systems the division is purely on the basis of an understanding of what the program 's individual programs can do for all areas of council some are more developed in some areas than others hence why early next year in early february the working party will do a small road trip to uh have a look at councils who are actually using these systems so madame when do we expect a decision so we 're looking at june three through you madame are the rookie party expect to provide a final recommendation to emt in march and if it 's not a unanimous where do we go from there um through you guys that 's something that the emt will need to consider and make a decision on thank you madame move the recommendation the report be accepted by council thank you any other comments on this one controller council did you want to support the recommendations i 'm done oh the general managers just asked me to mention a note australia day um you do have it is a ticketed event but 's a free ticketed event just under covered restrictions we have to know numbers so you just pick up a ticket it 's not it 's absolutely free we 'll be highlighting that into the community over the next couple of weeks in case there 's any misunderstanding no serious question there 's no there 's no limit what 's the current restrictions on the limits changing all the time but we don 't think we 're going to have a problem i 'm going to put the recommendation counselors all in favor harry thank you page 106 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is there that the council received the reporter 's information and overplays council capable thank you and councillor kellum thank you councillor caitlyn mayor i 'll believe that the council receives the report as information thank you nothing to add any other comments i 'll put the recommendation all in favor okay thank you page 109 1406 grant 's monthly update the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have a mover please counselor mckibben thank you in a second a very a couple of matters of clarification if i could under successful grant applications and funding notification no i think it 's actually page 112. uh project implementation um under 3a community program round two where it talks about the berger hall upgrade um it was indicated the other night the new equipment for the kitchen upgrade has not been purchased and the only work that 's being done today because of the extension of this grant is the floor sanding which is currently being undertaken and the electrical upgrade the remainder of the work will not be undertaken and on the new equipment purchased until 2021 calendar year in relation to page 113 um i know from um the bushfire local economic recovery fund the two projects that we 're putting forward actually council will not have an opportunity to see those i 'm assuming before they are submitted by the 28th of january the costings or the grant amounts so that will go in without us looking at it and the same with the um under five the your high street pedestrian link which i think we 're designating to the proposed new community hub so that both those will be submitted uh prior to us looking at was that correct that through the chair that 's correct however it has been provided to the council that we 'll be looking at chasing funding opportunities for all these projects um the your high strength funding given that council has now endorsed an area gives up give council a little bit more scope to be able to look at that funding mechanism a lot more seriously than what it would have if you chose another location so through with the one million if we apply for up to one million does that would that include any other enhancements to the main street that um we could include within that amount um my understanding is that it could support beautification projects if that 's where the council is looking to head um however there has to be a uh an emphasis on creating thoroughfares and linking and linking areas so you have to be looked at reasonably paving wouldn 't come into it absolutely um do we have any budgetary amount here to the new hub would cost through through the chair at this point in time know that something will now go back to the architects and ask for a design or certainly some concepts around flow and how it would in fact link and meet the requirements that we need to service this grant funding opportunity so i assume that we if there 's if it comes in at less than a million which we hope it would we have some other projects that might fill the remainder of the minion does it have to be a single project or does it have to be a through can it be a composite through the chair council would be looking at trying to gain as much yeah exactly i 'm not i 'm not um currently over the the requirements of the guidelines so that i could take a little bit on notice and provide some updates to councillors on this this is where the initial thoughts of officers were so for instance uh with the placement of our power lines underground because it 's an enhancement of our high the high street and its functionality be an area that could be considered for inclusion potentially i would think that looking at how to create further green space in your city center would also be an opportunity that we could the power line 's going to be expensive to put it underground i 'm just asking the question if we can get a design costing because we 've already engaged the designer brick get them to bring that forward if there 's sufficient funds within that that 's a big cost item that would be nice to be able to fund here i don 't know what other councils support the viewers through the chair reading the document as i would i 'd be looking down how that would potentially contribute to local character potentially more than other things but once again i can take it on notice and look at that all right what was the other thing um i think that 's um that 's it thank you madame i would move that this report be accepted thank you casper councillor callum um one more comment that 's we had a total of over 34 million worth of grants going madam man this report i think was perhaps jumping the gun a little bit saying that the black springs association has advised that they will contribute to the project because when this report was written that they hadn 't however i can advise that last night they did agree to contribute uh up to fifteen thousand dollars to the project for the black springs all at the toilets at the black springs hall that 's what i was going to just speak on and yes are we supporting them financially to get the job underway we had chris milne out there to present a good presentation so that 's a good result thank you any other comments on this one with the recommendation all in favor thank you page 115 item 1407 water and sewer plant report the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a movement please tell us the pelham in a second councillor kellum i think it matter um always good to get the water into a report i going to be something that we need to be keeping a very close eye on unless uh rain front that 's up in the north coast now comes down this way another comment from this one councilman put the recommendation all in favor thank you paige 117 item 1408 monthly update status status of council resolutions recommendation is that report item is received as information can i have someone to move that way please councillor cable and councilman thank you cable to move that the report be received his information thank you councillor councilman thank you madam mayor yes extensive report um if i could mata mayor if i could go to page 121 so on the oberon sports complex which is the top item on that page that carries over from page 120 i thought at the last meeting we were told that borg was going to have was going in the process of finalizing these reports within the next two weeks they would be going lloyd for the jrpp now looks as though borg is looking to do this or it made it prior to christmas um are it 's that what four weeks we are absolutely certain that paul we 're going to do it but this is through the chair i can confirm through meetings i 've had today that they 're the da documents are very close and we 'll be lodging next week okay thank you so it 's yes um the next item is page 123 and it 's going over from 122 and 121. um so we 've had i understand that the building work has been handed over to prominent prominent floors for the fit out but they 've advised to delay until at least late january um do we have is there a contractual obligation or was there in the contract with prominent fluids a contracted period of time in which they had to complete this and if so did we levy are we going to levy any liquidated damages or damages for the delay because it 's obviously not due to force major it 's through their own planning etc but i note that with the new project management and contract management um procedures and policies we 've put uh through the chair certainly nothing in the agreement to enforce madura or anything on them at this stage again i think it is an unfortunate circumstances that have had obviously a four to six week delay um the equipment that i have been assured and i have evidence to prove that it is ready to go unfortunately the installation is not probably really the timely component it 's more so the actual integration into the plant and the approval process through state government which then is another another process on the back end of this so again at this stage we 're in a position where vinery is not that far away i you know think it is disappointing but is it it is a position that we 're at at this stage so did we delay in getting the project to where it is in november or prominent fluids provided in well advanced with a timeline that said you will be required to install late november uh through this year yesterday certainly through a uh certainly a uh induction meeting with both prominent and fps instructions has been whole process the disappointing you know unfortunately the prominent has experienced a delay on another project um further north of new south wales which has resulted in their technicians not been able to come to site to do the actual install but again the equipment is ready to go has been manufactured purposely for this particular plant and again the timeline is as as outlined in the previous report in the water report set for january to occur did we tell them that the anticipated date for installation was november 2020 um again for the chair certainly that was the uh that was the agreement that we had with prominent in terms of engaging them in anticipation of that timeline being met like all projects i mean not everything always goes to plan uh you know i do understand your force from a dura process but i think i do think that we should be sending a letter to problem fluid saying we know that you have indicated to us a delay again that has been for late january but should the delay extend beyond late january when we 're again through the chair i think the general manager can confirm i have kept him abreast of the situation and that particularly has been done so that letter has been sent in those words information has been said yes okay can we have the council given to them um just on the status of council again um in the last meeting which was the 17th of november there was an item 26 160419 which was um came from the 16th of april 2019 meeting which was the road closures portions of edith road at the last meeting on the 17th of november it was noted at the end that this matter was closed subsequent to the meeting i have had discussions with both mr and mrs webb and i have subsequently sent a lengthy email to the general manager [Music] um in that in their view this matter is certainly not quite closed and i have requested the general manager to carry out a full investigation into this matter which has cost mrs webb a considerable amount of money i therefore ask that this matter be put back in this the the matter closed was on the basis of information that was received to this technical services director on behalf of of how this has progressed as i 've indicated to councillor kibben i 'm more than happy to provide an update and i 'll be doing that and i 'll send the response to all councils in regard to that investigation but i don 't think the matter should be closed at this stage it should be put back on the status um through the chair the actions of the recommendations from council i believe have been met in the in the resolution the fact that individuals don 't think that matters have been closed because of certain things are at their discretion but i certainly would like to the opportunity to provide councils with that update as to why that is because there is more to it than just what 's been provided to i understand that that the principal involved who exchanged contracts and paid legal fees etc believe and it was indicated the last comment was this matter was resolved at a site meeting does not involved with this issue therefore i do not believe it could be closed well i think the fact that the general manager has said it 's closed and has offered to do a report an investigation report and circulate to councillors i think is quite adequate well i don 't think it can be closed matter now i disagree with that that 's fine council mccarthy i just wanted a clarification from chris whether this ties it up but just something to do with the rta meeting where the lady said that they won rms we 're going to retain the ground are you through the chair it was a original request to regain some unbearable road reserve adjacent to their property uh the matter in terms of transport new south wales is particularly a as the matter in a position where it is closed on the basis of acting um on that on our device and transport for yourself well so as the general managers pointed out certainly finished or furnishing the general manager with further information pertaining to the matter which will then be disclosed to councillors for until that further information is described and considered by council again the matter in discussion with the applicant at the time on the site visit with transport from new south wales i believe were satisfied and they were in agreement of that resolution and having full uh use of the land uh as a game which i 'll uh further outline in that information that i 've provided through the general manager for councillors and having extended a considerable amount of money any other comments counsellors on this report i 'm putting the recommendation all in that harry potter page 136 item 15 there is no urgent business this evening page 136 item 16 closed session confidential reports in accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government general regulation 2005 in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of the kind as referred to in section 10 bracket 10a bracket 2 of the act and should be dealt with in a part of the meeting close to the media and the public i 'd

    "text": "my name 's gary wallace and i am the general manager of overrun council i 'm with us this morning i have mayor kathy sagewitz um councillor anne daney and councillor kerry gibbons as well as staff chris schumacher damien ocean i see um kush kumar and the corporate services director lynette safranek with that in mind a lot fall on the mayor open the meeting with the acknowledgement of countries thank you barry nice technologist this meeting is being held on the traditional lands of the veradery gundam guara and direct people and respects the history and culture of the elders both past and present can i just take this opportunity to welcome you all to council 's presentation of the draft 2021-22 operational plan supported by the long-term financial assumptions as we go through this meeting and we will then take questions and we will take questions from the members of uh public press at the conclusion of the recording of the zoom meeting the meeting will then continue when questions will need to be submitted by the chat option on the screen we are looking at a i 'm sure and confident will be turned around as we move through the year and now we 'll pass over to the general manager gary wallace to talk about the plan thank you yeah thank you madam mayor i 'll call on my corporate services director let saffronic to run through the assumptions of the draft operational appointment uh good morning uh so basically this presentation outlines the 2021-22 operational plan the current is currently on public exhibition and some of the assumptions for that plan include forecast of total income of approximately 27.4 million which will be made up of a rate increase of two percent on land rates which is set by the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal also known as the rate pink an increase in the financial assistance grant or the block grant block supplementary allocation a significant increase in capital grants based on works that will be completed during this 2021-22 financial year also a reduction in investment revenue in accordance with the reserve bank of australia and council 's investment policy however this is due to be reviewed in the coming months we continuing operations however this will be reviewed and reconsidered after the exhibition period prior to adoption the employee salary wages and superannuation are forecast to increase by approximately 3.5 percent uh this includes the local government award and performance increases including the superannuation stepping up to ten percent this year fee uh training expenses have been calculated at two point five percent of total salary and wages costs which is a standard local for local government fees and charges have been calculated at 0.9 cpi unless statutory the cpi has just been adjusted for march and is at 1.1 percent and staff are reviewing if it if we take the fees and charges up to 1.1 what difference that will make to the operational plan prior to the june adoption um the draft this draft operational plan will be finalised for the june ordinary council meeting taking into consideration any movements identified such as additional grant funding being announced during the public exhibition period again council is proposing a substantial financial assistance allocation of section 356 to the community during 2021 of thousand dollars uh the planning and development director 's proposed under the current draft the council will continue to provide the overrun community with four free tip vouchers per assessment as well as one free tip day the bulky goods collection will continue to be undertaken in the overall township area and it is also it is also proposed under the current draft the council continued to operate black springs and bureaucrat cancer stations at their current level um drawdowns in 2122 are after the planning construction of a new landfill cell trained at the overall waste depot and work will continue during the 21 22 period at the current tip operations to better utilize the facility and this will be brought back to the community during 21-22 and over to uh technical services director thanks damian during 2122 regards to water and silver funds uh the superfund council plans to continue with the development of a design new series treatment plant in preparation for its construction this is anticipated to commence during 21 22. other undertakers in this area include modification and customization works involving councils sewer reticulation infrastructure upgrades and capital works and purchases in the renewal and operation performance upgrades to optimize the water treatment reticulation systems we 'll hand over to the corporate services director who will outline the long-term financial planning i 'm going to actually hand over to cush our new cfo to outline the long-term financial plan assumptions thanks everyone regarding the long-term financial planning for for operational plan it is only one year budget but we have to as per integrated planning and reporting framework we have to assume for the next 10 years which is our requirement which is to prepare the long-term financial planning for next 10-year assumptions it 's it 's not easy to assume what is happening in the next 10 years but still we have made our best estimations and uh the first item which is rates and annual revenue which is uh as per as per regulatory tribunal uh two percent is our um rate pack which we are assuming for next year and after that it 's going to be increased by a little bit amount and at the end it is going to be 2.5 percent uh for the for the next previously reduced uh the bag from two point eight percent to one point five percent but our assumption is going in the same way from two to two and a half percent because we are assuming that there is no immediate indication to reduce this amount by the by the regulatory uh regulatory tribunal other revenues uh we are assuming that it is uh as per the cpi most of our assumptions are based on the cpi index which we we have at this moment um other revenue which is going to be 0.9 and during during the next 10 years it is going to be reaching 1.7575 for grants and contribution uh provided for for for capital purposes uh these are the basically our backs grant which we are receiving from from from uh federal government uh roads to recovery grants and block grants uh this capital grants which we are assuming is uh four four of receiver siva point which is 900 000 this is the assumption that we are going to receive grants for for construction of our new uh silver treatment plan uh employee uh benefit assumption three percent increase in our salary and wages and super innovation then next item is our material and contracts material and contact is basically your expenditures for for contracts for our roads cleaning purchase of fuel uh chemical utilities for these all items we are taking our assumption for the cpi index 0.9 cents uh that 's for me i will now hand over to gary thank you cushion i 'll hand over to the network the performance benchmark so um basically the benchmarks are set by the office of local governments and council continues to meet um almost all of these except for the own source operating revenue which is due to the stimulus grant funding um we 're looking at a 42 at a level of 42 percent this uh coming financial year which is below the benchmark of 60 however the assumption is that once the grant stimulus grant funding reduces uh that level will once again lift up above the sixty percent so it 's a short-term pain but um the water and sewer asset renewal ratio um is is to assess the rate at rate they are depreciating and council continues to maintain the benchmark and forecast to continue so i 'll just run through we 've got some slides here with the income statement comparisons from the forecast of this financial year to the forecast of the coming financial year in 2021-22 as previously mentioned we 're forecasting an increased total income of approximately twenty seven point four million dollars made up of two percent rate increase peak rate peak increase 0.9 percent cpi on fees and charges unless statutory an increase in financial assistance grant block grant and block supplementaries there 's a significant increase in grant uh capital grants based on all works completed during the 2021-22 financial year in line with a double asb 15 and a reduction in investment revenue in the lead up to a new gl restructure council staff have consolidated accounts which has led to some expenses increasing in comparison to last financial year and below are is an outline of some of these increases so in the document on public exhibition there are some notes that refer to these changes and i i ask you includes all postage printing cleaning and stationery for all areas of the council giving need for the forecast rise it is noted that the cleaning contract part of the cleaning contract has been included in this consolidation and will be moved as part of ongoing reports to council this is a 64 000 uh change however this does not change the bottom line it will just be moved to contracts advertising for all aspects of council have been consolidated into one line some examples include the weekly council columns community events and recruitment currently the state government has not committed to ongoing assistance in the heritage space council is cognizant of the importance of heritage in the local government area and having the provision of expertise in this field regardless of funding is paramount in continuing this function to assist council is proposing to provide our heritage consultant additional funds to assist the local projects on heritage listed properties it is now requirement excuse me it is now a requirement for all councillors new and returning at the next election to undertake professional development therefore council is required to add 000 for year one of the new term council has had a good year of debt collection during 2021 that staff feel we are able to forecast a reduction in 21.22 hence the reduction there it hardware increase includes new height new hardware for new councillors after the september election hardware for outdoor staff as a result of the new ems transition to assist with processing on site and ongoing hardware updates and the memberships and subscriptions uh this also includes membership for uh new south wales central west jo subscription of cemetery operations library membership and subscriptions development control memberships and as an example so we 've pulled them all into the one area the next slide this the next this slide shows the forecast of substantial operating result being over 12 million both before disposal and both the sports carryovers and before capital are a result of substantial projects in 2122 we have a substantial increase in depreciation of 1.7 million dollars for the 21 22 financial year due to these new projects there 's a forecast decrease in net gains from disposal of assets this is prominent completed in the 2021 financial year we are forecasting minor carryovers into 2122 at this point in time there is a decrease in transfers proposed from restricted relating predominantly to the sewer treatment plant expenditure being sourced through brands i 'll hand over to the technical services director who can outline some of the projects planned capital projects planned for next financial year during 2122 as lynette has mentioned there is quite a substantial um array of projects that the council has uh obtained through um quite a vast amount of funding that 's been made available through the state government predominantly and uh and federal governments respectively some of the projects are listed and it 's really a snapshot there are a fair few more than these but these are certainly some of the the key point projects so the 0.1 is talks to the safer roads program which will address safety upgrades on two particular roads this year we did receive 1.95 million grant for abercrombie road that 's being split over two financial years and this year we 're spending 1.65 million dollars on that to do between black springs and and paddling yards in that particular location so that involves curb widening bitumen seal guard rail signage and new line marking next financial year on that particular job when i talk about line marking audio tactile line marking as part of the safety component will be installed on that particular road center line uh predominantly again uh addressing some of the uh the key attributes of safety upgrades for crummy road the second part during 2122 either throat council is expecting a a further grant of around about 587 000 to do uh safety improvement works on the bidder road um in the vicinity or around boston point road um which again is some curved widening uh guard rail bitumen ceiling and line marking signage improvements work fixing local roads 0.2 talks to campbell 's river road most of the community is quite well aware by now there 's about 23 kilometers of road they 're being addressed at a cost of around 5 million uh castle 's currently halfway through that work with regard to stabilizing um certain sections of the pavement which uh have heavy haulage which is known as a a common uh link between obviously obama and the forestry corporation areas for supply of timberington uh council recently also received another announcement through fixing local roads around about a little over four million dollars to do work on arcstone roads and barricade raising respectively that work will also be undertaken into next financial year so those two those two works will work uh you know in terms with one another and it 's expected camels of a road will be completed by december uh this calendar year and again arkansas will uh certainly and then barricade rose will work through uh next financial year in terms of trying to bring them to uh to a completed state raise the recovery uh some funding will be spent on mosaic road this year um there is some preparation work currently being undertaken this year with regard to gravel reshooting on the abercrombie road end and next year or next financial year we 'll see some some blacktop being rolled out on that that particular road uh the repair program council uh has put together regard to receiving another 800 000 or 400 000 income match with 400 000 councils funds to bring together an 800 000 program to to address a further three kilometers of road on on the earth road between butterfactory lane uh due east towards the general cave so again adding on some already uh good works that have uh provided upgrades to the road which we 'll see then again again a better a better improvement in road safety and delivery of you know a better road network on the earth road soberland 's way council has been awarded around about 6.7 million dollars off a program that will be over or undertaken over a period of three years um commencing from 21 to 22 council will undertake the first stage of works on the blows mount road from the over an end heading due east towards mutton falls road so the work will involve uh some land acquisition uh widening of the road pavement um again safety improvements guard run vegetation removal and alike so certainly we would all agree that that road is uh certainly due and as council will be undertaking work on that road for next year uh in the field of roads maintenance council contracts council continues to maintain o 'connell and duck molly roads it 's about 50k a road under a under contract arrangement and council remains committed with transport for new south wales in in in the maintenance area and you know heavy batches repairs flying marketing and any other capital projects they assign on those particular two sections of road open council again as i said we 'll take those works on as part of the 2122 capital works and last but not least mentioned here is another successful result of state government committed to the fixing country bridges program which leads to council with swallows nest road there 's a bridge on swallows in the spray which will be replaced under the timber um timber bridges componentry of the fixing country bridges program which will see a road on a bridge being constructed on a new alignment where the the existing one i think goes across right angles on the road at the minute we will put it on a a light but it will be a dual bridge which will have uh obviously a better outcome with regard to ability to facilitate you know passing cars on the one structure and again on baldrige road there 'll be another bridge which will be constructed to replace an existing timber bridge so we should be able to undertake the work on swallows this road without too much interruption to traffic but whereas wool bridge road we 'll have to probably close that road at the time to traffic so we can install that particular structure so any questions of that well if not i 'll hand over to the plenty of development director to cover off a few more couple projects in that area thanks chris a couple of projects that i 'm involved in is the finalization of the existing waste facility of the avalon tip as it 's reaching the end of its life moving to a new cell the new cell is made up of eight cells and has an expected lifespan of up to 50 years and that will be done in accordance with our epna the new sewer treatment plant coming on board from the new financial year the um the pound will be relocated to the the waste facility and that will also include new working conditions and amenities for the staff at the waste depot council has also received funding from the new south government drought stimulus package for the community hub combining the library and the community center into one facility and obviously having to engage consultants to prepare detailed plans and drawings uh planning approvals and with construction anticipated to commence before the end of the current financial year with completion anticipated by the end of 2022 so thank you and i 'll hand over to the general manager yeah thank you damian um council in this space also continually is looking for grant opportunities to support the redevelopment of the sporting precinct currently the new south wales state government has contributed 2 million to the to the project and council is looking to for grant funding to support the relocation of this project as well as contributions from partners um in this space so an application has been launched with so council isn 't the assessing authorities isn 't the determining authority here and it 's it 's now with them for assessment so that 's a that 's a just a quick overview of the capital projects that we have lined up for 2122 and as you can see there 's quite a number um once again the screen only gives a snapshot of what they are um there is quite significant programs for the community the council alike moving forwards of 2021 up at 21.22 um this moves us into the town improvement levy for 2122 council has forecast levy town improvement levy projects in accordance with its community strategic plan and its delivery program they form part of the operational plan each year and they make the cost of the work service facilities or activities within the town improvement district on the screen there is a number of potential projects that we are looking at for the for this financial year they include there 's a common the common fund um some kermit gutter works which are allocated for the program from dudley street to to on as well as others there 's the beautification program that the council has put together to look at how we can better utilize natural uh and uh trees for a beautification project along our streets and avenues um there is also some footpath construction there 's a provision around a bulk of goods collection there 's a there 's a a community hub fit out contribution that 's been proposed should council consider it however it 's it 's got to be stated this point in time that prior to the adoption of a 21 financial plan or an operational plan council will need to outline their preferred projects following the exhibition community consultation and feedback and current resolutions so what we 're saying here is if you add up those projects they sit well and truly above what 's proposed to be collected it is not anticipated that council is going above and beyond that that levy that 's been raised and they will need to make a decision on how they want to spend that money i 'll now pass over to the mayor to outline the rating year 2021-22 council has adopted a rating structure which in complying with the local government act 1993 maintains the equity of the present structure this chart that you can see on the screen shows the different rating categories that make up the total rating revenue and how they contribute to the total revenue collected farmland contributes 46.21 residential contributes 23.65 rural residential 16.42 non-urban 4.01 and business 9.72 it should be noted that with an average increase of 2 there will be assessments that have a higher than expected increase these will be a result of land value changes through the supplementary listings and land transfers and revaluation of land from the valuer general undertaken in 2020 there is an opportunity um for landowners to question the value valuer general 's department 's assessments and that can be done privately through their website i 'll now hand over to director of finance we met to go through the statement of revenue policy thank you so the uh statement of revenue policy covers um a few items one of them being the oberon mayor and councillors fees for 2122 and um maximum renumeration allowed by the tribunal and as i said previously the rate at the moment is currently set at 0.9 per cent increase this will be reviewed during the public exhibition period as the tribunal will is due to release its ruling and in accordance with council resolution at the april finance committee will adjust the operational plan at that time the fees and charges as i mentioned previously as well is 0.9 cpi unless statutory and the investment interest forecast is very conservative accordance with the reserve bank of australia forecast and council 's investment policy and the investment policy is due for review shortly i 'll hand back to the general manager thank you lynette um this brings us to the current pandemic that we still need to cater for regardless of whether we think it 's over or not council has put a contribution within its up draft operational plan um as as a 137 thousand dollar potential spend in the 2122 operational plan should council continue or should oberon continue to have no impacts from the from the um from the pandemic it 's considered will move from a deficit into a surplus however being mindful of the current situation it would be poor um pleading of us not to cater for a provision that relates to the covered pandemic at this point in time so we have put an allocation of of um 137 800 this year which is down from the just below 200 000 from last year however that will be something that will be moved in and out of our operational plan through poorly budget reviews um that sort of brings us to the end of of the um of the discussion and where to from here is that well council resolved to put the document on exhibition until the 4th of june 2021 so we 'll accept submissions up until that date plans are available on council 's website and should you wish to speak to anyone in regards to any of the matters within the plan please contact the the administration center in order to do that um i 'd like to take this opportunity to encourage all the community to put their submission in um as it 's consider those submissions and now is the time to do that so i 'll now pass over to the mayor just for a wrap-up thank you gary and i too would encourage all of our community to read these documents and put in a submission comments from residents will be considered at the june before the resolution of this document at the june ordinary council meeting and please remember this is your document and as gary said if you do need any further clarification or information please feel free to contact either myself another counsellor or the general manager it 's better to be informed than non-informed the zoom the zoom now will cease so we thank you for attending and we will now take questions from the members of the public present _"

apologies to see one apology this evening counsellors uh councillor danny is applying for legal accents could have someone to nominate that that if he accepted please councilman gibbon all in favour harry thank you any declarations of interest this evening councillors thank you we have one presentation this this evening we 're here to welcome john o 'malley i 'm pretentious who will present us a summary of the 2019-20 audited financial statements welcome john the presentation is is very relaxed informant so if you have questions about something i 'm talking about please feel free to interrupt at that time i 'm uh a partner in the audit firm in been doing local government about 25 years we act as contract audit agents to the auditor general 's office so they actually sign your opinion and are your orders but we we do the legwork for them on their behalf so that 's that 's the background to uh how we uh how we work with the audit office they also play a a leading role in terms of setting priorities and particular areas of emphasis so i 'll start the presentation just looking at some of what the audit office is doing because aside from financial statement orders they also do special uh what 's known as performance audits on on particular areas so cladding of buildings or operation award facilities credit card management things like that might be areas where they they might dive in and look at a handful of councils and make some uh findings and recommendations to the industry i 'll then focus on oberon 's uh 2020 financial statements look at what the operating result was and and what was behind it and then just look at some of the ratios in the financial i often uh find with the ratios that it takes a little bit of um perspective to make sense of them and if you look at them in isolation you could actually draw quite erranus conclusions so having some perspective makes a difference in the 8th so that 's where we can cover shouldn 't be any more than about 10 or 15 minutes but as i say if there 's questions far away if i can 't answer them i 'm happy to take my notice so areas that the order office are focusing on um in the current year and which will appear in the the reports parliament which they issue in march this year uh are on fairly typical areas they 've covered things like asset valuations and software security for quite a while um fraud controls i.t there 's there 's been a focus on that and it 's not going away and and with attacks that have been taking place notably on news i 've lost transport or on anu uh i think the the the reason that that 's not going away is quite protocols and practices is going to remain a couple of others that they 're looking at things like procurement shared services and collaboration and i suppose some of the learnings from the amalgamated councils around that could be enlightening too they 're also going to do uh performance which we should see reports on this year around credit card management uh develop the contributions and voluntary planning agreements and procurement so those are the areas they 're going the other one that uh which will be of interest i guess which we 'll send the preliminary findings on and i think finding that one was last year there hasn 't been any management from dpi for at least six years so they certainly don 't pull their punches when they report in terms of uh oberon there were a couple of things which were significant in this year 's order and several things i mean i think the obvious one is of course the pandemic and you 're all well aware of how that affected council but aside from that it was a fairly big year it was the first as the partner on the oberon audit so i don 't come although i 've got a lot of experience in local government audits and particularly in the central west of the state i didn 't have any background in oberon 's particular circumstances so there 's a bit of coming up to speak there um we had a couple of new accounting standards and normally that that isn 't terribly notable but there are ones which have a big impact and the first of those was to do with how how we recognize our income in the past it used to be that when you receive the money or the right to receive money associated with the grant then you recognize the income and that that gave us some problems because people were of the view all hang on i get the money this year and then i spend it next year and so i 'm looking fabulous this year in terms of my result dreadful next year um there 's no matching so the the change in the accounting transactions sort of came back more to the matching obligations attached you recognize a liability for those obligations until you 've satisfied them and at that point you recognize the revenue so timing of income recognition uh changed with these standards and that was quite substantial the other one didn 't impact oberon we did the exercise with the council 's finance team to to see whether it would have an impact and it was to do with leasing background to that one there 's a gentleman by the name of sir david tweedy who 's an englishman who sits on the international mechanic standards board and he was on a jet one day and obviously fairly bored because it struck him that he 'd never flown in a jet that sat on the balance sheet of the airline he was flying with and that seemed ridiculous so we we saw this international standard developed with leased assets because most airlines leased their fleet and they don 't own it these deaths were coming onto the balance sheet and so what it meant was that if you had uh buildings or uh heavy equipment of things that you were a rent expense that you paid for them now you brought to account what was known as a right of use asset and a corresponding liability for the lease plans that you would have to make so it brought them onto the balance sheet so while it might have a big effect for airlines who were busy being affected by other more pressing matters at the time it also impacts because we all councils have to apply the same international accounting standards it also impacts on councils so in abroad 's case we did the exercise to establish whether or not there were leases that needed to be recognized in that fashion and there weren 't but um nonetheless it 's quite involved because for things like say garbage collection if there 's a track dedicated to the use of just you know over on show council 's garbage collection then there 's an implicit piece even though you 're not painting the truck or controlling the truck so there 's a lot of work to do to establish that so those couple of accounting stands were quite a bit um [Music] as you 're probably aware their councils have to value their infrastructure assets and last year was the year in which the roads bridges footpaths and stormwater drainage all have to be recognized which is by far the biggest asset category both in value and in complexity of the valuation exercise so that was done uh the the outcome of that was that um uh there was a net decrease in the carrying value of just over 26 million and the reason for that decrease was that the unit rates which had previously been used for valuing the pavement of unsealed roads uh were found to be substantially higher and and the adjustment to those unit rates resulted in a reduction in the the overall value of the infrastructure so that was the net outcome tuning into the the operating result of the council for the year we look at it in in two ways we look at the underlying operating result and we look at the operating result before capital grants and contributions and the reason that we do that is because the capital funding can can big in a map when it 's when it is received it can distort the results quite a bit whereas the the operating the operating result before capital amounts tends to be more stable in its outcome so the the results that we saw were that before capital funding we had a deficit of 317 000 which was pretty much a break-even result and after a capital funding we had a surplus of 1.3 million looking at the income side of what drove that rates income as as you can with through lift experience you 'd be aware doesn 't increase significantly from year to year in the absence of a special rate variation through ipad so modest growth there just a 220 000 increase in our rates income to four and half million operating grants and contributions uh were down a little on the previous year down a lot on the year prior when uh recovery funding dropped away capital grants and contributions were also down a bit on on the prior year down by about 1.1 million on the previous year the big one affecting the 2020 year meeting she was saying has has turned the corner in 2021 was to do with the rms road works that council 's been doing so when we as a council do work on state roads we get paid for it and particularly if we use the council workforce to do it we have the opportunity to make some margin on that and and that has a big impact on the result and you can see that the tapering off in the 2020 year of that rms money uh was significant and that was a big driver of that drop in the result annual charges so things like access charges to water and uh cabbage collection and sewer services uh much like rates don 't increase significantly so only a forty thousand dollar increase from one point four six million to one point five million there interest revenue is falling away as as the return on council 's investments is sort of being repriced each time we renew an investment and with the reserve bank at their february meeting indicating that we 're not likely to see any upward movement for going to have likely to see much movement in that interest revenue and other income is a little more variable it 's contains things like uh proceeds in profits on sale of fires of plant equipment on the other side of the equation the expenses um kicking off with the employee costs they were up a little uh partly through an increase the employer cost says the reporter in the council 's financial statements aren 't simply the wages that includes uh things like workers compensation insurance uniforms training uh superannuation and the like so it 's it 's an amalgam and it 's also um uh affected by how the the nature of the work the council 's doing so if if council 's workforce is constructing assets those wages get capitalized into the value of the asset and don 't appear as an expense and if you 're doing maintenance it 's an expense and and that 's how the wages are reported so last year was a year in which there was more of an emphasis on on maintenance and so that was the other thing which pans out in the materials so you can see the materials expenses were a little bit higher last year than than the previous year again that was due to the focus last year being on on maintenance work if we 'd been doing capital work again those costs would go into the value of the asset and not into the expense depreciation finally has pretty much maxed out we 've seen a depreciation expense of 3.95 million up from 3.92 the previous year but as a result of that valuation of the biggest infrastructure past having been done and actually resulting in a small decrease we shouldn 't see further increases in depreciation next year so we 've probably reached something of a plateau in that regard on depreciation expense borrowing costs reflect the fact that there was no change in the uh sorry no new borrowings taken out and that the interest cost on the existing borrowings is what we 're seeing there and then other expenses were up a little bit there were things like the uh the outsourcing of the running of the pool to the ymca costs like rfs levy which went up and uh and some insurances which also went up which has driven other expenses up from where they were in the previous year so total expenses came in just over 18 million up from 17 million the previous year [Music] looking at council 's level of cash and investments and you can see it 's broken down into three different uh bars for each year and the first of those is the bright red bar which is your externally restricted money so that money is things like water or sewer money or grant funds that have been received unexpected and so council has that money and and will see the benefit of that money but can 't apply it to different purposes it can only be used for those externally restricted purposes the the next two areas of the money which council has discretion over and it 's either applied internal restrictions where through your operational plan and through your budgeting process you 've set aside money in reserves for particular purposes that might be for capital works plant replacement employee leave entitlements we want this amount of money put to that purpose and so you can change that but it just needs to go back through uh you know through council by resolution and you also have unrestricted money which represents money which is there as a buffer because as has been made apparent with central coast council if you use too much of your unrestricted money and then start eating into your internal restrictions and then touch on your external restrictions financially you end up in a real mess so uh having some buffer and seeing in fact there was quite a bit more buffer there last year than that has previously been uh is i think a healthy sign we 'll probably see in in the current year 's financial statements that you won 't you know see that distinction between uh unrestricted and internally restricted cash so much uh there 's a bit of debate going on at the moment about whether or not it will be reported that way but it 's um yeah whichever way it 's reported it represents money which council has discretion over so oberon 's case because certainly last year with only 82 000 unrestricted cash you were fairly hard up against the margin looking at the first of the ratios and and it 's the unrestricted current ratio and what become what an ordinary current ratio isn 't saying okay for for every dollar of liability we 've got to pay in the next 12 months how many dollars of short-term asset do we have to to meet it with and again this one goes one step further it says unrestricted so the same and and all those um externally restricted assets we have take them aside and the corresponding liabilities so that we 're just looking at at things that we have more control over the benchmarks there 's set it at 1.5 so that the office of local government measure is that you should have a dollar fifty of a short term asset to meet a dollar of liability uh the outcome we saw here was 4.53 uh so certainly well above the benchmark as you have been for the past five years uh and and indicating that councils comfortably due the next is not a ratio but it 's just a measure of your overall external debt uh in in the form of long-term borrowings um the total borrowings at the end of the year just over 2.8 million down from in the 3.3 the previous year there were no new loans taken out in the 2020 year nor in the 2019 year there were repayments of 484 000 and and that 's the principal portion not the total repayment so as you pay down the loans that principal repayment amount will increase and barring further borrowing uh it would see council in a debt-free position in perhaps six years with a low interest rate environment it 's uh it 's perhaps the time to when you 're dead isn 't so scary the next measure that we look at is actually the debt service cover ratio which is a measure of how comfortably a council can pay its debts and what it does is it looks at the total repayments that you have to make principal and interest and it looks it out of your operating income how the ratio the more comfortable you are you can see that when council borrowed 3.4 million in the 2018 year um that the level of comfort dropped uh but the benchmark there is set at two percent council 's coming in at uh pretty much six percent so again indicating uh we 're not excessively burdened with debt this one i do put some story um it 's this ratio is looking at the how effectively councils managed its debt collection so the way it works is it says okay well we started the year and some people hadn 't paid their rates or their annual charges and interest and they had to pay that to us and then we levied the current use rates and so that had to be paid as well so that gave us the total pool of money that can be collected how much of that had not been collected at the end of the year is what this is saying and the outcome there is 10.12 uh it 's consistent with the prior year and and i understand there was a change in collection down to get things happening um but you can see it 's it 's come from better because although the 10 is on the the performance benchmark set by the old certainly what i 'm seeing uh in central western new south wales is is councils uh are nearly that seven and eight percent uh that historically oberon had been at and so i would suggest that 's one where there 's room for some uh some improvements to be made in recovery there it 's not it 's not dreadful it 's certainly still on the on the bounds of the uh the benchmarks but in spite of uh the covert and um the operating performance ratio it 's emotionally it 's it 's a it 's a matter of how well did you control your budget did you spend more money than you generated or did you spend less and it doesn 't always do this but in oberon 's case it actually reasonably approximates your operating result before capital two because you know you can see that this year is the first year if i go back into deficit for the first time in 2020 and it really approximates your operating service operating performance ratio which is it 's trended the same way it doesn 't always happen that way because particularly things like that revenue recognition that i was talking about sometimes the the flow of cash doesn 't match the recognition of revenue um so it 's it 's not always the case that this trends but in this case it 's sort of saying that we we spent marginally more than we uh called in last year and obviously in a one-off situation and after year you know several years where we 've been generating more than we 've been spending that 's um that 's achievable and you 've seen the occasional investments position we suggest that you can fund that uh at least you know for that year and possibly further years but um obviously if that were to continue for several years then that starts to become concerning because we 're spending more than we 're making and you have to live within your means the the last ratio i 'll 's trying to to report how well council is is generating uh money that it can control so if you 're heavily dependent on grant funding your own source income would be very low if you have lots of entrepreneurial activities if you 're doing land development if you 're doing things like rms roadworks then you tend to have a higher operating fan source operating at the eurasia uh overruns is actually quite good it 's it 's coming in at 63 uh the benchmark there is 60 and a lot of councils in rural areas uh don 't achieve the benchmark um you know the easy thing to say when that happens is that well look it 's much better than spending someone else 's money that than our rate payer so you know the longer we 're spending other people 's money the better we are but it tends to also mean that the overall pool of money you 've got to spend is smaller so by achieving that it suggests that council is effectively generating its own income as well as getting some grants and contributions position it wouldn 't be surprising to see that ratio dip but uh you know at that point i guess if we maintain that baseline of what council is generating and then we 're getting that on top we can live that 's that 's just the details of what the numerator and denominator are better so finally in terms of the the ordered opinion that gets issued there 's actually multiple opinions because apart from the consolidated the council of the council there 's special purpose statements on the individual activities and and other aspects as well uh one one of which is what 's known as the the conduct of order report where it sort of provides a bit more commentary those reports were issued there without any qualification which means that uh the financial statements were satisfied that they presented your view of the operating results and the uh and the financial position of council it was a it was a push um we were a bit tight on the deadline i mean the pandemic certainly impacted things the valuation fell behind a bit particularly when the south wales to do some of their work so uh it was it was down to the y but all of the reporting and disclosure requirements were met as we do the audit and we 're dealing with things like new processes for making payments and receiving money and that sort of thing we 'll raise items with management sometimes just in conversation sometimes more formal three management letters that 's happened during the year and those management leaders typically go to the audit risk committee and that 's been acted upon in the fashion that you would expect and know so i think now there 's a good opportunity to acknowledge lynette in the other room and uh and the finance team for having got that over the line in a tough year with a lot going on having covered that though if there 's questions either on the order or on the financial side so i 'd look to take jones thank you any questions councilman cuban um thank you john just so if i can if we go to the unrestricted uh current ratio i 'm assuming getting to that ratio they add both together so it takes out the external restrictions exactly but it includes the internally restricted and the unrestricted yeah yes yes yes and the corresponding liabilities that 's right um so you said in the accounting stand in the future it there may not be it may not be a requirement of council to include internally restricted obviously that may be of benefit to councillors because we obviously want to ensure that in we have a pool of money that deals with all things from employee liabilities and all the other things internally restricted will continue to be reported okay the unrestricted uh may not be split out in the financial statements right so it would it would simply be a line item other in the in the internal restrictions okay so that 's that 's the current proposal right okay so it would still list the categories of unrestricted i 'll be internally restricted correct right okay um noting our [Music] debt servicing ratio i think 5.87 say six percent if council was to add let 's say a borrowing of 7.5 that how would that affect our debt servicing ratio i know you 'd have to do a bit of a calculation i would as i said i couldn 't give you that one at the top of my head it would reduce that debt service carbon cover ratio i suppose if and what 's the and what 's the cover ratio 2 sustainable the uh yes it is uh the service cover ratio uh with the 3.4 million in borrowing dropped from 12.3 out down to nine so that dropped it by about three percent so if it goes seven you can see that dropped by six percent that would take you to zero right very very very rough okay um so that would take us under what is basically the oil you know in a situation where most of you know that unrestricted cash or you know is put to debt services right um obviously obama 's a small council we have gone into a deficit last year we had a relatively small one noting that employee expenses increased by about 500 000 from the previous year 2019 um staying reasonably stable apart from minimal increases due to cpi which is probably going to be minimal for the next few years and and costs and charges um remaining relatively stable um that we 'll be able to sort of cover our expenses adequately in the financial statements note five now 5a it provides a further breakdown of the salary and wages yes so the actual salary in wages expense last year was 5.6 million 12.69 and the previous year was 5.53 right so the the although the bottom line increase we went from 5.9 to 6.4 the wages component uh moved by a little over here so does that mean more people put annual leave long service leave i 'm assuming the workers come premium balance it comes back to that split between maintenance work and california capital because the capitalized wages were lower this year than in the previous year so the actual wages figure reported was higher even though the the actual salary and wages are now only varied by about a hundred thousand right the bigger movements in in there were things like workers compensation uh and a little bit more in employee uh employee leave costs and some sometimes that 's through people hitting anniversaries and you know one service leading festivals and that sort of thing so we don 't obviously know the ultimate position in relation to capital grants etc this year and how much of um employee costs will be amortized into that site indicating capital works um but we wouldn 't want our employee costs to increase to that magnitude again i would assume well i think in in relation to how much is capitalized that that probably doesn 't matter so much because i mean the the budget that we adopt is is more on a cash basis so whether we 're constructing assets or whether we 're doing maintenance we 're still paying wages out of the same amount of cash and so if we 're doing capital work our wages figuring that in the accounts will look lower and our operating results will look better but from a cash perspective we haven 't saved any money by doing maintenance work it 's it 's it 's you know same time so that 's that 's where i i 'd say these these are for external financial reporting yes your budget and quarterly budget review is where you want to drill in on your expenditure of wages against both your operating and capital budget yeah i 'm just saying that uh we really need a big program on the maintenance because of the storm damage we 've had to our roads and we 're losing value in our roads they 're getting washed about the same maintenance budget it 's going to impact higher on a figure showing there than capital use correct yeah i mean in terms of your external financial report that 's where having some perspective on that is helpful because if you know that we 've been doing a lot of maintenance because we 've had storms it makes sense then that your wages are less going to capital and that impacts on your result but if you 're looking at it cold you 're just thinking oh your waves are going through through the roof any other questions thank you very much very clear for having me in the chamber it 's good to be here good to be back thank you very much item seven questions from the public due to the code in accordance with newly legislated state government requirements february 2021 ordinary council meeting is closed members of the public and will be available for viewing by zoom facilities the general manager has requested that all questions from the public excuse me be submitted in writing prior to 1 pm on tuesday the 16th of february 2021. members of the public who submit a question to council are permitted to do so provided the following guidelines are adhered to the person lodging the question must advise of their name and in what capacity are acting if the person lodging the question is acting as another person or organization 's agent they must advise counsel if they have their prior consent or authority questions from the public is not an opportunity for debate with elected representatives or staff it 's an opportunity for the community to ask a question in relation to an issue or put a point of view relating to to time constraints a time frame of three minutes per speaker is allocated the general manager will read out any questions submitted at this point in time questions will be taken on notice if not able to be answered this evening and a response provided within a reasonable time frame ask the general manager for questions from the public please thank you mayor at this point in the proceedings have been three questions from the public and i will read them out one at a time and the first one is from jennifer cable who acts as the president of oberon u3a i would like to ask when council is going to deliver on its commitment to provide the community with an area where fitness classes can be held the fitness eff center offers a wonderful facility for those who wish to use machines to aid their fitness regime however the facility does not have any space for fitness classes to be conducted despite many assurances from council that they would have prior to its construction it has been suggested that the space behind the fitness centre will in time priority to this project is council aware there are four u3 classes alone seeking a suitable venue for its balance and bones and pilates classes as well at least what as well at least four other groups in over on which run fitness and yoga classes the u3a classes alone comprise of a minimum of 20 participants the space for fitness classes is urgently needed council assured us that it need that that the needs of this section of the committee would be met this council now going to allocate funds to see this project completed as promised thank you are you going to take that on notice general response happy to take that question on notice madam mayor but i will refer to item 1406 where this section of the um has been adequately looked at in terms of ground funding for a project moving forward thank you the second question madam mayor is from hardy dryham council reported regular routine maintenance having been done on all pumps in the wtp in june july and august an 11 year old pump failed in august in spite of council 's the root causes was announced by council at its august meeting a pump that dosed the potassium peningulate into the raw water to control manganese began to overdose the system causing turbidity issues intruded in town water this pump was bypassed as emergency measure using a different dosing pump deputy kellum announced prematurely on the 17th of november that council would provide a four percent rebate allegedly agreed in closed session in item 1601 in 1601 which was never made public in the minutes as required by the code of meeting practice this decision cannot be found in the video recording and certainly not in the signed off minutes all done in accord to a memo provided by the mayor which residents have not seen motion 33 17 1120 did not deal with the report for the 4 rebate given the pump value was truly operational matter it is more than questionable why the mayor interfered with her email in operational matters directing gm to reimburse claims and likely much more this was done well before the promised report for shadow in october was made public actually this report wasn legal expenses dealing with claims by residents and very likely contributed money to reimburse losses and rates incurred during the murky dirty water issue settled in closed session so not to attract detention the murky dating water issue is still is still of concern to some residents council 's digital media watchful eyes would have noticed reports only a few days ago council 's less than transparent mode of operation is noted making promises they 're not keeping them making decision on shaky data having had staff report wrong facts and drawing erroneous conclusions due to the lack of research lack of knowledge and seemingly lack of care my attached email to the general manager sent in december shows erroneous assumptions and statements made by council what my contribution in december this february contribution does not need to need a response and i 'm not asking for what it 's it is disappointing the council obfuscating what should be discussed openly this is very obvious of what council is doing three minutes general manager please is the greyhound 's comments are noted the third question from uh michael cantaris the i sent an email to all councillors including the mayor regarding my thoughts on fluoridation of our water supply from this email i 'd like to ask council the following questions one will council inform residents in advance of the commencement of the fluoridation of our water supply two will council information inform us of what exactly is being put into our water three will council inform us of maximum dosage indications thank you we all have the right to be informed and therefore make choices um so in a meeting held with the mayor on the 28th further this meeting i 'd like to ask the following questions one will council provide florida water water only supplied to points in town such as the showground common car park where people in our community who wish to drink fluoridated water can access it easily two wheel council provide unfluoridated water supplied to points in town such as the showground common and car park where people in our community who do not wish or can 't_''_2496.24 drink florida water can access it easy i look forward to your response i don residents in advance of the commencement for a rotation of our water supply and the answer to that one is yes in accordance with legislative legislative legislative requirements will council inform us of what exactly is being put into our water this is operational and i would press the general manager to take this on notice and respond will council inform us of maximum dosage and the contraindication this again is operational and i will request the general manager to take on notice and respond will council provide fluoridated water only supplied to points in town where people in our community who wish to drink fluidated water can access it easily will council provide unfluidated water supply to points in town uh such as the chagrin or common car park where people in our community who do not wish or can 't_''_2561.52 drink fluoridated water can access it easily i did indeed meet with mr cantaris in january and i committed to requesting information from relevant staff when they returned from leed which was yesterday as this is an operational issue i 've requested that general manager gary wallace issue 's for all the questions thank you page six counselors item eight confirmation of minutes ordinary council meeting 15th december 2020 the recommendation is that the minutes of the meeting held on the 15th of december 2020 be confirmed can i have a mover please counselor people and a second dollar council mcgillin thank you any business arising put the recommendation all in favor encourage unanimously thank you item 901 merrill medinan report the recommendation is that the report be accepted as information councilman kevin thank you thank you any comments counseling thank you madam mayor um certainly a busy month in particular in the relation to correspondence um i must say in reading phase seven about halfway down at the 23rd of january meeting with crown participants i suddenly thought that we the operator of the casino or former operator of the potential operator of a casino in barangaroo maybe moving to over and only to learn later when i read the director of corporate services report that crowd is a is a network for female business people so i was very pleased i didn 't think that maybe thinking of operating uh in oberon and creating a new business opportunity welcome your business council absolutely um if i could manamer the top of page nine um i was actually wondering who martin smith was and if he was lost in trying to locate obama 's location in relation to the blue mountains mr smith lives in queensland uh he has a former association with oberon and he was having the conversation over a drink with a friend and they were having a discussion as to whether oberon was actually in the blue mountain so he quickly sent off an email to me and i quickly responded thank you madam maverick clarified that um halfway down page nine um the 23rd december vivian clark ferrano raised concern about no scan code being available over on pool and something about unfrank materials from oberon shire residents i mean i thought i 'm frank referred to companies paying unfrank dividends they didn 't have tax related to those untracked materials this is what um put in her female and that 's exactly frank tom thinks she means he 's unstamped understand a stamp on it so she was wondering where it came from she thought it might have come from council and i assured that the student thank you madame um and i know um about three quarters of the way down that page nine sixth of january um the work of sergeant al johns and i i do know that um i underneath this stuff a couple of nathan 's friends come up from sydney and they 're actually breathalyzed at mount david by sergeant al john and i think that is the first time that there has ever been a breathalyzer at mount david vladimir so i do think he must be doing his job um on the 7th of january madame era outside the meeting i might talk to you in relation to the issue with telstra because i know it 's commented before there are other issues at varuga yeah um on page 11 second item down 29th of january um i note this matter of the macquarie subdivision has been going on for some time is there any any potential resolution of that um this correspondence that mr mrs brunton made of council planning staff and this was the legal advice we received back to them um i 'm sure the general manager in conversation could have alerted me to okay i realized okay i think that 's all that in there thank you and i commend uh i commend the uh report for the the merrill minute report for acceptance thank you council helen uh madame please note that um oberon chad graham trust yeah uh you had a meeting with him on the fourth of february um can you give us a perhaps a price of that um it was a meeting um they hadn 't the trust haven 't or happened at that point in time formed their committee yet so it was just a general meeting for us to sort of have a chat about um offering our support or reinforcing the fact that council was you know happy to support the committee and when they get going and what their vision was and how we would go about having a regular meeting just this kind of thing so it was really and just make sure they knew that we they had councils for support the information provided by studs in relation to the water usage and water restrictions is that information available to all councils uh yes i thought he sent it to all councillors i can certainly afford it the other comments on them if you 're having problems with telstra and you 're finally trying to get onto some system that fix it you get a recording at the end of it if you haven 't responded in five days we consider this fixed that needs taken up it 's it 's not right because your landline can still be down and you can 't can 't_''_2966.8 get to somebody because half the time you 're talking about someone that 's not in australia but that that part of the system that telstra has needs to be taken away what do they say you get what you mean so they say if you haven 't responded within five days we 're doing that to fix that it comes off their repairs and it 's a real problem they they an ongoing um it 's an ongoing problem and more and more of our community are having issues and i can see that councilman mckibben 's got his hand up more and more of our community are having issues with this and we 're trying to do some advocacy where we can with this gathering information and council mckinnon oh sorry madame i was just thinking that um i i agree with um council mccarthy i wondered if we could be pruned to look at maybe having a meeting with people who are concerned about the telstra issue and then having as soon as we can do a delegation to our federal member i know the federal government doesn 't own telstra but they do have some sway over or um and the idea of grouping ideas and getting ideas from everyone made what the best avenue is from people who 've successfully got into or been able to raise issues with telstra i know telstra says on the one hand that they 're bringing all call centers back to australia i didn 't hear that and on the other so there 's some contradictory things there um well i did have a conversation with bathurst and that seems not to be the case okay but happy to take i think that because you can take that off fooling ideas another thing is with your landline with older people like myself is if you haven 't got power you haven 't_''_3082.16 got a fan and most people that i speak to um want to sidestep andrew to his input i know protocol says we 're going to go through him but we should be talking is it member [Music] he 's in charge of the telstra side of things and he 's the one we should be able to meet with you okay thank you councilman okay just saying a small ups in the phone could give you that service but they own the bean phone in those cases uh it 's not a problem that 's that 's particular to over and either or something so we 're not the only ones having issues so maybe a combined effort might be like but it is something that we are giving the money out for these towers and the towers don 't sit on top of the hill to give the best range so there 's something fishy going on you 'd say i can tell you councillor that [Music] the federal government is reviewing the criteria now for allocating licenses for towers so there is some work being done in that space i realise that but it 's happening it won 't continue to happen okay well that 's good is that it put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 12 item 1001 notice of motion 1001 over on my stepper motion is that council allocate funding to tidy up the overall tip the council complete the office and wc facilities at the overall tip new shed within a reasonable time frame with thick solar power to supply electricity what does that mean sorry what is that i 'm sorry i don 't know what that means anyway that staff supply plans to councillors on new course new cell to be used methods plans from engaged consultants can i have what that word actually is sorry the before i come to council mccarthy to speak to the motion cars the general manager uh to speak to plans already in place for the waste facility especially around.3 those um so yeah not a problem adam there currently the tip operates under two different approvals one being an old approval for the waste facility and the new one being the extension that council will be moving into in the next period of time um the plans for the new facility sit part of the da and they can be the in time more than happy to provide those two councillors we are looking at options in transitioning towards closure of that primary or old landfill section in lieu of moving into that new section under under the new requirements for waste and we 're also looking at like using those consultants that we 've engaged to deal with how we can transition to that to that new facility as a part of the as a part of that closure council has currently funding in its waste fund to one look towards the closure and to the opening of a grant funding to be able to minimise that expense on our community with the with the progression of the stp there 's been a need to look for a new location to house our pound and our supporting facilities in that area and we 're looking we 've started that process in moving the pound facilities out to the waste facility to in fact have that additional leverage when you move persons in in that locality so we currently have funding to do the things that option one and two allow for and staff plans are currently approved as part of a da for the transition from old to new council mccarthy can i just ask where 's this new cell is it east of the railway line or west of the railway it is east of the royal on the first cell east of the road east of the royal one okay thank you so whether the hole is at the moon correct okay um madame i got to the stage of taking this up i 've taken some photographs pass them around things are disgraced out there there facilities the people go to a toilet that 's on a set of words and the other day when the lady was out there supervising the tip i thought this is it 's all right men put up with it but we we had a lady from the parks of gardening out there filling the void of something it it 's just not good enough and like we don 't expect the uh dog pen part finished but surely goodness there should be a wc and a shower out there for them so they can go out there and freshen up when they go to go home as for the tip i don 't know why it hasn 't been covered over um you know we 've had bruce mcdonald people this position of supervising the tips being there someone 's been paid but it hasn 't been done the rubbish is out there there 's the old logs up the back surely goodness can 't_''_3481.04 we get permission from the epa or someone to put them all in an eating firm or something the logs that have been up tips not run right we get good money coming in we have point aways coming in on monday and tuesday with a 20 meter compactor that should be given us something like eight hundred dollars for the two days we have um boards coming in um and with the morrison low that was um suggesting in the morrison load report that we use backloads that hasn 't been implemented we we should be back loading some of the rubbish or overburden from the side of the road and filling the tip and cover it over make it look decent but some of them trenches have been open for ages but the thing just looks a disgrace and i thank goodness we don 't go for tiny cans but we have the money coming in that should be able to cover some of this there shouldn 't be a great dip in the thing um you have the board been coming in and what it should be about six hundred dollars alone is that i know i 'm not allowed to have that information due to the privacy act but if money in this tip fund so i i just think you know what 's going on why is it so much a disgrace um we had forty thousand dollars didn 't we come in last year for scrap metal we suggested that we go to the living treasures but we 're told it had to be spent at the tip and you know like it 's just it 's a mess out there anyway i i think we can do much better and do we pay for the cardboard to be taken away or is it a recyclable thing through centro it 's a it 's a contract but do we pay or do we make money i know we pay we we do okay because that goes part of your recycling regime that then lessens the impact on your void that you have that you need to deal with i realized that but i thought there 's a certain business in town that actually took it away and they actually shared the profit so and they have compacted cardboard they compacted into a um and they have an arrangement took it off to sydney and got paid for it so you know maybe we 've got to have a look at what 's going on at the tip and um you know anyway but anyway that 's my notification to try and get something tidied up out there but if this the case of the consultant that we don 't know about who it is is looking at doing the hub on the eastern side the railway line then why aren 't we renting the ground out that used this part of um 372 which was rented out before for about a thousand dollars a year like i understand that when shane advertised it to be rented out and then he was told he couldn 't rent it out by yourself it was part of our new hud but you 're saying now it 's not there 's another thousand dollars um there 's a gate out there with a number plate on it 372 it used to be rented out to mark asl and a lot of people inquired about it when the drought was on and shane be used because that 's where the new cell was going so i i can 't understand why we 're not renting that ground out and keeping the fire hazard down myself a number of things there madam mayor that i need to to look at more than happy to take it offline and talk to councillors independently but um you can 't just take money from the waste fund and put it anywhere the waste fund is a restricted fund and you need to deal with it appropriately which is why it can 't_''_3730.24 be used in any other thing but waste unless it was resolved to do so there is the reason why the area that you talk about wasn 't wasn 't um re-leased for the thousand dollars a year was on the basis that having an operation next to the tip forms issues and we own that and we minimise those issues by keeping that property in-house and those those issues don 't then eventuate we also have some monitoring equipment that sits as part of that and that would have been affected by those by we 're doing and putting in place in order to facilitate better opportunities and access at the tip and with that takes time we acknowledge that the tip needs to see an improvement done on it but we 're trying to do that in a way that also allows for it to continue operations we don 't want people at the back of our tip where we have our work place and we have all the heavy machinery but there are processes that we need to put in to make sure that that occurs we are looking at those we have the money within the wait fund to be able to do it and we 're looking to execute those how 's your givens uh yeah just through the chair just a couple of things for my clarification on it is i thought there at one stage it might have been the engineering 's responsibility of years ago and then i thought it was planning it might have changed the planning i know there 'd be cross-responsibilities because there 's machinery there just for a start could you elaborate on one of the things that we have that there 's like a dual responsibility between tech services because there was a crossover in manpower in how it 's it 's looked after um that continues to to occur and it 's something that both the technical services director and the planning and development director are looking at to see whether there is other ways that we can do business okay just yeah one other thing that is to say the toilet issue the plumbing 's already there in the buildings and that sort of needs tidy tiding up and it was one of the comments i made to allow people to have joint or dual purposes to have one toilet for those both purposes is advantageous which is why we 're looking to deal with that together so we 'll get some sort of report back when when you crunch all the numbers and the way it 's going to run thank you thanks for watching um look thank you madam mayor i last several times i 've been out there i have like council mccarthy being attracted the state navigate around getting to the drum muster area is a little bit uh interesting to get around bins and other things to get over there i recall what this was raised with or was raised by the former director of planning shane wilson i might be wrong it was at least a year to 18 months ago when it was originally envisaged the pound would be moved out there and the new facility which was to be built to accommodate both the pound basically the staff looking after the pound and the waste services and the last time i was going i was a bit shocked that it hadn 't been completed and i knew that i thought the funding had been put aside for that and i 'm just wondering what the current timeline is to completion of that building completion of the pound moving out there including obviously the connection of appropriate toilet and bathroom facilities um because the actual building structure as i understand it is now there or in there or partly there yep um so what what is the current timeline for completion um and 's already looking at all of the one two three motions put forth before by accounts were put forward by council mccarthy um so in respect let 's start with if i could motion two what is the timeline for doing the office in wc facilities completion when when is that view being complete um i 'm happy to take you on notice and provide a report back again secondly um when is the pound due to be fully moved their second timeline item and i don 't know if we allocated fixed solar power to supply power to the facility including fpos but is that accommodated within the current funding project um the answer to the last question is no which is why we 're looking for additional funding for for that operation to occur so you 'd but you 'll come back you might have to come back with the rules you 'll come back with a report on costing of that that element of it knowing that the other parts of it um and the part that 's probably not dealt with in council mccarthy 's uh move of the the pound out there to get it absolutely completed um and if i could then go i 'm sorry i 'm not doing this in order to resolve to motion three when is it envisaged that cell the new cell will be open and commence operation if you could provide us a timeline for that as part of that timeline and now if i could go to motion one um what is envisaged for the tidy up of the oberon tip currently to make it a more acceptable facility because i agree with council mccarthy i having been to other tips i i find it particularly untidy so the and and also are we sorry and also noting the morrison low comment about using overburden from other areas to cover it has that also been taken account so if you could comment on those those two so a number of things to digest in that and i 'd rather pull it back through a report to council which outlines that you know in the best possible way however number one allows for councils who have a waste the very thing that we are going through at this point in time a transition away from an old tip to a new tip which has a number of additional requirements attached to it under licensing requirements so our tip is at the point where the the end of life for the old section is coming to a point and it 's done through elevation and height of elevation um which then is captain rehab versus what we need to go through in terms of developing cells and how they are in fact managed more than happy to provide that back to council in a report that outlines what these things would mean okay any other comments come to councillor cable uh thank you madam mayor just just in general and and that 's probably been said but i share counsel mccarthy 's frustration and and it has been raised here at times before i mean we 've had this shed out there built for a long time now some grass growing around it and i 'm not and i really don 't think that that 's an acceptable situation staff working out of the facilities that they 're working from now i mean i i don 't know if work health safety sort of people came along that 's just atrocious the the facility that they expected to work out of there at the thing where the big truck is parked and household rubbish goes into um when that was first put there the area was kept fairly tidy it always looked good the last couple of times that i 've been out there i don 't go out there regularly but the last couple of times i 've been there if there 's rubbish all over the place and that 's just i don 't think that 's acceptable and you can 't expect people that 's customers of the place to leave the place looking tidy when it 's in the state that it is now madam mayor with the movers uh acquiescence i would propose an amending motion which would read something like similar um you 're putting an amendment i am putting them in the general manager provided the march council meeting a report on timeline a timeline for the following a completion of the office and wc facilities at the oberon tip semicolon b the finalization of the installation of the oberon pound at the oberon race depot c oh sorry i knew this would be 2 not see a costing for the installation of solar power to supply power to the over on west depot shed um a timeline and a costing for that um and three a timeline for the commencement of operation of the new cell at over on tip semicolon for a timeline and program for tidying up the existing operating section of the obrad tip which involves principally general waste it 's true garden waste and other non-recyclable waste just just before canceling cuban goes off like um what does what does council 's options around tidying up things on me all right again tidying through a process now the workable area has a number of issues attached to it and i will i 'm more than happy to provide that in a report to council in march about what they are and they aren 't just one sided an understanding on what you mean by tidying up the green waste when ultimately it 's a big area [Music] all right we 'll leave the greenways just i can remove the green waste but my issue is i 've been to other tips and we don 't have you know the photographs circulated by council mccarthy and i said it was salt there 's this thing 's blowing around it 's not all contained properly and i know that the tip has its own challenges because of its topography and other factors but i think we have to do something to improve the appearance and to ensure that we don 't have waste blowing or all around and it its appearance is improved for people attending and it and it and it obviously protects surrounding areas from environmental pollution i need a second of this amendment no second one yes it is council capable do you wish to speak to the amendment uh yeah i realize that it 's fairly uh detailed nation but i think uh it 's it 's along the lines um that we need to the way than what we 've been lately killed madame mayor i 'm quite happy with that uh amendment accepted last uh part four and i suspect that we should have a schedule for making the oberon waste depot a more orderly operation i think it 's orderly but i think mean it 's a bit more normally but i think what we 've got there is madame i 'm happy for a change of words if someone can suggest better words than tidying up i did suggest to prevent environmental pollution surrounding areas or to ensure that waste is properly covered those sorts of concepts i think that 's drilling too far down into detail i think you need something can i make a couple of suggestions the first is a you want a timeline for the following do you want to include them because three and four talk a bit well they all talk about timelines yeah rather than rather than four separate motions it could be an abcd or e yes um the second the second thing is is that a timeline on the program for tidying happy to work with that given that i know what you 're trying to achieve and um what i provide you can then debate or talk about on the basis of what i provide to you and the final one is is that the costing and timelines if you councils look in their business paper they 'll know that council looking to lodge grant applications to do that so that makes it very difficult for the march meeting to provide that timeline on costings for the installation such things when you 're looking to secure grant funding to do so which is a sports right that would be a costing and timeline on the installation of solar power to supply the lease depot shed now more than happy to provide councils with an understanding on what that means more than happy to supply councils with information on the things that that you 've asked for however this will need to be done in a in a way that council is also aware of the costs associated with doing that so what i 'd also like to do in that timeline to move this beyond what we were otherwise moving towards sorry just respond generally i thought all but the solar power um was basically being considered by the general manager in any event and was in budget well what what i indicated was that the waste fund gets developed yes to do a number of things including you know the purchase of of way bridges and closing tips and opening new tips and there is a cost associated with doing that which gets borne by a reserve each year as i indicated there we have a current level of funds which we are applying for on a 50 50 component to in fact do a number of things at that facility but i don 't want to do them twice so a pound with a toilet and a meal room and those sort of things are being included in that in that application to not only not only um require appropriate servicing for the pound and the facilities there but also the tip because of the same location what i can see here is you 've got point a which the office is the internals of the office the shed has been completed at this point but i 'd like to bring back a report i 'll just give you an overview well that 's basically provide a report correct but it 's a top one okay i 'll provide a report it 's the it 's the word timeline that 's causing the issue because of the grant funding it 's the multiple grant funds that could be used to support the closure of a tip versus the opening of a new tip which makes it difficult to provide a timeline because you don 't know whether you 're going to get the grant funding i will give an indicative timeline any costings associated with doing such a thing indicative timeline is acceptable yeah and i don 't mind if it 's a subject of funding but that 's what matter matter i think as you said i thought a completion of the office and wc facilities within that i thought that was already funded am i wrong the funding that we are searching for is to complete those shed without a wc it was to build a shed for a pound yes without a stubborn you said yeah that 's correct it doesn 't change the fact that i 'd like to bring back a report on these things to allow you to get an understanding better than what you have now and could i ask for a third item maybe um three um current i suppose it 's current unrestricted funds that exist within the waste fund okay are we happy there with point d the timeline and program for tidying up i think this is where we started but this needs to be rephrased right now uh program and schedule for improving the operating the operation of the waste depot cover whatever you choose to do that because that 's the actual outcome you want and appearance operational appearance that 's the my issue is what is your expected appearance for the current flower yes that is a part of the tip that 's completed and look at the rubbish but we don 't expect that and i i personally expect that it should be an over and that 's the way it 's retained okay counselors your consent indicates your rehabilitation program that you need to undertake as part of a landfill closure and it 's not that there 's a help there is a lot more to it than just that and that will come back in i 'm happy to provide the the requirements outlined in the in the transition concept councilman gibbon and councillor are you happy with what that looks like that amendment well i don 't think it 's necessary to have point four but if the mover wants to leave it there on a second i think it 's about thirty thousand dollars we charging to literally go to other places three times to charge us isn 't it supposed to try and sort of compromise things i 'm just wondering where it sits with revenue and the cost to run through the chair the cost are on the landfill is is not cheap um however i think it 's cost recovery i 'd just like to support what kerry said there that we look into the fees are that 's turning up with this rubbish on in other words i think there 'll be an opportunity for that when we discuss these and charges as part of the operation no no i don 't want the price to go up all i want to know is is i tried to get in touch with the director yesterday but some of them bins that have come in there come on monday and tuesday and i i i believe that they 're coming with rubbish doesn 't belong to avery but because of their fees but we take the maybe four hundred dollars for that bin is that appropriate or would it be better that we say you come and just pick up the open rubbish you get what i mean because i 've spotted as a thing called rural bin service it 's coming from over lagoon way over the wood actually downs but it doesn 't go to bathurst with its waste it comes here we we we 're providing the service for the abram people and my reason for starting all this is it 's been over be stopped and and this ground that was taken up this block of land like i said 372 that are conflicts with whatever what about the uh um leonardo to the north it 's farming what are we conflicting there too or whatever i can 't see why this land can 't_''_5276.639 be rented out and cut the bushfire danger back and we get some money there might be monitoring posts in there but aren 't they on a post similar to the noise monitor and if we want it in rainwater do you know what i mean like look we are not running this right and i don 't accept what the manager has said because this has been where 's the report this has been going on for two years and the other day well it must have been because the land hasn 't been released for nearly two years has it back for lease when we knocked it on there that we weren 't that was nearly two years ago and shane said when i checked with him why it wasn 't being released because we 've this for two years have we through the chair we have consultants on our tip all the time because okay the requirements of our licence under the epa requirements that 's to finalize the new cell no that 's for the ongoing operations of your current self okay and what i can 't understand is also with the design from the consultant or whatever there 's a conflict with the new fence of winner that i i understand this and you fence went up to separate different things that the council staff can what same does that was that a part of the consultant 's recommendation or not council 's lay down area has been established there for now over five years yeah as a result of product that used to be stored at the industrial land okay but there 's a new fence that went up that was built by a contractor that from lithgow we don 't use locals anymore apparently but anyway there the the lay down area is now secure so okay you can 't access the tip through the weigh down area okay thank you this recommendation madame i 'm happy to add in this if um head to the report five and uh a a comment or a report on the required buffer zone required around the tip of the necessity why we can 't develop i don 't think has that needs to be in the motion i think if the general manager is going to bring back a report that the other thing i would like to do is what we haven 't done and we don 't do when we do our fees and charges is actually in our only talking relation to the tip what we do need to do and i i i i 've heard similar things to what council mccarthy was saying in that um we need to ensure that the fees we 're charging um are of a nature that they 're similar to other tips and we 're not lower so that people are coming so back to the operational plan that we will be discussing please and challengers quite soon absolutely but what we do not get when we look at the fees and charging for the same rubbish to be deposited i think we need to look at that because if we don 't then what we may be finding is that people are coming to oprah i understand but counselors can do their own due diligence around that by finding that information themselves or i 'm sure the general manager would take that on board if you could take that on board gentlemen i do think we need to look at that because um whether it 's done before we do look at the operational charges and fees section or whether we do it as part of this report um i think it 's a necessary exercise especially in relation to the tip i 'm not missing talking about other things i 'm more than happy to bring back an analysis on it but i want to do it in report form not speaking out of school i 'm not asking the general agent to do it speaking out of her okay i 'm going to put this amendment as in four parts as it is there all in favor of the in favor of the motion thank you councillors that 's carried page 13 counselors item 1002 costing community hub and i will note that the author of this motion is councilman kevin not council mccarthy the notion is there that council staff provide advice on the following aspects of the design option 1a for the community hub a the cost of fit out not currently allowed for in the weber costing including but not limited to library shelving and racking loose furniture for library meeting rooms auditorium seating and for the atrium area technology hub area and any other areas requiring loose furniture point three any additional built-in furniture such as library or reception desks b the cost of operating the hub on a yearly basis including but not limited to staff costs utility costs water electricity gas including that used for air conditioning and heating cleaning costs maintenance cost winter cleaning costs and garden maintenance the comparison should be made of these costs against these against the current cost for library and the robert river community center on a yearly basis a mover please come from the given in kevin um thank you madam mayor i think the promotion is fairly self-explanatory um i think um as i 've indicated before i think it 's a it 's good process especially with large pro projects the council obviously look at what what 's known as um through life support costs of the project into the future uh when looking at it because it may not be us it may be future councils who will obviously bear the burden of what it 's going to cost to run these new facilities which are fantastic but we need to know what additional costs it 's going to be each year and that 's why we need to know and also we need to have an idea of increased maintenance costs i 'm not only talking about the operating costs but incorrectly there 's increased maintenance costs and also an idea of if there are going to be major maintenance requirements in you know 15 to 20 years it doesn 't relate so much to probably this facility but it might the sewer treatment plant or it might be the sporting the really do need utility costs could be a lot could be higher some costs in fact may end up being lower having a new building facility it might be better insulated there might be benefits as well as extra costs but i just think we need to have this and do it for all our major projects i think it 's good process most companies do it and most obviously government usually does it so i think for most of our major process project we should should be looking at this through life cost support you know so that we know what it 's going to cost to operate and maintain into the future and as we 've already got existing facilities here what we 're really talking about is there a delta cost comparison you know dollar cost fairly self-explanatory elsewhere i think about me um total cost of ownership was a um a difficult process uh but it 's a necessary process um i would expect in fact that some of the costs would go down with a new building um but there will be changes and understanding to our budgeting our building the budget council yeah comments with the recommendation all in favor thank you 14 1101 council and delegates reports rfs bushfire management committee meeting recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please council mccarthy thank you kevin thank you mccarthy um the reason why i included madame air is state forest i can 't think of his name david somebody mentioned that they 're going to start moving the plantations back from the roads which doesn 't mean they 're going to have less fines per hectare i suppose but one of the beauties of that is it it 's probably going to provide us with a better runoff anyone that 's seen the vines has been cut down on lowe 's mount therefore tillis you actually see the water run down the road and to my knowledge that doesn 't run down there for 24 years so it 's actually running down there comes under the point and runs down towards fragable road and the other one was the um rfs are now acknowledging the uhf time and i think you start off on channel 15 and then if you 're site pacific say you 're working out a burrito where we 've got that problem then you organise to go to a different channel so which has been a good those points i think they 're uh they 're important for oberon especially the reuse of the uhf radio which was a matter of a huge concern because land holders managed to have uhfs in there or that 's where land cruisers or whatever the driver also drive on their properties and um it was the best means of being able to contact the rfs and we 've obviously had the issue about uh uh barrigan the ryan repeater uhf tower there um and the idea that forests is advisor graduated between plantings and roads i 'm not sure if um if private planters the private forestry will also follow that lead with the borg and others will follow the lead i 'm not certain they may do so uh i commend the motion i think um thank you to council mccarthy for providing some of these uh fire trials and particularly the boundary roads and uh it 's private fine i don 't know whether there 's any rules or regulations right there 's just the building arrays right next to the fence and there 's in some of this soil erosion jumping you know there 's gutters this deep and the fence is right there and there 's bitty bush all along their fence and there 's nothing in the private land owner i i don 't know who stipulates how far the roads have to be from the fence and then they say it 's a good idea to have the pines further away from the road it gives you room to do some draining to put pipes in but i don 't know all this new land they 're buying whether there 's some rules or regulations it could be applied to it because there 's no room to move there 's no room to repair the roads and they 're washed roads of the street just to comment anyhow thank you media reports page 15 item 1201 cta audit risk information councillor kellum thank you a second to please councilman kevin mr kelm thank you madam mayor um this is a report for information uh i 'll note that um the issues raised in the in the comments section um were all dealt with quite adequately by the the uh joint eric we have with um and these issues noted were well dealt with by people with financial staff here and as noted in the presentation before the meeting problems began we have unqualified involved which is pleased i will note also that the issue we had last year with for uh embedded chief audit officer and staff within each council appears to have been moderated substantially and that our current arrangements with lisco will probably and i say probably fit the new local government uh requirements and we will probably probably be able to have a shared cheap audit officer which i think is a common issue we can deal with um can i commend the reports thank you councilman thank you madame um look i think the report and the uh the attachments so to speak to themselves 1202 local emergency management committee i recommend these the recommendation is that the minutes of the local emergency management committee meeting held on the 9th of november 2020 i received his information and i have someone to move that way please counselor given thank you a second to please counselor cable house forgiveness do you wish to speak to the motion um happy with uh the information there thank you well thank you councilman thank you madam mayor it 's a report for information and the information is always thank you any other comments counsellors um i 'll probably be down there next weekend but i 'm just wondering has the hampton roads slip now being rectified or where is it in the work progress um no it hasn 't been the last few times i 've been um [Music] and i believe it 's not going to be a quick process it 's nearly been the other comments counsellors put the recommendation in favor page 29 1203 traffic traffic advisory local committee the recommendation is there that the minutes of the traffic advisory local committee meeting on the 12th a move on please council thank you a second to please yes a lot of information there um yes i yeah recommend the the um received his information thank you councilman kevin um thank you madam mayor yes the um units attached to this report to provide information heritage committee meeting page 33 item 1204 there 's a recommendation there in four parts counselors i 'd like to propose an alternate recommendation i 'd like to propose a change to item four and i would like you to read that council notes to study done by mr stewart if i can get a set number for that alternate recommendation council [Music] so the council notes the study they don 't want on what it 's in relation to because it currently says on open space yes i 'm happy for that to join you yeah yep yep thank you okay comments on this one comes with us yeah i moved it you secondly yeah okay all right do you speak along this meeting was pretty straightforward in a way until we hit the environmental issues and i think i 'll don 't want to be told where i plant and how i plant trees by some people that i don 't think are appropriate um anyway i probably should have stepped aside on the council danny took over um but um i didn 't um one of the things that came out of that was um taking a treat from much beyond the royal hotel the tourist hotel um i 've done some follow-up and i i only got information from one person but on this stand that the truth split into five and was taken away for safety reasons those ladies could have done the same thing they could have checked into what was taken away uh another thing why i don 't support anything like this and this is only my personal thing and the thing is the average high school when the high school was built this tree said was significant with um the landing of the plane king from smith next thing you know we got a request that they wanted to cut the trees down because they fall on the kids heads and the other ornamental pine there turned out to be a bloody nuisance we had most things built and it crossed the fortune that carted away because it was just a nuisance thing so i think there 's a lot of common sense in in the town there 's truth highlighted that over here behind on that bank that what can you do if if the landowner decides to cut them down you can 't_''_6408.719 do much of it most 99 of people want these trees the walnut tree is gone but it had to go it was a safety issue so i don 't support their um wanting to have a tree preservation order and the other one was the forestry park is out there on the abercrombie road for them maybe new year will be seeking funding for it if we can to put a park up there soon as there may be a stainless steel park and then we let the forestry do the stones around it but i think council should put the park up first and um oh the other one was a mainstream photograph mr rawson has it shows um i think there 's three of them the buildings in the main street in 1902 we 're just wondering whether we can 't put them down take some photographs of it and put them down for cook park on the morning down there we 're going to get some funding or there 's some moose money in the office or something but yeah surely goodness we can do something when people come to town they could see what the town used to be and then this is coming back through the heritage committee at some point well that 's what we yeah because it 's not in the recommendation yeah oh okay so would that come back through well i thought we 're trying to recommend it in that part but anyway second last part but um all right i 'll just maybe later on seek council 's permission on we 'll do it ourselves we 'll pay for it just recommendation two couple of quite a quite a few questions um this is asking that we have the staff have preliminary discussions with department of planning urban conservation area in part a of schedule 5 of the oberon local environmental plan what it is currently listed as an area of significance heritage significance so what 's if it goes into part a schedule five what are the implications through the chair that 's what the conversation with dpi will outline but my my understanding is is that they 're looking to make it an item in its own right so have that precinct protected as a heritage item so that which could preclude certain things occurring so i 'm assuming that recommendation 2 is both it is only obtaining advice from dpi on this and no further action is taken until it would come back to council yes and i believe it 's for development into the new lep i think it 's if they i gather from conversation that it 's it 's working towards inclusion the new lep not so much changing the status now right because i think before we made this council consented to it going into part a of schedule five we would certainly want to know the full implications of does state that under preliminary discussions i 'm happy if it 's preliminary discussions at the bottom of page 33 i 'm assuming the shi form which is referenced a number of times is a state heritage um form of some inventory state heritage inventory form and that 's referring to the matters at the top of page 35 and the recommendation there which that these are purely to be put on the state basically in the archives that state to be included within inventory to the o 'connell urban conservation area i like council mccarthy read the report page 39 and the following um and a lot of questions in relation to this including considerable increase costs for council if we have to look after all these areas on waterways for weeds and everything else and also by precluding land holders from accessing stock water from some of these streams and other things um in particular comments on page 40 [Music] and the you know allotments to fish river etc um because i 'm assuming a lot of these people have purchased or have properties on these waterways in thing concerns me is in relation to walkways and well a number of things but the other thing on page 44 which is page six of that report um was the cycle ways we 've just gone and put quite an expense put a walkway under the corridor of oaks and if i 'm reading the bottom of this correctly it 's now saying we should have put a cycle away as well i i realize this is a written and a lot of it 's very interesting and very good but i certainly think it needs a large critique over it uh by council before any um any actions are taken in relation to it um well that council is to note this no did i understand that yes and i understand the reason for noting um and certainly would increase council 's costs considerably thank you madam man thank you councillor cable [Music] in support of mr um stewart in some incidents and it was clarified by our heritage advisor some of these walkways and these items where it runs down a stream were taken up in the a good idea which is fair enough but where you 've got to actually fight back and resume it or whatever you create all that problems and the use of it maintenance becomes a problem and and ewan 's words were that 's too relevant it 's it 's sufficient it 's a vision thank you very much don 't take it away from me but yeah thank you any other comments on this one counselors put the recommendation there in four parts [Music] thank you age 52. 1301 local roads and community infrastructure program extension funding allocation phase two there is a recommendation there councillors that i 'm going to put to get the conversation going but be aware there will need to be an amendment when it 's decided what um projects we 're going to support so do i have a mover for the recommendation that sits there councilman mcgivern is thank there now i think you may have all had an opportunity to look at the opportunities and i think the easiest way to do this is we will go around the table each person can will come to a consensus i don 't think there 's any other way to do it yes come from sorry man i think uh before we get to that stage there are some questions when we come to you maybe you can put the question well i think the questions might be relevant what are the questions thank you madam um a couple of comments on page 42 that paragraph should refer to phase one not phase two yeah we 've noted that um and just to note on 53 yeah for everyone to note that hazel grove road and ginkin road have been completed that 's why in the addendum provided to us by the general manager and in the recommendations um on the road program we 're going talking about beaconsville and carl road um if i could on them under option two under community infrastructure projects page 54 half to two-thirds of the way down the page i note with several of these they are also included within grant opportunities under 140 1406. um we 've included specifically in there the over you know fitness center think um can 't recall for the new amenities over on tour also included there i think certainly the last two bullet points there were so just for jen i in order to be able to to sort of make a decision we sort of need if we 're putting grant applications in for those is there any do we have any view from staff as to what the likelihood of success of those applications would be because it could flavor our view on how we prioritize those things that will be subject to grant opportunities and are referenced later under the grants area of this of this report i sympathize with that question and i 'll go to the general agenda so through the chair the reason why those three projects have been put in is because they sit high and on your priority list of your community infrastructure wants if council were not to support these as part of this money which is not a grant it is money that 's being allocated to council we will continue to support a grant application for these projects because they so it 's a matter of we 've supplied these projects on the basis that they are currently on their infrastructure matrix and if they aren 't supported through the allocation of funds we will seek grant funding for these projects in terms of can i give an undertaking on whether we 're going to get them or not i can 't_''_7111.119 do that but we sometimes have a view as to you know um we 've got no chance we 've got a reasonable chance we 've got a good chance i think and i know that 's hard to say i think that 's quite unfair to put that to the general manager in a public forum um counsellor well it does does flavor you you have seen the grant process i have seen a great process to form an opinion and and what i will say through the chair is that the way we position grants is purely based on the information that 's provided in the grant funding requirements criteria and we push those projects to where we believe we 've got good opportunities to secure is there any other clarification before we go around the tape that 's required councillor kellum do you have any preferences here or comments the part that we received as a lake submission which is of course newton 's hill road um and some of the other islands there in terms of roads i would ask the chair the technical services director how much money are we currently spending on that new and silver road section of yours speaking of sorry that the council products for being another seal um the frequency of grading uh the entirety of the road would be probably on a basis of four times a year at this point that has been occurring also really depending on summer storm activities is really the primary causation of a lot of that damage but total sums of money in terms of expenditure to do a road or a road grade significantly reduce i suppose the intensive labour on those particular areas heavily eroded which is the focus of that particular offering that council for consideration so the 12.2 kilometers which is down from duck and white road correct that 's the estimated and twelve thousand dollars correct that 's correct um my i 'm thinking from my perspective on until road is there 's a potential matrix it is an important uh three-way for a bunch of people and i know that section of road is diabolical the other issue i have is i think the new amenities at the overwhelming pool we reallocated that money earlier sorry late last year and i think we should satisfy that particular promise we made i think the recreation room needs doing it and the extension on the um indoor fitness centre thank you yeah and the amenities at the pool option one not not the recreation room but the new amenities thank you cousin kathy yeah i 'm the same as meet the newness or road and the amenities but i i 'm a bit concerned about the costing of the lunar new road but i suppose it 's not the right time you can nearly do that in cement for that cost thank you councilman thank you councillor thank you madam mayor uh i 'm i 'm uh however i have had a fair bit of feedback from people who do use it and who are familiar with it and so yeah i i believe that um we really have to do something about that so that 's that 's on the priority list and uh like counselor come on the the amenities of the pool we took the money uh away from that to spend on the on the on the main on the gym building so yeah i think that 's a priority for us um thank you madam mayor i would agree with nunentle road but i would probably go for the oberon indoor fitness center completion of the vac semi enclosed area basically because i believe the fitness centre is used year round and that really needs to be completed for exercise classes etc thank you for giving it looks as if i 'll have to go a bit more detail on this one number one for me would be the the community all the black springs they urgently require the installation of acoustic panels to make the hall uh worthwhile to hold social here if i can just show it to you as it 's been around for a while and uh i just think there 's a big expanse of country we have over on up here and we have black springs here now this is to do with covert and a lot of other areas you 'll see that 80 percent of our council area is in this southern area and i just think that the black springs hall if it 's made fit for purpose can be a great advantage for social events and also meetings and i know they had business campaigns for black springs and over here at the show ground and exercises i 'm not just too sure but the way things are there 's a lot of a lot of you know two and a half thousand people living over and two and half thousand live out in the bush i just think we 've got to be considering uh other areas of spending and allocating this money it 's not a big cost we have got it there running you know those grants may never uh there 's going to be more need to look after our elderly people uh i hope it 's here it 's a new way of life things could get worse it 's just a meeting place it 's simple to the whole area it 's not a big lot of money to ask but as the hall is now we 're getting we 've got a new kitchen in it new toilets going out uh local association you know bitching the road out the front happy to put money towards the cost of the toilets there 's a bit of a blowout i really think that we 've got to be thinking of the country people there in the south big area and uh we can link in with barrigan on different things but again the swimming pool six months a year if the money 's there i 'd rather support the fitness center and maybe the roads if the dollars are there i don 't know how the dollars can work out there but so i i just feel that this would complete uh the halls so that can use they could have meetings they could have different various functions there but we 've got to keep an eye on our older people and we have some plans there we have some plans to have some sunday evening socials and play some music or bingo or something just to make sure the well-being of the people say that so kerry your first ones is the black springs hall second one is the fitness center and the third one is you said the road yeah well i 'll go although i don 't usually advocate uh deviating from our matrix i do think that newton 's hill road is in an atrocious state does need some money spent on it um i 'm going for the amenities of the pool i do realize that the fitness center does need um some funding but i do personally think that the funding stream that 's being applied for through the grant which is fought it will stand a very good chance of getting up so that 's that 's why i 'm taking unison road later if it 's consensus by thousands of the swimming pool doesn 't that give us forty thousand that day that could be um i don 't know i 'll have to get there so we might have to give preference then to the black springs that could be an option yeah it would be an option to the council so through the chair council mccarthy sort of stole a little bit of thunder every council every count you can still thunder all your like counsellor um until so with that in mind if you 're going to allocate three hundred and twelve thousand dollars for the new zealand and we will bring back a an appropriate costing for councillors and the next available meeting to make sure that if it does need that requirement or if there 's further that council want to look at we will provide that tune into a road as priority one that will leave 220 000 left in the key the next one is the pool amenities so we have the pool amenities okay sorry 489.2 492. 192. so that leaves him so let 's say no no it 's councillors have then prioritised the pool amenities as a project that they want to see it 's not unanimous but is it is is consensus there at 177 that 's right so 220 it 's 489 mccarthy 's using 490. but it does say 180 000 for the minister 's school then the note is that council will recall 177 for this project was awarded but 180 is what 's been designated to go towards that project that 's how i read that so there is approximately 40 000 left that you may want to consider i 'm in your hands can i ask if councillor gibbons has any idea of i mean i know that that project is fifty thousand dollars uh forty two i think that one forward four fifty one oh two uh that 's not certain the the green application [Music] [Music] um noting that the costing for the units hill road is a rough order of magnitude at the moment uh i think if we wait till we get a decent costing back we 've got forty thousand dollars to leeway there uh and once revisit if we need to allocate an amount of money to some other project and that that allows us to do the priority one and if there 's suitable money i would be happy to support um council givens proposal but perhaps at the next council meeting can i suggest councillor givens that we have a letter from the association um committing some financial not a figure but some financial support towards the project that way when it does come back we don 't have to go away again we can decide through the chair just to give them just a support to that cancel those proposals the requirements of the deed is that all projects need to be submitted by june 30. however and the kicker is is that all projects need to be completed by december 30. so the reason why we want to go early is we also know that we put these applications or we certainly put our priorities in and it takes a number of weeks before we get a sign off from the deputy prime minister or whatever signs the fund indeed to say early however in this instance i don 't think that it 'd be that it would be a good it 's not a bad idea to go down this path to give chris a a better idea of scoping and costing that new until road project that 's my capital yes while we 're throwing in wild card options discount council gives his suggestion for the blacksmith 's hall but um is it possible that we could other councils could write some other projects for consideration at the next meeting if there 's a um for the short form for the shortfall i can 't see why that couldn 't be as normal i 'd like to suggest the wood parts in scotia avenue will exist at once been repaired or replaced because that is absolutely direct like this that people have to walk down the street down underground on slopes wet grass banks many elderly people that go walking there every day for their health quite dangerous and it 's one of the major residential streets in town and no footpaths and i suggest councilman um mckay that you that it can be considered as part of your ongoing report for sure okay thank you i support council thing about the footpath up there but if you 're looking at putting the fuel up there it needs to be wider than their standard footpaths in other words if you 're going to have your spawn complex up there you need to have a little place like man jeremy they have a footpath and it 's great like you can write it the mother can be there pushing the pram along the little kid can be there with his pushback what we 're filming at the moment just and the danger on that 's up fast but if councilman is pursuing this we need to look at a wider footpath as well right this can be discussed yes i know we 've got to start thinking now thank you thank you i mean it from me to suggest that we might spend money somewhere else other than black springs another possibility it might be if there is some money left over to to add it on to a few more think that would perhaps be a better use of the money use it for the things that we are trying to fix on the bottom page on 54 it says that we can provide alternative direction to staff as the priorities of this fund and then we went around the table so we 're trying to fix the problem with the hall so that 's where i sit okay counsellors sharon has been um putting the recommendation together the amendment together if you 'd like to read that are we able to split nominations to the program i don 't think we are if there 's a report coming back um yeah so you can you can you can provide where you 're going to spend your money at any point in time and then we just need to reapply that one time so you think that it 's a bit nice nominations if we want to reapply we have to ask for a correction okay so i can see your hands up counselors i 'm just trying to get my head around this sorry some more oh it 's it not hold it up further to put in a deviation from the like to to submit an application based on that and then have to put in an application to download is that you can split the fund right however it 's like anything it 's better to utilize the whole funding package and then apply for that same point of time if the director is going to bring back an assessment as to what that is i would probably go down the path of deferring the application until march so why doesn 't three become two and two becomes three no problem with that um and through the chair if councillors have other projects that they would like to see utilized in this fashion please provide it to us but at this point in time we are under the undertaking that from option one the two major priorities have been met have been dealt with this is just the residual of the fault council um just to clarify in my mind anyway the technical service director is going to come back with a with a much more detailed recollection is that was a pretty firm costing there was so we were comfortable with that at this point we 're comfortable with that all right so just a matter of what figure comes back from the technical services director as to how much we will have or not okay counsellors i now need someone to move that amendment please counselor kevin and councillor capable [Music] do we need a further point in there to say that at the march meeting any any delta in funds between the 531 9114 and the detailed costings will be then allocated or can be allocated to a further project we just don 't we seem to have left that in abundance i can 't i can 't propose that amendment because i propose the motion but i 'm just speaking someone else would have to push it two a further report outlined detailed costings of the nominated projects and alternate projects to utilizing reigning funding allocation i didn 't read it says i 'm going to put this amendment all in favor carried unanimously the amendment now becomes the recommendation of the motion 59 1302 development application 102021.4.1 new shed and demolition of existing sheds the recommendation is that council vary part c.55 building height plane and part c.6.4 carports and garages of its current dcp 2001 associated to development application 10.20.2021.4.1 the construction was shed and demolition of existing sheds at lot 19 in dp2364 section a being known as 25 scotia avenue oberon that a division be called in accordance with section 375a of the local government action 1993 a mover please councilwoman kevin thank you and the second council thank you thank you madam mayor um i 'd support the recommendation from two parts as written i 've just asked the um i spoke to the director of planning um noting that the neighbor notification closed today have there been any submissions from neighbours thank you so there 's been no objections for neighbours um that america seems reasonable to me it seems that there 's a consolidation of two sheds in the one china to the back of a the back of a block um looks absolutely reasonable to me and i 'd support the recommendations thank you councilwoman mayor of support thank you college councillors councilman um i don 't need to be anything from the neighbours because i 'm glad of the clutter that 's coming off the street it 's it is cluttered okay thank you any other comments counselors i 'll put the recommendational link over marriage unanimously thank you 1303 page 65 corporate credit corporate credit card policy 2017 review the recommendation is that council endorsed revised corporate credit card policy 2017 as reported can i have a mover councilman kevin thank you understand that thank you thank you thank you madam mayor and i thank the corporate services director for a markup which obviously makes these documents a lot easier i know it 's the major change is just a changing nomenclature for the corporate services director and that 's the major major change to it um and the reference to the end of the external auditors ordering it annually so i 'd fully support the recommendation as it stands thank you thank you the housekeeping process and credit cards are well matched thank you any other comments on this one council put monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have a mover please i 'll send the keyboard any second to please that 's okay thank you um a detailed report um if i could just reference a couple of areas um the bottom of page 72 um the sentence says council received no submissions as result of the required consultation of the management agreement i wasn 't aware that the management agreement went on public exhibition did it um so through the chair the management agreement didn 't go on exhibition but council did have to exhibit the fact that it was ending android into an agreement with the y right if the if the if there was a submission received the process was much longer in terms of finalizing them okay okay well um maybe i should suggest that wording might need to be changed a little in future um the issue on the bottom of page 73 um i just i noticed that a refresher on traffic control the swim safety work management system was held for staff does controls that may have had some impact or contributed to this accident i 'm happy to defer to the tech services director in this instance but my understanding is no that wasn 't the case but council needed to be look at its training processes around the screen but i 'm having to defer them yeah through this year certainly looking at angles of how the traffic control management setup was one of the you know certainly criteria of looking into why the causation of the accident occurred but no fault of signage and and in terms of how the traffic control management plan will set out or convey for the for the motorists and such but i think it 's just purely uh it 's just an incident that has occurred with uh with incident certainly that yeah that person probably wasn 't paying attention as much as they should have been okay thank you and it 's not uncommon that when an incident occurs because it 's involved with the website we have to go through a process um three quarters of the way down page 77 um facility um we got any update as to where we are with that the da has it may be under the listing of uh updates i think but anything further from that meeting um the the meeting that was held that day was to push the finalization of the da and the requirements associated with developing that document that we met lodging we are running that 's it okay thank you that 's good all right that 's all um and a mayor oh yeah i i wish for a recommendation in this report thank you thank you madam uh just a couple of things from the um tourism and economic development activities i attended the annual general meeting of the business and tourism association last week as did the general manager and i will make a report for from that meeting for our next meeting but just in discussion with people there and i see about the summer holiday visitation oberon has been busy all through the period um and just speaking to some of the retailers there the other night the the retail retail activity is um still really happened dare i say benefited um during this the covet period and i don 't think there would be very many businesses in town who would uh say that they have not benefited during that time um there are a number of um of other activities coming up that people we need to be aware of and start talking about the field to forest and um there 's other things that are mentioned there on the the banners have gone down well in the community as well but the um yeah the market trail banners have been a great success um yeah that 's all um on the 3rd of february you 've got inspections of the [Music] independent living which open route again or it all barricaded off steam and when does the carports go up i think informed council the an interim occupation certificate will be issued for the units to allow people to move in there in the very near future carports are still progressing with the new director so you 're going to give us the date when people are going to move in yeah them available when the interim was issued okay and the other question is when is completed now did we get the compensation from the builder to when it was supposed to be completed back in november through the chair those discussions now take place in accordance with the contract okay thank you thank you answer any other comments with the recommendation 1402 monthly activity report planning and development recommendation is a report of item 1402 is received as information a mover and a second to please an informative report if i could just um ask in relation to 179 pages of nine surround your indoor fitness center um i 'm surprised that an occupational certificate was issued so late in the piece when obviously the facility 's been occupied for some time um right through the chair right against that it 's just a simple process whereby interim allows you to occupy it yeah okay that was the only thing i i look forward to seeing the um indoor living units um finalization report at the march meeting because we have been looking forward to it for some time and should look at the gas issue and see if we have such a problem in future how we can solve it better because that 's often not in a more expedited form i realized there are a number of difficulties and we had to approach the local member to finalize it that you know we can 't delays and this sort cost us cost accounts and money because we 're not getting rent from these facilities i think it 's been forever like council mccarthy before so if your lesson were through the chair potentially in addition to that report maybe a life cycle cost yes analysis to save counsellor needing to put another option against the information report but um well i 'm more than more than happy to to provide a bit of an indicative costing movement i 'm happy that this this project proceeded before we had these discussions on through my support so i was looking prospectively rather than retrospectively in that regard obviously we talked about finalization reports particularly the through life support was really prospecting rather than retrospective thank you councilman thank you nothing recommendation on it page 85 1403 monthly activity report technical services recommendation the report item is received as information council givens thank you a second upcoming just a couple of things to ask the engineer so that clayton 's pit gravel has been won and crushed that would be for use on the furry end road of the the starting up now is that right chris the use of reshaping from clayton spit out on the burrito end of the river road where they 've started or through the chair there 's been two sources of travel uh often pushed up in in pitch one being the parachute corporation which was uh purposely the pit that we targeted given the incline contributions on behalf of forestry corporation for this particular fixing local roads project uh the the testing results it 's an end all we can use gravel from either pip they 're both being tested in terms of the ucs and uh for the actual additional stabilization product so at this stage we 're going to be using the boomerang pip this there is a surplus of gravel for so that 's why initial gravel exists i just felt that it was a fair bit closer to the barrier in the clayton spit i wasn 't too sure whether we were going to use that out on the other end or not don 't suppose i we had the natural disaster snow event down on page 85 halfway down but that 's been a good pickup to repair that uh abercrombie road between here and over uh and black springs it looks as if it 's coming doing a good job what they 've done there and the only other thing down on page 86 the favorites program so is that 19 kilometers of that 's correct um this is part of a 1.95 million dollar project in which we got 1.65 million dollars to spend this financial year and it 's including uh improvements or safety improvements to um sections of the road guard rail and uh also the the bitumen re-shooting of 19 or 20 kilometers off of the actual road payment so that is a quite a substantial project in terms of the funding allocated where target at all to go on the one sheet is it so the previews the project area is uh approximately round porter 's retreat through uh close to palin yards over over a 20 kilometer area all right very good thanks for that um on page 85 the roadside vegetation works greatly appreciated on the remaining section of mount david road thinking of services director um i know the continuing problem raised on 86 with the blockage of um borrowing damn toilets and i know there 's been a meeting at the dam which is referenced from the mayor of general manager 's report but we have to look at how that 's how that 's looked at into the future the i know that there 's been a lot of work done on abercrombie road um as i ran late for the working party on the stp because i think i had six to seven stop go signs on the way in campbell 's river road and then police five or six hundred at the probably road so there 's certainly a lot of work being undertaken i commend was going to ask a question but i think we need some clarification and and if counselor line you might correct me if i 'm wrong um i think if we look at the particular other meetings technical services activity and other meetings was the meeting of the second december wasn 't that the full over on street um beautification committee because i don 't recall only having one meeting with spak for moss and michaels not two is that right and we did have another we had one with i thought the second one was the 11th of december when we had had the meeting with spacman mossaved michaels and the first meeting i thought was the total group yeah i think you are correct there it shouldn 't have end consultants exactly so i think it was all of them all of the committee for that one yeah so on the second and the twelfth it was a discussion about the street tree master plan uh in terms of what that may look like on uh you know yeah and that was with everyone i think uh yes think council line i would dedicated to talk to the consultants who did the orange one which was bachmann los michaels and if i could just ask um have we got any i think we asked a couple of actions from those consultants have they come back to us with costings or any details or what 's the reason out of that uh yeah through the chair there was an email with the minutes from those particular meetings which i did distribute with regard to spatman michael 's response which was very indicative at the time which is out for review and comment which that emails actually requested no no i 'm sorry i 've missed it it 's my my fault i 'll um have a review of that i apologize i 've missed it thank you particular services director the other comments oh i think the council line 's number uh name spelled incorrectly in the 11th or december 2020 meeting as well um just a clarification humphrey 's lane road inspection is it finished and completed at the standard door uh through the year the purpose of undertaken early january which i believe it has my return to office this week i will be intending to have a look at that tomorrow or the next day just to ensure that is all in order i have been advised by the planning department that works are now complete so i 'm just making sure from that inspection this week that it is to a satisfactory standard okay and then the subdivision can be released that 's correct okay thank you thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors recommendation all in favor generally thank you page 88 1404 monthly activity report corporate services the recommendation is that the report item for 14.04 to receive this information can i have a mover please help me give her another second advice um thank you madam mayor um detailed report um and it 's great to see all the activities that have been done and to have some photographs of them if it actually shows it makes more sense than just having having a written report um if i could ask if there 's any any update on the the top off um through the may i the committee is still organizing visits to councils uh we 're hoping to finalize that by early march finalize the visits or finalise the decision well both we 're hoping to finalize the visits by early march and the decision by the end of march march okay um i was very interested to read the uh next section on the iot sensors because i 'm aware these can be used a lot of things which may assist council in being able to monitor a lot of areas and also the use of the cameras as well and it 's pleasing to see that the cameras of the reef reserve are giving us so much information will we have a plan or a project in future as to where it 's recommended that we extend these sensors for use by council once we 've had this the trial um through the mayor yes the plan is to develop a plan once the trial is completed which will involve considering costs as well thank you and costing as well um [Music] the only other up in the report that was raised in the auditor 's comments was in relation to debt recovery um and what um what actions are being taken with the current debt recovery agency or our internal debt recovery procedures to try and reduce the bad debts which i think are about 10 percent down to what is at least industry sorry on industry standard council standard of seven to eight percent or better um i realize that um it may be an opportunity to ask that at the moment but if you could maybe provide a report at the next council meeting please through through the mayor i 'm happy to i will provide some information in my next monthly report but i can advise that uh both staff and our external debt recovery agency have um picked up the pace with regards to debt recovery and i 'll bring back the report with some information um thank you madam mayor um note that in the minutes that we will be getting a report on that next meeting yes that 's correct thanks thank you madame i um i moved value of general forgot to tell us about the charge which was which was an interesting move um and it 's also interesting to see that that the um you know good many residents who have appealed their valuation have been successful in that something that i was going to ask the director perhaps was that in the press over the last last week of the week before there were general news items about uh revaluations or the value of generals valuations of various councils across um well the central tablelands central west it said that valuations in oberon had decreased significantly um there 's quite a few rural land holders who would be a bit startled to hear that because somebody 's can we get a bit of an idea where those decreases were um through the the i heard that as well with hannah had a bit of a chuckle um because um real estate prices definitely haven 't gone down but the revaluation prices that they may be uh talking about are the revaluation of where people have put in appeals and the um the um the reconsidered their rates their increase and reduced it there so i don 't think it 's an overall revaluation of the area has gone down i think if they 're referring to the actual re reconsideration of rates of values that were put out thank you councilman um now me just from that point that i read that article and it made a headline about a large drop in values which is a very very very small proportion of properties and most marine was basically centered in town certainly as council government pointed out there 's another rule [Music] if i could respond through madame e the um i think it 's worth noting that a lot of the properties that were reconsidered by the valuer general were actually larger properties rural properties and that may actually come back to affect us in our total income at the end of this financial year thank you any other questions council mccarthy yes just the feedback on the hub and one of the concerns there is the toilet for the staff that looks like it 's the common toilet there but we the staff have their own private facilities um my understanding that some industries it 's a requirement but um yeah look i honestly think we 've got to look at it now and um with covered and things like that we 've got to have amenities that control you know not just public amenities but i think somewhere along the line we need to look at it we 're not taking anything away from the thing but maybe one of them rooms can be allocated to it or store room or something like that but we 've got to some reception so these the uh hub submissions um have gone boarded to sorry to the director i have been forwarded to the uh to copy and architect i have something to be they have been forwarded to coffee but uh their assignment is finished their with these um submissions will be considered as part of the next phase when we appoint the um architect to finalize the um design thank you councilman kevin sorry madame if i could again i was just going to clarify that on page 95 i to stage two we will consider the original plans that 's council council here we 'll consider the original plans plus these submissions uh before it goes to the architects or with the architects how what 's the time what 's the um how how 's the staging affected and how when do we because obviously we as councils need to look at also the submissions and to consider those in light of the original plan so i said divisions this will come back to council i 'm just not quite certain of the stages um through the mayor the program for this is that the next phase is the completion of the design and through that phase there will be opportunity for uh community and counsellors to have further input into that so into the design plan so is that before it goes to the architects or what can you hear the part of the briefing um it will through the mayor will be part of the brief counseling given and the architects will consider that as part of their brief as their scope part of their scope okay just want to ensure that some of these things are looked at and considered before we brief the architects and they come back with something and we said well not though as a result of the community consultation we think certain you know there may be certain changes before we don 't want to be paying them fees to do something that we don 't think is quite quite what we want now after community consultations what i 'm saying i mean i think so this has been some good input from the submissions that we need to take into account is what i 'm saying that 's great yeah and i don 't we don 't want to be paying architects to go off on a without council saying well we think that 's important issue maybe that 's not so important we think that 's a good issue etc so that we can actually properly brief the architects in advance because the last thing we want is them to be doing nugetry work we want to be keeping our design contingency amount to a minimum as my view back the time frame slightly to provide a the council is an opportunity to have that input um i think when are you intending to go to go out go to the architects with stage two if i could ask what date um we 're through the mayor we 're hoping to finalize the expression of interest for the project management over the next week or ten days um the aim is to go out to tender in march um could i suggest that it 's been proposed that there 'd be an extraordinary general mating relation to an issue on the stp that it might be an appropriate time to also bring this up at the stp if i could ask you through the met through you madam mayor to the general manager if that would be appropriate and and to the director corporate services i just think we need to ensure we have a proper brief and these the the considerations be looked at so the stp extraordinary meeting is not yet scheduled um i 'm not aware of that special meeting but i 'm happy to provide has been provided it 's just a matter of whether councillors think that they 're a good idea or not to include in that brief so um if it 's a debrief on the submissions certainly that 's something that we could consider so that stp meeting will need to be a whole council meeting is it yes it does have to be through the chair and extraordinary meetings okay and all i would suggest is we have a list of a list of what 's been suggested and then we look at each of those and say yes we think that is a good idea and needs to be incorporated in the design brief no yes no and that shouldn 't be too difficult because out of the seven submissions um a lot of the information was just um querying the site and querying the funding which is already settled that 's right so it 's it 's to be just looking at there was some re-emphasis on it put into the building yeah re-emphasis on areas and a few other things i can 't see anything and i and what we have is the original need to look at it and say yes we agree with the commission or we 're done through the chair to make this quite streamlined as part of that report you have all the submissions yes we do i suggest that through this process that the director brings back a summary of those submissions as to what 's been suggested and council can then look at it and say in out not required in out not required a huge analysis i mean it 's something that would help or assist the not only the project manager but the director in formulating the brief you 'll spot on mr general okay thank you for that the other comments council 's on this i just can 't understand you going to the project manager next and then to the website out to the people and to go into the architect somewhere so through the chair we have to put a design together so we have to in fact seek expressions for architects to do that okay and then the project manager will have oversight of a brief for the architect and this is where the conversation has gone to okay that 's fine hey councils i 'm going to put the recommendation later thank you page item 1405 statement of investments recommendation is there that the council received the report item 1405 's information i 'm going to have a movement plus and effectively thank you a second to place [Music] 1406 brandt 's monthly update the recommendation is there that report item 1406 has received this information council capable come from kevin thank you that 's the people likewise straightforward uh information um just if i could page 128 c fixing local road which is c which is about a third of the way down um your accident and burger road restoration so forestry corporation is only contributing 49 536 which then means the council 's contributing there 's no actual co-contribution from council is that correct through the chair that 's my understanding yes we 're going after the law right and the co-contribution we 're saying is from the forestry they won 't up their contribution no contribution by way of gravel should we be noting the um was it the crif um grant which was actually unsuccessful which was the brack springs acoustic panels i didn 't see that on the table but maybe that 's yes it is mentioned in the table not much in the table so it 's not meant for the table but normally we mention unsuccessful ones yeah i see them in the table um 129 halfway down halfway down i 'm talk i 'm assuming um under the building better regions fund um for the stp which is the federal government grant opportunity um which closes on the 5th of march and it 's one of the reasons what an extraordinary general media 's extraordinary council meeting for the stp the cba refers to cost-benefit analysis in the second paragraph and so the with for the sports complex we 're applying under the bushfire local economic recovery fund at the top of page 128 and we 're also applying it to the building better regions fund infrastructure team round five is that correct if i got it right under the chair that is correct for correct okay um i 'm also i 'm in the next one building better regions fund infrastructure sorry infrastructure scheme round five other projects um i wondered whether the black springs if the black springs acoustic panels cannot be accommodated elsewhere whether it could also be applied for under this ground that 's the first part the second is was on page 130 the third bullet point i don 't think the o 'connell recreation ground development cost of two to three hundred thousand comes with an internal improvement fund unless i 'm wrong it should it should not fall on it should not say funded by the town improvement fund or parks it 's not part funded by the tif so i think that 's incorrect um through the chair apologies if that 's it says that the top council applicant staff are preparing applications for projects already funded by the town part funded by the town improvement fund including the first two are right the third one o 'connell recreation ground development cost is not correct it 's not funded by the teachers what it should be separate separate one and my question is as i said another separate line if um if we don 't have sufficient funds from the i get confused with all these grants the amount of 531 000 to put into the black springs acoustic panels it could be included again through the chair we look at all the opportunities to look at those projects and they are there to be able to be utilized as required there the intention of this report is to try and give an indication of council that there is still lots of opportunities out there the saucepan it would be also possible that though we have already agreed under 3a and page 130 that the amenities for the pool um be actually funded from that amount that we have been granted but we could have put the amenities for the pool into this fund as well could we not as it was part of the sporting through the chair we could have done a lot of things which is why the one need to be ready in conjunction with 1406. i note that we were unsuccessful with general manager indicated that there may be an opportunity for further grant opportunities for that coming forward is there or do you know if there is a ground opportunity coming forward that could be included through um i know the branch office there is looking at another shining strength of that correct okay but maybe it 's not to the point where it 's been submitted yet or formulated there is no there hasn 't been an opportunity for that to be disputed at this point in time right that 's all from me thank you paper any other comments putting your recommendation all in favor thank you page 131 1407. water and sewer plant report the recommendation is that report item 1407 is received information and i 'll just note that with the dam levels under january 2021 the bottom line should read 32.1 not 2.1 can i have somebody to move them no thank you because i 'm giving a counselor thank you um thank you madame thank you for that um that amendment otherwise we would be in a disastrous uh situation and coming in today because to view the dam i know that was more than 2.1 um bottom of page 132 second board um noting that um the main contractor whose name prominent is it or something who was doing work in queensland has now been able to divert their attention to this project the fluoride project do we have an updated timetable for completion and commissioning of this plant please uh through the update on the handover date or commissioning date as a test phase from prominent fluids is expected to be the 27th of this month february it still has a way to go with regard to then further check hold point checks with uh dpi and new south wales health so following the report from prominent will be then discussions with how we can do that with dpi and also the public requirement to advertise to the public in terms of council 's intent to introduce the right inception into the end of the water system so um it is a a lengthy process i will keep cancel the rest of those dates as they come to hand from dpi but it as students with cancer with science from state government is it appropriate to provide a new timeline please uh year through this year certainly uh i have some information that i 'm happy to share with council councillors in regard to the uh anticipated timeline as i know it at this stage at this point in time our end point is march if there is no action from the bureaucratic level as chris has indicated they 'll be pushed from other avenues to make those time frames so there 's only one other matter that needs to be addressed is with the actual uh training of our staff which is currently being undertaken so it just needs to be um that process takes its course and be signed off and certified as in terms of to um qualified um operators that can accidentally operate the radiation component of the water treatment but initial training can take clay place now and then once the commissioning you can obviously do the final training then so it can be done basically current initial training is in progress as we speak to the formalities quite a intensive course as you could understand and is taking its due course through uh qualified engineering water water engineers and taking yourself apart so what 's the scheduled date for completion of the training the training of these stages i understand hopefully will be complete by by march and that should sort of coincide with uh regard to the order inception early march that 's that 's the hope at this stage there has been some some issues with uh tafe restructure and their delivery program i think however that that is in the process of being resolved and that 's not just uh as a result of over and staff being trained it 's a statewide uh so it has been something that would be closely watching so in the timeline you 're proposing to circulate you 'll also include the training completion that 's great thank you i um i moved the report um the water and saw a plant report the acceptance they 're just the only sad part is that uh upstream from the fish river is not getting the rain we 've got status of council resolutions recommendation is that report item 14 now ladies receive this information can i have a mover please house with table and the second of these councils that 's the capital gift uh thank you madam mayor a very comprehensive report and it makes it a lot easier for us to uh uh keep up to date with the summary progress status column thank you for doing that for us and um i could just ask a few questions 135 the first roe on the dog rocks road this matter has been going on for so long why is the value of general suddenly said it cannot finalize the matter prior to 28th of february any reasons provided could i suggest that if this thing starts getting out of hand again in relation to time knowing the time it 's been going on um that maybe it 's a matter that needs raising with a local member um if i could um made 140 though that 's been dealt with the top row we talked about that a minute ago timeline next completion um page 142 in it 's pleasing to see we 've got gps iridium on the ground on the greater fleet what 's been budgeted and what is the timeline um for this um gps iridium to be expanded to the other vehicles in the fleet um at this stage it 's something that is taking us um schools for the budgetary process which then will be uh budget for uh consideration i don 't actually have any figures on me at this stage to be able to provide but certainly can provide that further information to council so has it i can 't recall whether it 's been allowed for our budget for this year or it 's look we 're looking at it next year for vehicles outside the greater fleet and what 's already been a heavy vehicle so just through the chair item three is the capital purchase of additional gps telemetry will be considered as part of the tournament okay fine that 's all other vehicles okay fine thank you sorry page 144. um look it 's just uh uh well i don 't know it 's additional wording 900 it 's to undertake the electrical zone design for undergrounding the electricity in oberon street from raleigh to dudley street there 's nothing that talks about underground path power there and i think it should reference that that 's what we 're actually doing sorry it 's a resolution of council that is uh but um just just there 's nothing about underground power in that um the mayor and myself met with members of the essential energy um and and to their benefit they recognize that they have been a bit um absent and they 've got a new mantra about trying to um work with councils to try and um deliver on a few things and i took that opportunity to raise quite a number of things with them about what concerns us about those processes and they 're quite receptive to those things so um it 's progressing and we 're advocating even in that space to provide to try and get underground power across the whole of the um residential area but there 's a lot of two complete things but it 's at least understand there 's an issue with putting in the resolution could i suggest that in the comment maybe it says electrical design for undergrounding the power currently in progress and that doesn 't change the resolution through the um and again you know if we 're talking about nikon before but if we 're talking about my recollection scotia revenue doesn 't include underground power the footpath is a good idea to look at underground power then if the central industry you 're going to come to the party with something but that 's probably too possible but these things have got to be considered what i indicated uh counsellor was that we 've made them aware of our issues i made no mention in fact nor did they [Music] essential energy where were they from they were actually based in port macquarie okay so we went to the top okay and a name i can provide that to you okay just that i want to write to someone actually [Music] it is um as you know there 's three polls put up there in crete street and the laid to know who paid for it i think one of the local inquired and they set us for a subdivision council doesn 't know about a subdivision so it 's very odd that essential energies pay that money out maybe it 's a mistake and those three poles could come down are putting the recommendation all in there very thank you 150 item 1409 property budget review statements october to december 2020 the recommendation please there that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please counselor kellum thank you councilman thank you madame for information i know that um operating performance actual and budgeted uh back into healthy territory after 2019 20. own source operating revenues again back into healthy the ratios are doing well um which indicates that our budgeting and forecasting is doing well um thank you madam mayor um yes detailed reporters took a few questions if i could on page 153 halfway down in the restricted cash and investment reserves oh actually it 's the internal restrictions um there 's an amount of 15 000 against the barrier village improvement 11 meaning that the amounts we allocate each year for these villages are not being spent i thought some of them have been spent i 'm just surprised they 're so long those amounts have been allocated they haven 't been used so that 's three news worth i 've asked the director is going to supply report because i was most interested in the barricade one um but i think all three of them could be reported all three is coming back on the report okay but as far as i 'm aware i have been told that they are on allocated projects otherwise they wouldn 't be they wouldn 't be internal restrictions i i would assume at least some of these events spent i was mid-shocked that they were so high likely that will come back further down the bottom um six lines from the bottom it talks about rail crossing update 38 000. just wondering what that is [Music] allocated to that should we have to put lights and whistles across others reach or those types of things it 's a small allocation as you can attest that restricted amount through the chair i would suspect if you ask that question of the technical service director we 'd probably say you might need to provide more in the future through through the chair it 's really subject to othr and what happens with regard to their ozara approvals regarding rolling stock but it 's it 's a reserve for the existing uh rail crossings across many locations to do any maintenance or required work um it 's mutual safety so that 's my understanding in terms of the being put aside just for that particular purpose okay madam mayor if i could the residential dwellings amount is that something to do with our living units or what 's that to do with a reserve to for maintenance through the chair it 's our independent living unit yes right component and i 'm getting a nod from my director in a way off location so independently and the next week what 's that 328 000. they are some internal restricted funds for projects that that are being undertaken in the works area so that will currently is that how much uh work we can get through i can 't guarantee that that is the intent for the ambition yes and i know i should know probably but what 's the next one 50 prepayment so through the mayor we receive the pre-paid the payments um before the financial year and this is just a restriction and over the financial year it 's spread out financial assistance okay so then we go to independent living units we have 546 000 yet we 've already i thought dealt with that under residential dwellings under 100 000. so combined we have 646 000 for our independent living units do we why do we have two categories so through the mayor the independent living units 546 was created as part of the new development and they will be combined at a point in time when that project is completed and if that 's the case um how much of that is likely to be spent and how much is likely to remain i believe in the independent living units uh 546 i believe that a large portion of that probably about i there there is some maintenance in there for the units it 's not all the um grant or the funding project for the development i 'm happy to bring back more details across the whole range of our units not just the curtis street units yes that 's correct um thank you on page 154 i can cross these consolidate accounts on materials and contracts are we saying that we have budgeted 234 2 million 345 000 and that we 've actually spent by december 202 2 million 250 769 of that through the that is correct um that includes uh the um that figure will adjust as we move through with the grants projects and the other projects that we 're doing it is purely a timing issue at this point in time so we still think that the budgeted and revised budget of 2.345092 is correct that 's correct yes the so if i 'm i was a little confused at the top of page 155 under the water fund where interest and investment revenue was budgeted at 900 and sorry nine thousand three hundred and seventy six and we have this and the revised budget 's the same but we have an actual um actual figure which is negative one five three seven um and once again this is a timing thing the um investments are allocated across the different funds at the end of financial year it 's not something we do on a month-to-month basis okay [Music] and on page 156 and i know this is an income expenses budget review statement but unless i 'm wrong we all always at the end of the day seem to have a surplus in leadership and engagement at the end of this and everything else is normally in the red when we come to the netting out at the end and i must admit i never quite understand all these categories um but this seems to be what happens every year that we 're in surplus and leadership engagement yet we 're always in the in the red for the others is this normal practice and procedure it is a normal practice and i hesitated in putting this page statement strategic plan in there because it is adjusted at the end of financial year okay well we 'll look forward to seeing at the end of the financial year okay probably say it um the end of march it will probably be more interesting madam mayor i am [Music] thank you at 157 councillors 14 10 legal and consultancy fees recommendation is that reporters researchers information and move the place that 's when the technical thank you that 's six monthly delivery plan report the recommendation is that the reporters receive this information can i have a mover please counsel kellum thank you and can i have a second to please trust the thank you thank you councillor kellum um report for information divides out of how we 've performed over the last six months um unfortunately it 's mostly green or yellow and this proves that we 're doing yes that sums it up pretty well i guess and then and i took notice of the the the last paragraph in the comments their council asked to note progress achieved in the first 18 months delivery program taking into consideration some progress might be slower than think overall i think we 've done it well councilman the other comments and this one i 'm

lauren trimbart from the oak o 'connell valley community group who 'd like to make a presentation to us this evening i 'm assuming that lauren is online i 'm here renee can we get visual on lauren thank you good evening lauren welcome welcome thank you okay um i 'll ask for the presentation this opportunity to present on behalf of the o 'connell valley community group if we go to the next page please sharing so i just wanted to um discuss the current da for belfast 10 2020.36.1 and the um issues that we 're going to cover are the oberon development control plan land use conflicts the lep and the o 'connell heritage conservation area public interest building envelopes and impact to heritage conservation area tree planting and lots and access points next page as i 'm sure you 're aware um the before objective state council is obliged to promote high quality subdivision within the oberon council area which minimises adverse impacts on the environment the ob the o 'connell valley community group would like to see council move urgently on updating the development control plan to ensure these developments and future developments do not continue to reduce the local rule immediately and is up and is up to date and reflected of 2020 and beyond i 'm not sure how long before we can have an updated dcp it appears to be no date or plan and at this fabric of the community and moved on without bearing the consequences of poorly planned development surrounding councils have updated their dcps blaney 2018 bathurst 2014 cara 2014 maggie also the midwestern 2013 the upper lachlan 2010 and lithgow has a draft in progress why can we not get ours updated until a new gcp has developed we urge council to use the full extent of the current dcp when considering development applications and in particular this da and it is as it is within the heritage conservation area it 's quite different rezoning does not green light development that doesn 't appropriate consider or respond to local impacts convey some sensitivities the statement of environmental effects prepared by vormin and stratsep for the developers newton ruley rural grossly underestimates the impact of rezoning of the belvoir uh six lot development with five additional lots at 2451 o 'connell road it sits within the o 'connell heritage conservation area classified as a conservation area by the national trust in 1974 and in 1978 was listed on the heritage register of the national state o 'connell has the only heritage conservation area page and this is just about potential land use conflicts now that we have a large ru1 property it 's being split and now blends and confuses its own zoning objectives next page the heritage historical significance clause 5.10 5 of the oberon local environment plan states that council will require heritage management to document to be prepared assess the extent to which the carrying out of the proposed development would affect the heritage significance of the heritage item or heritage conservation area concerned where the land joins or is in the vicinity of a heritage item or conservation area the oberon lep requires council to consider how development identifies protects conserves and enhances oberon 's natural assets and to identify and protect oberon 's built and cultural assets for future generations can we request that heritage management plan be obtained prior to the approval of this da next page and this is just a little background i 'm sure everyone 's aware but it 's just to refresh everyone that the o 'connell cultural landscape is significant as an intact example of continuously fashioning rural landscape we have some coxs road is an historic staging post and key to european colonization of inland new south wales there is strong historical association with the hassel family a prominent pioneering family in colonial new south wales and there is high significance for aesthetic values as an intact picturesque pastoral setting including its historic buildings and there is high potential to yield arched archaeological information on vernacular building technologies and traditions in the next page please the rural aesthetic we do not believe the key views to the economy urban conservation area have been adequately considered and the developers are playing with words such as council must confirm what determines or constitutes a visual impact on the o 'connell heritage conservation area we do not believe the location of future dwellings and out buildings has been considered fully by council there is reference on page 75 to the development being referred to the council 's heritage advisor the developer refers to requested additions and amendments being made as per the heritage advisor 's request these amendments appear to be just the inclusions of ridgeline and protection of cox 's road council notes however however with careful placement of a future dwelling on the western portion of proposed lot 10 can avoid unreasonable impact due to the ridgeline running through the center of the allotment personally the kiln valley community group do not believe that it should be approved in this ga it is clearly going to be an issue and the developer is making an issue for council to deal with the developer is aware of their obligations with regard to the heritage conservation area and should be asked to fill this request as the heritage advisor reviewed the amended plan and approved and aware that no building envelopes have been provided although this was a request from council and the obgcg would like to see restrictions imposed prevent further subdivision if greater than 20 hectares due to this land being within the heritage conservation area next page actually we can just pass that next page eight sharon i think it 's a little bit repetitious i went over it myself today public interest the environmental planning and assessment act requires the public interest to be considered when assessing development applications community that the overall objective of the epna act is to provide more public participation in the planning process the o 'connell community have placed significant public interest in the proposed subdivision its pattern and design as well as others surrounding the heritage conservation area what has become apparent that no matter how many submissions or requested considerations from the community the council of passing das and the current dcp although very out of date could be used to set conditions when approving a da it appears to be a very narrow use of the current gcp but again highlights the urgent need for an updated tcp 2001 is just too old compared to the other councils who have taken the time to update if we could just go to the building envelopes please next slide the objective of the rfi large lot residential zone is to provide residential housing in a rural setting while preserving and minimizing impacts on environmentally sensitive locations and sand equality the heritage conservation area will be impacted if any dwellings are approved and no building envelopes provided as part of the da now as discussed the application does not exist does not seek approval for any dwelling buildings or the structures apart from driver entrances to each lot therefore potential impact on the heritage conservation area cannot be tangibly assessed or concluded at this stage however the developer in his response back to council 27 july 2020 regarding amendments on page 91 was highly dismissive of the heritage conservation area and dwelling envelopes with comments such as council must also confirm what determines or constitutes a visual impact on the o 'connell heritage conservation area and again with the ridgeline has been added to the plan to demonstrate this it would be inappropriate to restrict dwelling sites upon or on the eastern side of the bridge when the dwelling may well have a positive visual impact on the heritage conservation area i 'm not sure how that would be positive we request that as part of the approval of this da that our council has moved an amendment to the da to include building envelopes for lots 10 11 and 12 and 13 to protect the heritage conservation area as per close 5.105 of the plan and make this conditional to the da being approved the owner should not be on the council on such a significant heritage conservation area the developer when purchasing belvar would have been fully aware of the significance and obligations to retain and protect the heritage conservation area and they cannot now say that it 's not an issue let 's go to the next slide there 's also tree preservation and plantings the council has approved developments such as warago lane and is now spending 140 000 on tree plantings when this should have been the responsibility of the developer at the time council formed a tree and landscape committee for the uber and lga but in o 'connell the oberon taxpayers funds are now being used to fix what a developer should have been requested abroad as part of the va approval true plantings on lots 10 and 11 and 12 should be part of the approval of this sta on the ridge lines to protect the heritage conservation area as well as beaconsfield road across the frontages of lots 10 11 12 and 13 and again on corridors o 'connell is well known as a koala habitat and it should be protected we request that councils move a tree planting amendment as conditional to the approval of this da next slide lots and access points there have been considerable upgrading of the fencing and at the same time new fully recessed access points replacing some existing farm gates on box flat road however the amended map only references two existing access points and the proposed at gates for lots 10 11 12 and 13 would be an existing one on that road there are new access gates on blocks that road and the question would be were these approved by council prior and what is the process to put in new recess gates lot 13 is a curious anomaly on the map it has an access point marked on the map page 85 but an old cattle gate that existed at the corner of box flat and beaconsfield road is now a new fully recessed access point was this council approved and why would it sit on the corner of lot 13 when another access gate on will it be removed it would be a traffic hazard if it was used as it is now beaconsfield road access points will the developer have conditions set to ensure that existing trees are not removed to provide access to lots 10 11 and 12. page 62 of the council 's report refers to access points to lot 15 which i think is an error figure 5 is on beaconsfield road but figure 4 would be the corner of beaconsfield and box flat road and again the traffic had has it at this intersection but i do think that 's an error lot 14 o 'connell road a new fully recessed access gate has replaced a single stop date and google maps can be referenced to see the old cattle gate position has rms approved this gate and is there a plan to use this as an access point for this current da or future das because there is a correlation between line of sight and speed are these plans to reduce speed limits on box flat or beaconsfield road and potentially o 'connell road we are not requesting this again reducing speed limits as the area becomes a suburb and not a mixed rural area in the next slide in conclusion the connell valley community group urged oberon council to be mindful of best planning principles environmental law requirements and statutory obligations in its consideration of our concerns the gcp although out of date must be used on its fullest extent to access the da application as this the communi community response reflects major public interest in this development and the recent content development within the heritage conservation area we would particularly ask that before approving this da that due consideration be given to the heritage conservation area with conditions for tree planting in the impact of the heritage conservation area due to the proximity of this subdivision and request a heritage management plan and define dwelling envelopes be a condition to protect the heritage conservation area if those defined dwelling envelopes are not put in place a purchaser of that land is going to find out how restricted they are when they put it in a data council and i think that is not the correct way that marked because of the proximity to the heritage conservation area it doesn 't really impact other developments in the same way but as i said before the developer purchased this land knowing full well that they sit within the heritage conservation area and they need to have some responsibility and not just push it back to council and potentially tax pays when trouble arises with new people coming in and wanting to build their homes on a piece of land that they 've paid a lot of money for and in actual fact they 're quite dud we 'd also like to see the access points we would also request that all access points are updated on the plan are relevant and confirmed that all have been approved by council and the rms were applicable the o 'connell valley community are not against development and see it as the future and a good percentage of residents already live in lots that have been split from large ru1 by myself these are not people with sectional interests or wanting to keep o 'connell in the 19th century what the community are beautiful heritage area and that new developments are well planned and we as a community can only rely on our elected councillors to ensure this happens thank you for your time and thank you for the opportunity to present thank you lauren um are you um happy to take a few questions if there are any sure if i can answer them are there any comments counselors or anything you 'd like to direct to lauren councillor mckibben hello councilman kevin thank you madame um lauren in uh in your presentation you state that there should be restrictions on subdivisions of areas greater than 20 hectares can you specify what you would be suggesting all those restrictions would be and why they should not apply to under 20 hectares i think it 's more around this particular that 's my first area the other thing is i get the impression sorry and in respect to um any subdivision where there are going to be residences which are obviously subject to a da 's not to the current plan but the sub the subdivision will provide the allotments for residences to be built on the heritage side of the ridgeline that would look into or impact on that heritage area okay in response the second question is particularly related to the belvoir and those lots and if you look at the the map and um if they if a lot of people build on the ridgeline and they build on the ridgeline for the view it 's not about any other um developments at all i mean people would like to see um places below the ridgeline but i can see them from where i am everywhere you know that 's that 's it it 's more about protecting the heritage conservation area and it 's quite apparent that if you were to put the building envelopes just on those lots they are going to be down by the road and that 's going to be a problem when someone purchased it i 'm not saying about any other developments maybe that would be a new updated dcp but currently we 're working with what we have and it 's really just about protecting the heritage conservation area and it was could be a positive impact to see a roof line um into that area and it 's it 's a rural vista and with regards to restrictions on over 20 hectares it 's more again around this particular development that um we have uh two ru1 and that is used and should be retained for uh farming and potentially it will get it 'll get eaten up and disappeared into smaller lots and that 's why i was asking about the gate on o 'connell road because it seems like it already proved to have another house on that that area because it 's been reduced to 100 and that makes it makes sense because that 's the way to go if they want to divide up the land but another rezoning and we 'll see all of that land disappear and it is meant to be mixed rural and residential thank you lauren any uh councilman cabin councilman kevin are you done how 's it going no matter further questions um as i understand it and the general manager might correct me currently the zoning in this area as current zoning ie ru1 and um and that is in the lep currently so that an applicant provided they comply with those frequents and is entitled to subdivide in accordance with the particular zoning so if that is the case if council was to oppose this on unreasonable grounds i would understand that the applicant could take us to court [Music] and in that event we would have some difficulties so is the oberon valley community prepared for us to go to court on that and prepared to indemnify us if our legal advice advises us that we would be on shaky ground and if so out of what assets i don 't think that 's exactly a fair question that we would want to see the council go to court and we are very aware that the dcp as it stands is very out of date and of course the developers are going to use that and come in and pillage and plunder and do whatever they wish but this particular development sits on the heritage conservation area and you within the gcp do state that it 's to envelopes to be included as part of the plan is only fair or is every real estate agent that sells those five lots going to let the people know that there is a considerable restrictions on where they will be able to put a dwelling is that a buyer beware so i 'm not asking council to go to court i 'm fully aware that developers know exactly what they can do here and will do it and it will happen but this is a heritage conservation area that you should be considering thank you lauren councillor mccarthy because um may we call you lauren you may call me lauren um lauren um where did you get the figure for the trees the cost of the trees in um warrego lane it was provided at a previous o 'connell valley community group if i 've got that incorrect um that was the number that was quoted it was also put in our minutes okay um thank you and you 're aware of um number seven in the report um i was a part of the uh heritage conservation area and the council would accept at the time but in the report it says that lock number 10 to 13 um can be located on the other side the ridgeline from the heritage conservation area doesn 't that suffice enough well it 's what i 'm what i 'm pointing out to you is that if you don 't put the building envelopes in especially 10 10 it sits adjacent to the heritage conservation area so and you it even dylan has put in his notes that have to be very careful placement of any dwelling on that block and then you 've got 11 and 12 who have got full view unless they 're pushed down below the ridgeline they will be up looking down onto the heritage conservation area so i appreciate that you put them in but what i 'm saying if i was coming along to purchase and i purchased that land number 10 and then i find out that the only place i can probably put my dwelling is close to the road and the rest of it 's not to be used i would consider to say how did this happen okay and the other one just it 's not with this report there is one um building entitlement left in the heritage conservation area would you oppose any dwelling being placed on that even though they have an entitlement certainly think that that 's what we 're discussing here tonight council mccarthy thank you i i 'm completely unaware of it so that would be hard for me to make a comment okay thank you councillor doni news thank you madam mayor i 'm just well there 's the yellow square um what 's the discussion of the building envelopes i recognize um uh the difficulty here for uh just first on council on the given um i don 't nobody in this presentation as i understand it is denying the legal right of the um the zoning and the developer to do as they wish i believe the presentations relating to how we exercise our development control plan and in interpreting that what conditions we may put on an approval so the conditions don 't deny an approval uh correct me if i enforcing a development control plan on further development applications within the rezoned area building envelopes our planner on page 90 of the report says dwelling envelopes should be added to the amended plan demonstrating that future dwellings can be located below ridgeline in a location which ensures there is not a visual impact on the o 'connell heritage conservation area it 's a statement but it is not there as a condition of the um approval and you know i i think it should be and i draw your attention to counsel donnie can i interrupt you there please lauren is here to give a presentation this evening on behalf of a community group the debate that we seem to be going into now can be had when the item comes up for consideration later in the meeting certainly madame is just trying to clarify some points if you have a question for lauren very happy to take it uh no i don 't think i have a question matt in there i 'm happy with that presentation thank you is there any other questions for lauren councillors okay lauren 's not an easy thing to do a presentation um we thank you and as you know we 'll be considering this matter later on in the meeting so thank you very much thank you kathy thank you everyone are we right lynette you okay councillors we move on to the meeting now we go on to pay we 're on page six we have questions from the public due to the current cover 19 pandemic and in accordance with the newly legislated state government requirements the october meeting will be undertaken as a virtual meeting conducting using webinar facilities the general manager has requested that all questions from the public must be submitted in writing prior to 1pm on tuesday the 20th of october 2020 members of the public who submit a question to council are permitted to do so provided the following guidelines are hadid too the person lodging the question must advise of their name and in what capacity capacity they 're acting if the person lodging the question is acting as another person or organization 's agent they must advise counsel if they have their prior opportunity for debate with elected representatives or staff it is an opportunity for the community to ask a question in relation to an issue or put a point of view relating to an issue that may be causing interest or concern due to time constraints a time frame of three minutes per speaker is allocated the general manager will now read out any questions submitted at this point in time questions will be taken on notice and a response provided within a reasonable time frame if they cannot be answered this evening general manager uh thank you madam mayor we currently have all questions from the public i 'll read one at a time the first one 's from uh hardy draham madam marion councillors residents asked in 2018 if council could reinstate the christmas decorations leading to the grotto event in 2019 which is now cancelled christmas lights and decorations are all covered free having done the preparations and purchases of lights and infrastructure last year many residents would welcome sharing the christmas spirit especially after a tumultuous year a is it the intent of council to honor the bigger and better for 2020. the initial request for the decorations uh the initial request was for decorations b are councils comfortable to leave the allocated funds to community groups as per today 's agenda item 1303 to a single person without proper process in place to ensure transparency after all the council is handling handing out rate payer funds c would not be far more equitable to allocate the full amount of 8 000 to make up for last year 's shortfall completing past promises instead of only 3 000 seemingly short delivering past promises by the council residents asked for lights and decorations council renamed the event to the community christmas grotto in its proposed potential savings plan changing the focus away from the original request the wording in 1303 leaves it open to allocate less or none of the five thousand dollars creating a windfall saving for the council delivering the highlighted two thousand dollar savings even though it was not approved by stealth the second part is during september the dirty water issue caused residents and businesses a lot of grief announcement by council blame various council 's own records show also television pump fire leading to the treatment tank and reticulated town water getting overdosed with potassium permanganate a chemical used to control excessive manganese levels uh high doses of potassium permanganate pumped excessively without control for unknown durations and unknown concentrations would have all done would have done all sorts of damage to the w to the rws piping system flocculating any build up of accumulated manganese a what has council done to prevent reoccurrence of these issues the was there no spare pumping council store requiring a different pump to be rigged up in the panic see why was the 11 year old pump not identified as being a risk d does the council use condition monitoring to safeguard future failures or mission critical equipment e is the wtp staff sufficiently with operators and engineering staff trained adequately after recent staff turnover so that such event does not happen again if given the real reason as declared by council itself was a pump failure will the council reimburse president residents and businesses for losses experience ranging from wasted water soil clothes and loss _''_2188.16 act of god this was caused by council and action ought to be taken agenda item 1410 is completely inaccurate to resolve this issue without the council showing actual water quality readings and the root cause analysis the gibberish is meaningless point one how can council state that there are pump failures leading into leading to potassium permanganate overdosing treatment tank and town outside the wastewater w the rws and then stayed in 1410 at no time during this event was operation of the wtp an issue two is potassium permanganate dosing pump not part of the wtp three unless council shows actual water quality readings the report 1410 is nothing more than a personal opinion this is a systematic failure of council deliver one of its most basic functions clean drinking water can these records be made available to the public point three of hardy graham 's questions is a submission in regards to open and closed council i 'll do that at the time prior to council going into into closed session should should you be happy with that madam mayor and four would gm wallace please elaborate the director of planning resign was announced today lasting around 170 days a is that a record b what is the average tenure of staff employed since gm wallace was appointed see why the council has not addressed one of the obvious obvious flaws attracting and keeping competent staff d what was wrong with the selection process this time for ratepayers having paid out hard-earned cash for advertising selection interviews and medical costs thank you general manager um i will um i will just comment on mr dreheim 's questions i will personally not be responding to any further correspondence from mr dreiheim after years of offensive unpleasant vexatious and disrespectful commentary directed at me through various media platforms by mr dreheim i have decided that it is time to call out this unacceptable inappropriate and egregious behaviour neither will i be responding by not calling out this behaviour i am actually enabling it neither will i be responding in course to any correspondence from the oberon shire residence and ratepayers association whilst mr dreyheim is involved with the group comments made by mr dryharm in the name of the all members are not productive nor in keeping with the published aims of the organization opinion does not equal fact but respect does engender respect it is interesting to note that harassment and or bullying is unacceptable at any level not calling it out for what it is sets a poor example to all especially our young people i reiterate that this is a personal decision on my behalf and may not reflect the views of other councillors or council staff i 'll now hand over to the general manager to respond as you see spit to mr draham 's questions thank you madam mayor i 'll just raise it i believe point one and point two will be taken on notice um point three will be discussed and in regard to point four the matters relate to individual personal and not relevant to anyone beyond the organization and will not be responded to in open council thank you madam mayor question two comes from keith sullivan you 'll recall that for many years there have been requests made on behalf of the considerable number of oberon residents to recommission there has been no light since the big pine tree was dropped in apex park in the past response from council has been there is nothing in the budget up until last year when 10 000 was spent on the christmas grotto i also understand that a request for christmas lights has been made directly to councillor brenda lyon with negative responses being given for the reasons for not conceding to the request on this basis i can assume that without the support of the chairman that the support from committee recommending christmas lights will not be forthcoming could i please put a question to council if it is not too late as to why this council has deviated from the traditional christmas lights and continues to refuse requests to install fairy lights over the christmas period particular zobron is known as the king of the fairies the cost of you installation is understood not to be significant due to the low capital cost of lighting utilizing solar power which if agreement could be reached with the shop owners could be left all year round providing a magical image and on notice general manager or responding i 'm happy to take that one on notice thank you um the third one 's from phillip haynes i 'm asking this question again as you did not answer in the august 2020 meeting claiming i did not have permission from the oberon show the repo 's association so this time i 'm asking as a private individual not as a representative of any association club political party group organisation fraternity union bct can we assume i am a rate payer and i am a long time resident this is a question for the public at today 's council meeting mayor sagewitz when will council enable the zoom feature to unmute the attendee asking the questions so that they give they can give a response and interact with councillors as was done in chambers and no i 'm not talking about a debate as an example in chambers we always had the option to clarify a question when the answer didn 't when the answer given did not answer the question right now questions to counsel for the most part are a waste other councils are doing at the moment it 's just too easy to follow off a question if you asked a vendor a question about a product you 'd purchased and they didn 't care and just said we 've already answered your question or i 'll get back to you how long do you think you 'd be a customer what kind of dreadful customer service is that how long would their business last provider service are paid by the community and dues and and do so and ought to do it to the satisfaction of the community like other councils are doing at the moment over on council could put a lot more focus on satisfying their community in other words their customers could you also please respond in writing to the writing the answer to the question thank you general manager in fact i did answer this question at the august council meeting and this is reflecting the adopted minutes of that meeting the response has not changed and i quote to reiterate the preface to questions from the public states questions from the public is not is an opportunity for the community to ask a question or put a point of view forward that may be causing interest or concern that can be checked in the minutes for the august meeting thank you general manager thank you madam mayor the last um correspondence is from borman and radzip who references made to da10 2020 36.1 being a six subdivision

for preparing a well-balanced report with respect to the proposed subdivision that addresses the concerns and counters the objections raised during the public exhibition period of the development application the recommendation that council approved the development is an appropriate response previous development applications to subdivide r5 zone land into 10 hectare allotments in the o 'connell area concerns about environmental traffic heritage and social impacts on the area have been consistently raised and it is to be noted that these would be dealt with at the planning proposal stage to resign the land in 2013. the proposal is considered to be acceptable in terms of section 4.15 the environment planning assessment 1979 there are no planning grounds to refuse the development

done thank you councillor page 11 councillors item 1001 notices of motion design of underground power for town beautification the motion is that oberon council engage a level 4 electrical designer to obtain a town beautification at the following sites over on street west of dudley street to raleigh street over on street raleigh street to existing completed works the mover police councillors council mccarthy do we have a secondary councillor downey thank you mr council mccarthy you wish to speak to the motion uh i think it 's pretty straightforward um we just just seem to be standing on our hands with this improvement a long-term plan we don 't seem to be moving ahead so i 've submitted this anyway so see how we go council darning thank you madam there um uh just an element of costing in here engaging a level four electrical designer i uh support the the idea um uh and uh in my review of it i thought there was some element of reflecting costing do we have a opinion of costing on this from um staff madame it 's my understanding not as yet but i 'll defer to the general manager here madam mayor a costume hasn 't been undertaken there 's been some quotes being obtained but certainly costings and where council would like further report councilman mckibben uh thank you madame i i would propose an amendment the amendment would be that oberon council obtained quotes from electrical designers for undertaking detailed design for undergrounding power lines in the two areas specified in the existing motion and a fourth um a fourth that 'll be the first point the fourth point would be uh that i 've drawn council on completion uh if the detail and that would obviously if it 's under a certain amount and i would suggest ten thousand dollars that the general manager should be authorized to proceed uh with one and two and the final point would be that um if the detailed design um is undertaken the council then obtain a quote for the cost of putting this power underground and coming back to council i haven 't expressed that absolutely correctly but i think the gist is understood right how does that look uh sharon would it not be better councillors to have a report back to council on this uh look i 'm happy happy with that madame i was just thinking that if it manager could proceed without having to come back so that we at least get it underway which i think was councillor mccarthy i understand councilman this we also have to identify a funding source so i think a report back to council would be a preferable option councillor mccarthy madame could we add a third dot point that the town beautification town improvement fund be used as a source and it 'd be limited to ten thousand dollars maybe that 'll suffice okay so we have an amendment here that and council mckibben has put up is your amendment still stand before i call for a second to council mckibben um yes maybe i should rephrase the amendment yes okay if you could rephrase the amendment for sharon who will then bring it up on the screen and i will then call for a second so the motion would be oberon council colon one obtain quotes from electrical appropriate level four electrical designers or undergrounding the power lines in colon a one o bronze street west of dudley street to rally street semicolon and two oberon street rally street for quote is within and if the success if the best quote obtained is under ten thousand dollars and the general manager can asset can obtain funds from the streetscape working group or such other source then a designer be engaged to undertake that work new paragraph was probably four um that on completion of the design work a costing be obtained by the general manager for undertaking the actual works of undergrounding the power at the above two locations can i just say that the town beautification working party does not have any funds at its disposal yes i thought that might be the case so adam if i can if we can just step in the only possible option i would suspect given that would be potentially the town beautification money from the existing ti fund or from ti unallocated there will be a council 's discretion to make their their um option known i would suggest the ti unallocated then madame [Music] slot that in please sharon rather than the town beautification fund if we could put that on the screen when when you 're ready could i quote obtained is under 10 10 000. okay 10 000. then the general manager is directed to obtain funds from the town improvement fund and allocated for the uh for the design and then the designer be pointed to doesn 't take the work you happy with that how that reads counselor um i think um then the general manager is directed to obtain funds from the town improvement fund allocated [Music] unallocated the designer be appointed to undertake the world look will be the designer i 'm assuming the one that was the best quote well maybe we might make it the best quote management if where do you want to put the best quote counselor i 'm just thinking the best quote because not the best quote is not always the um if the most suitable most appropriate most suitable quote of paint if the most suitable quote obtained is instead of best if the most suitable quote obtained is under ten thousand dollars in the general manager and i can 't really entice who thought can is entitled to source or utilize the general can utilize is um can i suggest madame be delicated be delegated will you the general manager be delegated to use yes okay you happy with that councilman kevin i think in three if the detailed design is detained then the general manager obtain a cost um for each of the areas in one are in ill kind of cost for 1a and 1b each of one a and one areas each of the areas identified would cover that yes each of the yeah that 's fine for each of the areas identified because maybe we determined to go ahead with one but not the other okay councillors you can read uh council mckibben 's amendment there he has moved that i would now need a seconder for this to proceed on for discussion councils please sorry i can 't_''_3692.16 you have to wait till i can see the screen do we have a seconder counselor callum okay so the amendment sits there is there any discussion on the amendment counsellors councilman mccallum councillor callum do you wish to talk to this mayor i 'm happy with the war that 's now been to make it happen okay any other comments on this one on the amendment counsellors if not i 'm going to put the amendment as was on the screen all in favor of the amendment in all in favor encourage unanimously the amendment now becomes the motion all in favor of the motion thank you councillors the motions carried unanimously

noted can i have a mover please counselor downey thank you and councillor kellum thank you counselor danny do you wish to speak to the recommendation thank you madam mayor just briefly um uh certainly some interesting information in there just looking um a particular interest uh in the in the area of water and i note that the you know major projects the y angler dam wall raising um i 'm just asking if you have and i 've read your notes here um the applicability of this to over on um do you have a comment to direct issues that arise out of this uh affecting us i was looking for duck malloy i couldn 't see anything there the only direct reference to oberon would be the macquarie system report other than that no but i can 't assure you that oberon 's water issues our dam levels have been taken up by the jo and we 've have had a meeting or two to get our case put on the matrix and in front of the minister but in this actual report it was more of a regional report and the only uh reference really is the macquarie system thank you very much i 'm happy with rupaul thank you council kellum thank you madam mayor the only question i have is that it talks about a rough regional leadership executive and an attached draft report from that organisation in second paragraph on page 15 and uh yeah i don 't seem to have it no that that was a slideshow um i 'm uncertain as to whether that actually came to council in my absence or not and if it hasn 't i can you i would be interested in that i will forward it to all counsellors thank you any other comments on this one counsellors put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you where i 'm now on page 26 committee reports item 1201 community services committee extraordinary meeting the recommendation is that the

councillor kellum thank you a seconder council mccarthy thank you do you wish to speak to this counselor callum uh yes madam mayor um that meeting did cancel the christmas card because on once it was recognised that the number of people that would who attended last year if that was repeated it would be quite difficult to maintain appropriate covered measures and we don 't know what the covered measures are going to be in december so you 've got to take these things early take the decisions early so that you can have certainty for sponsors and the community service community uh meeting then decided make that decision at the november meeting which i think is a sensible and uh appropriate way to go about business thank you councillor council mccarthy uh the november meeting gives the people to have input so i 'm happy with that thank you thank you any other comments on this one councillors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you 29 item 1202 cta

our policies for procurement contract and project management as covering the sentient report and that was agreed and also we discussed the fact that members of councillors and members of the staff

the rugby league ground yeah through the chair there has been some uh previous discussion about lighting uh however nothing further has been raised at this stage i think given the uh some discussions uh in relation to the future of the sporting ground in essence so nothing at this stage councilman mccarthy just just a concern that couldn 't these lights be if requested couldn 't be relocated if something changes through the chair again look i 'd have to take that on notice councillor mccarthy and um yeah for the discussion but i think that uh it would take some um some erecting of probably

endorsed the uniform policy 2107 as presented subject to a change to item for embroidery on page three of that proposed policy to replace human resource resources coordinator with human resources manager councilman the motion has been um [Music] proposed and seconded so i think it would need to be an amendment now i can 't propose an amendment so i 'd ask someone else to any response here counselors madam mayor this is this is a minor amendment in one paragraph of one that full process uh we can adjust the um adjust that word and still endorse the policy okay through the chair we 'll do that if the council is happy for us just to amend that that word so councilman kevin can you just repeat i 'm happy madam yeah you 're happy okay could you point out again to me please about embroidery you said it it 's page page 53 of the council papers but it 's page three of the policy top of the page heading for embroidery yeah if you go to the second paragraph second line it says human resources coordinator it should be the human resources manager council callum you 've got an objection to that i understand i have no objection okay counsellors there any other comments on this one counsellors i 'll put the recommendation with that change all in favor carrie thank you page 59 councillors item 1302 development application one zero two zero two zero dot three six dot one six lot subdivision five additional allotments there is a recommendation in two part counselors that council approved development application 102020.36.1 lot 401 in dp one two six three eight zero zero being known as one two one two four five one o 'connell rhode o 'connell in accordance with section 4.16 of the environmental environmental planning and assessment act 1979 and conditions contained within this report for the following reasons all proposed allotments are of the minimum size for dwelling permissibility of 10 hectares r5 zone and a hundred hectares are one zone all relevant objectives and controls within the oberon local environmental plan 2013 and the oberon development control plan 2001 i met by the proposal the development is considered not to unreasonably impact flora and fauna in relation to the biodiversity conservation act 2017 and the state environmental planning policy bracket koala habitat protection 2019 council 's technical services department and heritage advisor are satisfied with the subdivision layout overall the subdivision is considered to be designed appropriately in regard to its social environmental and economic impacts on the locality point two a division would be called in a court record in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993. do i have a mover of move that with an additional dot point that we request building envelopes for lots 10 to 13. so i don 't know whether i get a second for that so that 's a six dot point requesting building envelopes for lot 10 to 13. 10 to 13. yes do i have a secondary with that additional dot point counsellors counselor callum thank you council mccarthy do you wish to speak to this just all right sorry madame just before we go into this that is a condition rather than a reason and it needs to be a dot point three uh sorry a condition three rather not point now what i 'm suggesting is that that becomes condition and the division be the final the final condition on the development um as council may request further further conditions to be added um that may change but the division should be the last yeah okay thank you thank you general manager council mccarthy so now we 've got number one is the um five existing dot points though right five yes number two will be um request for billing envelopes for correct that 's correct yeah um i 'm happy with that madam mayor um one of my major concerns is um expressed by the lady that people can buy these lots and then they um understand that they can 't impact on the hca and um yeah and the ridgeline so if that was in there they know that when they purchase these lots this is a condition thank you thank you councillor councillor callum uh i agree with mccarthy i think it 's important that we do have um proposed health sorry thank you madam mayor i agree with council mccarthy i think it 's important that the lots have a proposed building site or aced building envelope so that uh people are aware of the the effect of the heritage area on their ability to build good thank you councillor mckibbin thank you mr man um look i i support the resolution and i support the proposed change uh proposed by council mccarthy and seconded by deputy mckellar however i think that the proposed change um we can 't we can 't just say um that lots 10 is that appropriate building envelopes that seek to protect the heritage nature of the village or something a bit more specific and who 's going to determine those building envelopes are we asking the developer to put the building envelopes in or are we asking council and the development to come to an agreement as to what those building envelopes should be that are put in the approval um i i think it needs to be a bit more definitive than what has actually been currently suggest because as i understand it um obviously the occult valley group has suggested building envelopes that um are away from the ridge line and lower down uh towards uh not on the ridgeline so if we 're going to do those building envelop voting that we 're actually putting into this suggested change can i take some advice from the general manager players on this wording madam mayor this is where your dot points do come in quite handy and a provision of an additional dot point to say um to protect the ongoing uh amenity of the o 'connell urban conservation area dot point to those to those um reasons if council would like to it doesn 't need a a an additional condition to highlight why just the reasons behind it and that will be put into a put into a an approval document so you 're saying it 's not necessary to delineate specifically building envelopes on those specific blocks you 're saying an overall statement would uh cover that is that what you 're saying general manager sorry miss sorry madam mayor i think you 've misunderstood suggesting is that if council were to um resolve to accept the condition as it sits now a simple further dot point in addition to in addition to the okay in condition one saying something along the lines um to protect the amenity of the urban conservation area that will be the reason behind the condition being added okay so you don 't need to justify the reason as councillor mckibben has indicated when you can use reasons to do that for you so to be simply if that condition was to be applied i would recommend a further dot point indicating conservation area as the justification and the reasoning behind the condition thank you have you got any objection to that council mccarthy council mccarthy no no counselor kellum you happy with that suggestion from the general manager uh i 'm happy with that suggestion yes thank you and councillor mckibben that satisfies your concerns thank you madame yes i believe it does counselor donnie council danny you 're muted just still try here thank you very much on the um amendment um i draw council 's attention to page 90 of the report point number two and i do commend um the um uh a town planner i 'm not sure of the correct title for um uh putting in some work i don 't always agree with all of his conclusions but i think it 's a much more comprehensive report than we 've had in the past but he notes that developing developed dwelling op envelopes should be added to the amended plan demonstrating that future dwellings can be located below ridgeline in a location etc that is not a visual impact on the o 'connell heritage conservation from our tan planner to meet this additional 0.3 and i draw council 's attention to the importance of that because if they go to the warragul lane subdivision where it too boarded the heritage conservation area and the key aspect of the heritage conservation area is its scenic and cultural heritage there is a house that has been built and i don 't know how it happened smack on the top of the ridgeline where in fact the whole concept that the conservation area was that that was not to occur so we need to guard against this that unless we do protect it the same thing could could happen again i would then also um uh like to foreshadow a further amendment i 'm not sure where we 're up to with that we don 't have an amendment at the moment councillor we have an alternate recommendation an alternate recommendation tonight on that uh we did come from the parthian council callum so i can would like to just suggest a further amendment than that okay you don 't want can you tell me what it what to speak to it um i would like a uh an additional point um requesting um the development of a um a tree plan for the subdivision and i would like it to have a number of elements uh the first one would be that it is a um tier one koala habitat and the recommendation under t1 on page 68 there is the possible recommendation that um the developer or purchasers of the blocks just be encouraged it 's not a comp it 's not compulsory encouraged to um undertake strategic plantings of um uh koala corridor type trees and i 'd also like um a tree plan developed for box box flat road so the road that leads i 'm looking for a a a further dot point after the building envelopes one and that is that we ask for a tree plan development focusing on uh recommendations for koala friendly species and a tree plan for box flat road in consultation with council i can see the sense in the tree plant for box flat road i don 't know that you could enforce a recommended tree stick with that in there i said just a direction encouraging people to do so is that enforceable through the general manager as a condition of consent a condition encouraging people to do it is not a condition no okay all right but i see the value in the um roadside planting as a condition that could even uh bring that in you could actually part of the roadside planting could actually be uh a koala you know friendly trees whatever the correct term is so um that 's what i 'm looking for madam mayor um an additional uh uh an additional point related to uh a tree plant along box flat road if that includes also koala from this species um okay councillor mccarthy this is your recommendation and councillor kellum are you happy for that to be included as the third item um i personally don 't think so madame in respect that i 'm not against the tree planting but i think what we 're going to do is look at different aspects of trees along the road sometimes they might be needed to be individual cluster so i support the warrego lane one because it 's not a continuous through road but i think to just go and plant the warrigos style on a clear road isn 't um suffice so you 're not happy to support that as an additional recommendation no no it would have to then be an amendment councillor dhoni yes i 'm um i 'm happy for that and i 've had this conversation with council mccarthy i 'm happy for that uh tree plan to be varied i 'm not necessarily talking about an avenue of trees like warago lane because i agree with him it 's it 's a it 's a true road and it 's got different characteristics but i would like to see um the impetus on the developer to develop that tree plan even in line with what councilman kevin 's saying clusters of trees individual trees that is in fact what i 'm suggesting any response council mccarthy is this an alteration or is it going to have to be an amendment oh well let 's get a tree design from the um 's that if council callum 's happy with that if this goes on as a condition of consent though it it 's not a report coming back to council it 's a condition of consent that goes with the d.a yeah that 's that 's my problem of dealing with it at this level okay so i think what we 're hearing council dhoni is that you need to propose an amendment okay so if you would like to read out your amendment to sharon yes it would then be 0.3 that in consultation with council officers a suitable tree plan be developed for box black road we 'll stop um in particular with um forgive me getting a bit convoluted where possible um uh a koala friendly habitat in mind if we could have the amendment up whenever you 're ready when you 're ready sharon we 'll call for a second okay is that what you want to see there counselor danny well general manager sure um yes so that 's fairly close to that of me yes before you call this consent condition just calls for a 'm happy to adjust that tree plan development and implementation of a suitable treat plan tree plan and consultation with the general manager develop and implement a suitable tree plan and is that implementation at the cost of the developer i would believe so yes if it 's a conditional consent it would be and does that mean the continuous because i remember i recall our discussion about warrior lane and ensuring that this was this is what occurs okay councillor dhoni are you happy with how this looks uh at this point madam there yes just a just a point that i 'd like to raise madame if i could and um is counsellor is council considering that this plan is to be developed for the entirety of blocks flat road or for that area of box flat road where where um the r both sides of the road are actually subject to um but both sides of the road the full length of both sides of the road are actually subject to this application one sides are five one side and r1 and the other sides are one suggesting that we put an onerous burden on the developer to build a a huge avenue of trees down both sides i 'm just looking for a suitable tree plant you can it fits in with the environment and um and yes both sides of the road are subject to this application okay can i just ask before i before i call for a second i could i ask the general manager is this an enforceable and reasonable condition of consent um through the chair any condition that council wants to put on and they consider them reasonable is a reasonable condition my only suggestion would be that we add that the development implementation needs to be carried out prior to the issue of a subdivision certificate because that is the trigger to um [Music] to basically entrench this condition into it into a into an application thank you madam mayor if i can uh if i can counsel mckinley councilman kevin i haven 't got a second to get for this amendment i need to get one i can open it up for talking if you 're fine with some suggestions and i realize that but i i i 'm not understanding the the amendment in a number of ways but i 'm happy to wait if you want me to madam man i 'm happy i need to have a second out for this amendment if councillor dhoni is happy i think councillor callum also indicated and i can 't see him on the screen that he would second this amendment um we think that the addition he put in he suggested is that correct counselor that 's correct thank you so as he was a sec as he was a second into the original motion i don 't think he 's going you 're right you 're right sorry and i i would second it but i i can 't second it because i have problems with it okay okay counselor what are your problems uh well first of all i agree with the general manager that we need to put a time frame on it does the implementation mean watering and weed control of these trees forever more what 's the requirement for maintenance on this two is um whilst i have some sympathy for the second section of this um is it in the interests of this council to be i agree with the planting of species that are suited well koalas in appropriate locations but beside roads is normally not considered an appropriate location because of the likelihood that hit by vehicles which happens quite regularly so i would be suggesting that it 's not appropriate to put koala species beside the road i think we should be encouraging plantation lots of trees i know that we said we couldn 't encourage the plantation lots as originally proposed by council dhoni but i 'm just not sure beside the roads is the appropriate place because the last thing we want is koalas run over and that has happened that does happen in the uh in other areas and also because of the the distance between the roadway and the fence um it 's not really always appropriate to put natives in because experience suggests that you need three to five rows of natives to really make it tangible you know for natives to grow just put one here and one there and one there they 're just some observations i make before the amendment goes okay consideration okay councillor dhoni um i need to get this amendment set on certainly thank you madam mayor am i i don 't have a hello can i be heard you can we can hear you we 're just consuming i don 't know i think um i appreciate uh council on the government 's point um [Music] and that that is a risk one of the considerations of roadside verges that they are one of the main um areas of preservation of flora and fauna in our district these days because of the intense farming of the paddocks then sometimes the only sort of natural environment left is on the road verge i guess we might put up a koala sign or something could do it um and um yeah i you know three to five there 's lots of native trees in smaller numbers along that along the side of their roads um so i appreciate the points but i still think um they don 't it stands as it is health for danny i 'm just wondering about his time frame i appreciate very much council on the kibben 's issue i 'm happy to take some advice on how we can put this in a manageable uh time frame terminology okay i need counselor callum are you happy to second the third recommend recommendation the amendment as it sits at the moment counselor callum i think we can get around [Music] some of the issues by um perhaps using a term like uh planet with uh habitat and climate um appropriate species you wish the koala friendly habitat to stay there uh i i think that makes it difficult for for some people if we say climate and habitat appropriate species um that can cover all of those things it can cover whether we put uh exotics where we put natives what sort of natives that give some latitude but also some direction for people so you 're suggesting we take out to koala friendly habitat and put in climate appropriate species is that your suggestion to be clear climate and habitat species climate particular where possible climate and habitat appropriate species prior to the issue of the subdivision certificate are you happy with that counselor johnny to get your second down i certainly am madam thank you okay there 's a further discussion on this amendment councillors just need to tie up a few um surplus words in there okay that in consul consultation with the general manager develop and implement a suitable tree plan for the area along box flat road and in particular where and in particular where possible and take out in particular i think would be the way and where possible climate and habitat tree species prior to the issue of the subdivision certificate happy with that appropriate madam mayor if i could now i 'd like the opportunity just to try and get some um uh certainly finalization of this um can i could i suggest trees please for the entirety of box flat road not the area along oxford road because councillors have indicated it 's for both sides so it 's for the entirety of box flat road that would that would give both the developer was raised by councillor mckibben i think and i apologize if it wasn 't around how long is that proposed to be kept in play or like is it is it forever you can there is no provision to make a developer continuously do that right but what council could do is potentially after this thing has been implemented um developed and implemented the council could consider keeping a bond for a period of time to make sure that the the uh the tree plan is established and then after a certain period of time maybe 12 months but that bond is is provided back to the to the owner or to the developer and that gives some clarity and some some um certainly some um weight to the fact that the for the first 12 months the developer would have a responsibility over making sure that the the tree plan is established and after that 12 months the money goes back to the developer and council takes over ownership is that normal practice general manager um it certainly is when we come to building roads and doing that sort have responsibility for okay does that need to go into the recommendation or is this just a point of clarification from yourself the the question was asked i 'm answering the question madame uncertainty okay we have councillor dhoni and councillor kellum with this amendment is this how you guys want to see this councillor donai i need a final word here the um comments from the general manager take direction on that uh he has a fair bit of liens in consultation with the general manager develop and implement a suitable tree plan if the general manager feels that the appropriate way to do that is to take a bond ask for maintenance and return the bond at the end of the process then perhaps that is covered within that phraseology and we don 't need to uh change it anymore good counselor callum are you happy with that i am madam mayor are there any other comments from any other councillors on this mat on this amendment please councillor gibbons council gibbons hello you are highlighter yeah i just um can 't_''_6602.8 agree with this too well um sealed that road and made it wider than a normal country road we have a number of bends there where the road touches the fence on some sides and touches the fence on the others i like trees but they grow bigger and they spread out particularly the eucalyptus i just don 't know why we can 't make them plant the trees in on the subdivision just next to the fencing i just think it 's [Music] a backward step in a way if you was there and plant it right you may get away with some some of it because you 're going to have no room on some sides of your fence it 's not an avenue of trees i know i just think we 're not thinking of the long-term situation with the road you can 't drain it because you have trees in the road uh maintenance on the shoulders i 've just seen it happen when you plant the tree small it looks so good then when we see what we have with our own roads i just think that if this development should should be a screen or some trees planted within the subdivision along the boundary or 10 meters from or to five meters i 'm just not in favor as it is it 's all over the place for me thank you councillor any other council mccarthy gibbons i think a cluster of trees in certain spots would be far more suitable um in the uh recommendation it says the authority of boxlap road how does that impact on the orchard that 's down the other end here we are putting other trees there that might be suitable or could kill off the orchard i i don 't think that 's appropriate either thank you councillor how 's the mckechnie thank you madam mayor i um i just uh like to support councillor gibbons comments in council mccarthy 's i think they 're both very valid points and um we need to consider them we i i agree that we shouldn 't be planting uh large eucalypt species trees on on on the roadside verges i think on on the land holders side of the fence in clumps as a much other councils have outlined but also for safety reasons for vehicle traffic um you know we don 't we know what it 's like to try and swerve to miss an animal to you know your natural instinct is to do it even though the rules of the road say don 't do it but we know we all know the first instinct is to break and swerve to miss the animal to save the animals so i i can see um issues with both but i think we should be steering away from putting trees on roadside burgers especially all the way along that road i think much more suitable solution is to put them in clumps in the landholder side of the fence and just one other question um i thought the original motion was moved by council mccarthy in second and by councillor callum now we have an amendment moved by councillor dhoni and seconded by councillor kellen i 'm not sure if that is that right are we voting on the amendment now and ken we voting on the amendment the amendment council killing consecutive both manager yeah madame in this instance i would suspect that you would need a second second other than councillor kellogg thank you madam you seconded it you seconded it madam man me oh no i 'm sorry i didn 't i i think you did actually because when i raised the issue before and then it counselor donnie reyes raised it and i think you seconded it i 'm pretty sure i 'm pretty sure before i 'm pretty sure that i didn 't counsel mckinnon uh madam mayor i think what happened was that i said i want to get in before we got a second up and then the discussion went on and i think just so you may have just assumed that i seconded it which i didn 't so yeah okay i 've taken the advice from the general manager counsellors that counselor kellum is unable to second the amendment is there a second another sector for the amendment now we 've had all the discussion is there a seconder for the amendment there 's no second of the amendment lapses and we go back to back up on the screen please sharon because we 're getting very lost here madam mayor the the original motion had a an addition to additional point yeah councillor mccarthy and councilman endorsed prior to the need for an amendment and that 's the one i 'm talking about which is the reason why you didn 't need a foreshadowed motion that 's right could you take the screen up a bit sharon just a tiny bit for a moment thank you okay councillors we are back to the original motion with the additional dot points or the dictionary recommendation dot point that was proposed by council mccarthy and seconded by councillor kellum do we have any further discussion on the recommendation that you can see on the screen so we do counselor mccarthy yes matt madame just a clarification on number four dot point um this development 's been with us for six months in that time we haven 't had this technical service department and heritage advisor have a look at this i believe that we have it 's in the report so why is that condition in through the chair just for clarification these are reasons for the approval not conditions of consent okay thank you any other comments here counsellors counselor downey counselor hello thank you madam mayor um that was my next question uh these are reasons um because personally i don 't agree with those dot points and i wonder whether um meeting all elements of a development control plan which you know we haven 't applied that to development applications for building on those blocks yet um i 'm not sure about flora and fauna we 've discussed heritage and we 've made an adjustment social environment and economic do we need those statements in there madam mayor through you to the general manager [Music] i thought so thank you thank you council johnny councillor callum i have one further observation maya and that is that recently we had a discussion with a an applicant for a developed the da down in uh wiseman 's creek and we discovered of course that um all grassland is now considered fire prone um and that 's not mentioned uh in this um d.a and the i questioned this myself the fire i think the fire plan is in keeping with the latest rfs requirements if you could confirm general manager through the chair that 's correct but what you 'll also note is that these are substantially large allotments where manicured grasses could be implemented to minimize bushfire issues that aren 't necessarily consistent with the with the development that 's been raised madam mayor i based my comment on uh page 73 paragraph 1.9 which says no proposed lock and sub bushfire prone and certainly at the moment they are bushfire prone because they 're grassland to the general manager yeah yeah thank you madam mayor through the chair yes that 's correct they 're not bushfire prone but they are subject to the provisions of planning for bushfire protection in accordance with the new amendments in 2020 so once again grassland is one of those categories that is considered bushfire prone and appropriate mechanisms need to be put in place should a development application be lodged that assessed that each of our assessment will need to consider thank you anything any other comments sits councillor mckibben um thank you madam mayor um i know that the amendment proposed by councillor dhoni uh was not seconded however i personally don 't have a problem with a tree policy as long as it 's cognizant of the issues that uh council gibbons and mckechnie and mccarthy raised um and the general managed to be delegated to look at that and and that the suggestion by the general manager that a bond be put in place i suggest for two years for maintenance of the of the of the trees um i thought was a suitable appropriate suggestion um uh i suppose i would be suggesting that in appropriate places similarly to what we 've requested well what we 're looking at at borrogo lane that um that trees be put in and i take council mckenna 's point maybe not uh not natives and they also put in take cognizance of council gibbons points if not not near any drainage areas and not where the width of the um the distance the verge between the road edge and the fence is not sufficient to have for councillors for such an amendment at this stage maybe i should ask back to councillor dhoni whether he would think that was appropriate through you madam man i 'm wondering if it 's my place to comment on it madam mayor i mean obviously i support the essence of what council mckibben 's saying uh i thought we were putting a fair bit of flexibility into that we uh you know we 're not talking about an avenue when we 're talking about a range of things um and i think i think developing getting developers to put into trade plans is uh is an improvement in our um in our planning process can i say that the amendment has been defeated and another amendment cannot be bought uh of the same um theme is that 's what you 're getting is that 's where we 're going here i apply council mccarthy and then i 'm going to put this to the vote just just to comment madam mayor you you look at the development in warrego lane and you look outside the council verge into the yards those allotments by the residents it 's phenomenal and i i don 't think we have to really concern ourselves too much because these people are planting the trees that they want in their yard and the amount of trees that are in these yards are phenomenal down there in the warriga lane and and they 're not in the council verge anyway that 's just a comment thank you council mccarthy i 'm now going to put the recommendation counselors i will ask sharon once again to put it up on the screen so we 're all clear on what we 're voting on after prolonged discussion okay counsellors i 'm going to now put that recommendation as you read it all in favor one two three four five six six against councillor dhoni the recommendations carried counsellors thank you man uh just with your forbearance um i just want it clearly understood that uh my voting against this is of course registered it 's not against the subdivision because there 's no legal basis to vote against it but uh i just feel we my vote is against can continue to do better thank you madame thank you council danny okay counsellors we 're now up to page 95 item 1303 funding assistance for christmas themed activities the recommendation is that council allocate five thousand dollars from the 2020 21 oberon christmas celebrations budget to the funding assistance for christmas themed activities project do i have a mover for this councillors please no mover counselor kellum thank you and council adoni thank you councillor callum do you wish to speak to this recommendation yes madam mayor um this was uh a decision of the community services meeting and originated there and been put together by the community services director it is a reasonable way of doing business it is actually no different from our in essence from our 355 committees and the 356 donations and it it allows for the creativity of our citizens to get some assistance to decorate our streets and i think it 's a it 's a it 's a reasonable way of doing business uh it 's not like the money is being handed out with no controls um like all money we um in some way and i think we 'll probably have a pretty good response to this and it 'll be a pretty decent way of satisfying our requirements for christmas decorations in town thank you council council danny do you wish to speak to this um surely all i can say is ba humbug madam mayor for those who are familiar with um there is some pieces of christmas literature so humbug i thoroughly supported thank you any other comments sonic councillors on this item put the recommendation all in favor carried councilman kim and carried unanimously thank you page 96 councillors item 1304 participate in a regional contract for the supply and delivery of bitumen emulsion the recommendation is that council agreed to participate in a regional contract for the supply and delivery of bitumen emulsion and provide central new south wales joint organization with advice accordingly can i have a mover please council mckibben and council mccarthy thank you wish to speak to this council mckibben thank you madam mayor the paper speaks for itself obviously we obtain cost advantages in participating in this significant cost savings relatively big user of uh bitumen so i 'd um i 'd commend this recommendation thank you councillor councilman participate thank you straightforward madame thank you are the comments counsellors any questions put the recommendation all in favor encourage unanimously thank you page 99 item 1305 2019-20 unaudited financial statements there 's a recommendation in two parts councillors that council accept the 2019-20 unaudited financial statements in accordance with section 413 bracket 3 the annual financial report is in accordance with the local government act 1993 as amended and the regulations made there under the australian accounting standards and professional pronouncements and the local government code of accounting practice and financial reporting presents fairly the council 's operating result and financial position for the year and accords with council 's accounting and other records and council is not aware of any matter that would render this report false or misleading in any way part two delegate the mayor deputy mayor general manager and the corporate services director to sign the 2019-20 unaudited financial statements do i have a mover please councillor mckibben thank you do i have a secondary you council mckibben um thanks thank you madam mayor uh it 's interesting to see the effects that the changes and accounting standards have had especially in that grants not utilized are obviously uh treated differently and can 't be um treated as they have been previously in materials and contracts and similarly that our lease liabilities are treated separately under the new accounting standards so it does make some difference to our accounts the interesting fact is that i i seem to recall that we were anticipating a loss this year but we 've actually made a slight profit uh rather than a loss so that 's good albeit that it is um uh it is it and it is a profit um obviously our cash and investments standing at um 17.6 million is an increase on last year so that 's good from an operating perspective and from our asset perspective so i would uh move the two recommendations uh proposed for this item madam ma 'am thank you councilman kevin councillor keller thank you thank you madam mayor i uh endorse wholeheartedly councilman kevin 's words and i course thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors any questions counselor donate counsel johnny i think thank you madam i was just i 'm using myself uh just a couple of quick questions if i may uh in the attachments on page 85 84 actually 8-4 i 'm just um looking at the year-to-year change in employee leave entitlements and workers compensation insurance am i reading that those two um employee leave entitlements went from you know negative 32 to positive 68 and compensation insurance went from 172 to two through three thousand is that correct am i reading that correctly through the direct term through the chair um yes uh councillor johnny the leave um entitlements did increase uh this financial year i think we need to remember that for almost most of the second half of the financial year we were in covert situation and not many staff took leave at that point in time so there was a substantial increase in entitlement um and the workers compensation insurance did increase as expected this will this is part of ongoing claims um leftover from the in the next couple of years okay um and also there 's quite a bit of conversation elsewhere in the reports talking about water and sewerage um one and one five eight one five nine of your attachment and i just wouldn 't see clarity because i think it bears on other considerations we 're making that the um in the water account there is a am i reading that right as a 6.2 million dollar reserve and in the sewage account of 7.4 million reserve uh yes that is correct and also just not in these reports but um can staff refresh my memory of the increases in the water and the sewage account in recent years did we have a three-year period where we went 10 per year or what actually was that rate of increase over a period of time aside from our special rate variation there was a big jump in our water charges prior to the special rate variation council did allocate a 10 increase over two years but that was quite some time ago approximately five years ago um before the special rate variation i guess we 've got a different perspective over five years uh five years ago that those that was a 20 increase over two years that is great that is correct yes thank you madame thank you councillor are there other comments councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation in two parts all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 102 item 1306 new south wales safer roads program 202021 safety barrier tender t20209 the recommendation is that council nominate the open open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 166a of the local government regulation 2005 for the purchase and installation of new safety barrier at several locations on the abercrombie road t20185 i will just note counselors that in the comment in the second paragraph down as the three that should read three hundred and fifty thousand not three million five hundred thousand can i have someone to move the recommendation please council mccarthy and councillor callum thank you councillor mccarthy uh pretty happy with the report soon went back to um 350 000 not the 3 million thank you thank you council kellum uh very cabin thank you man the mayor um just a couple of questions that i made obviously we use a lot of guardrail material in the works we do why aren 't we does the jo not purchase guardrail in bulks or have a contract for it so that we would get the benefit of that because it would have as with the bitumen we 've considered a few minutes ago i would have thought this would be a major expense for all councils the material side of it to the director place yeah through the chair certainly uh don 't disagree with your statement there councillor mcgibbon uh but the jo does not uh presently have a guard rail a tendering or contract i would imagine a lot of councils do use guardrail there are different types of guard rail certainly that are probably utilized by the varying councils specific to our needs and this particular one in in this instance there is is a one-off uh expenditure that certainly exceeds we 're expected to see the 250 000 mark again by bounded by our policy we are we are one financial year probably exceed you know 150 000 in any case a game but something that i could raise from a ja perspective in terms of tendering opportunities for guard rail into the future um thank you uh technical service director i i would uh encourage um encourage that because i would have thought that uh there would have especially if um if they can standardize the guard rail types etc with that that there would be benefits in the jo doing something in this regard that might that completes my comment madame thank you thank you council council mccarthy madam mayor from our past experience when council was doing the work we were getting twice as much rail done by suitable qualified contractors because he was his purchase power was that much greater than councils because he was doing the work all the time so that might lay some of the uh fears that council mcgivern has but that 's that 's how it come about that the purchase power from this con one of the contractors we engaged we were doing twice as much as the work any other comments on this one councillors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carry carriage unanimously thank you we have a late report counsellor items counselors um item 1307 if you all have your late reports bushfire community recovery and resilience fund phase 2 funding allocation there 's a recommendation there that council allocate 187 500 which is 75 of the stream one funding to the oberon mountain bike trail project which is a council-led tourism-based project two that council allocate the required 62 500 which is 25 percent of stream one funding to small-scale community projects from the attached list three that staff apply for stream two can i have someone to move that recommendation please councilman kevin thank you is there a second applies councillor kellum okay councilman thank you very much thank you madam mayor um noting the time frames we have to work within within in relation to this funding and the suggested uh proposed uh list which which relates to that is the second part of the recommendation i think what is proposed is actually reasonable noting that the the effect that the industry and noting also that um mountain bike tracks have been a great enticement for people to come and use them and that we obviously in oberon if there 's one thing we have it is the terrain for good mountain bike tracks so i i would commend this recommendation i think in the circumstances what is proposed is absolutely reasonable thank you can i just go to the general manager before i go to counselor kellum with the chart that 's on page six um of pro listed projects has there been any update to that i know that a lot of projects have been coming in um because of the short time frame um late yeah thank you madam mayor the reason why this is a late report is for exactly that reason there was a um the the funding opportunities only just arose and we need to have an allocation provided we 've got one additional um application and that is for the from the christian life center and it 's for an after-school youth program is there a value on that general manager um at this and is it shop already is it project ready um given that given what it is it would be determined that it would be shovel ready subject to the purchase of a number of things okay also column would you want to comment on this item before i throw it out throw it open the mountain bike aspect of it and i can see we 've got some a little bit of work to do this evening on uh allocating the remaining 62 500. okay i 've got i have personally i 've gone through this list and it 's obvious that with the money available for the community grants that they all can 't_''_8584.08 be satisfied my thought was and i 'm throwing it that there for discussion that with phase two coming up and um timeline no november for the projects to be submitted and given that they are for projects over twenty thousand dollars it would be my suggestion that any project in the list in this list over twenty thousand dollars be considered in the phase two uh section of this grant i think we should frame [Music] but i 'm happy to throw this out there for discussion counsellors does anybody have a view on this counselor gibbons yeah talking about shovel ready projects and the phase two coming up but that would be the opportunity again for the acoustics at the black springs hall this one seemed too small for that even though we were going to get something up for heating in the hall you know the shovel ready that particular project and we may never get the grand for it i think it should be included in phase two okay it 's is it eastern here thank you counselor any other comments counsellors counselor callum and mayor i think your suggestion might make it uh much simpler had a chance to do the aristic but i think that deferring the the anything 20 000 and over to the second stream is probably um makes it reasonably straightforward for that list there [Music] do we have a spreadsheet anywhere in operation at the moment what 's what 's the total mark those two eliminated um i get the ones that aren 't uh couple of 20 or three i think three that are over 20 000. does the director of corporate services have a spreadsheet with all these in it so they easily add it up through the chair no there is no spreadsheet this was put through by the grants officer but i 'm just quickly doing calculation now could i suggest that the barricade community has also suggested a notice board at the end of the park near the carpet through the chair there 's already no sport available for at the end of the car park right through the chair i 've just done some calculations and if you did exactly what you 've requested there is seven one thousand and forty five dollars within that within those project cost estimates given that the resurfacing of one tennis of one netball court at ten thousand dollars has no is not project ready if you minus that it leaves you with 65 045 which is 2 000 over the minimum and that doesn 't that also excludes the two tbcs yes um yes it does well that doesn 't preclude them tbcs being included in stage two and at this point in time we 're looking for a number of applications the smaller ones to be included in that second phase yeah council mckibben uh through you madam mayor if i can ask the general manager whether he got a report from on the borrower hall today i can confirm that i did not right because i 'm i 'm not sure where that that was in relation to the original amount allocated for the burranka hall there was meant to be a report provided to indicate where it was up to but once again stage two is available it closes it may not be over 20 000. that doesn 't matter could you explain that please because in the criteria the second phase are 20 000 to a much larger amount can you group them together it doesn 't preclude an organization coming with a number of things in the one location to get it over that phone okay okay yep okay council let 's counsel donny there we go um it 's exactly the same question except change the late report on the um outdoor cinema event proposal today any info okay thank you nothing 's come to me now um i 'll i will say though is our grants officer is currently on leave but that day should filter through to the right person and it hasn 't come through us okay okay counselors is there any other input here so um council mccarthy how much are we over budget at the moment um it 's approximately two thousand dollars which could probably be handled if council were of mine to accept those 62 500 is the minimum spend on community grants if there 's there is no upper limit okay councillors i will put a recommendation for item two item two that we allocate funding to projects under twenty five thousand under twenty thousand dollars that are shovel ready as per the list compiled by the grants officer if i can get a seconder for that council mckibben you seconding that or wish to speak i 'm prepared to second that the only suggestion is that i think we need to say shovel ready and that have shovel ready with the cost estimate okay well if on that basis i 'm prepared to second thank you very much so i 've got a move around a second r for item two is there any further discussion on that councillors council no council kellum you wish to speak yes i do uh does that then naturally change the allocation of 187 500 to 185 500 in item one you 're the general manager it would sorry can you unmute yes it would okay 185 000 what was the other what was the bigger council i haven 't got a calculator i think okay so counselor kevin and counselor callum this was your recommendation so how that will read now is that council allocate 185 500 which is 75 would have to say approximately wouldn 't it of the stream one funding uh yes we just leave the 75 percent out 185 500 when one funding yep that 's one whatever the figure is 60 thousand and forty five dollars was that it yeah from uh streamlined funding again get rid of the witches 25 percent take out that you 've got that can we see that up on the screen before we put it to the boat please madame air through the chair the numbers will be 84 955 hundred and eighty four thousand you mean 955 and 65 045 that would make up the the total amount total yes okay so this is an amendment that was moved by myself and seconded by council mckibben you happy with that council mckebern the way that looks the amendment confirmed i i confirm that it 's fine my only question is where did we get the costing for the mountain bike trail project and are we certain that we can do it for this smaller amount through the general manager through the chair i am sure that given the very small it wouldn 't change the project substantially thank you thank you madame i 'm happy with the amendment thank you councillor kevin mckibben i 'm going to put the amendment councillors all in favor that 's carried unanimously the amendment now becomes the motion all in favor of the motion in three parts thank you councillors it 's 104 report item 1401 monthly activity report general manager i will just say councillors that after we 've dealt with this report we will be taking a five-minute break um so the recommendation here is that the report item 1401 is received as information can i have someone to move that way please councillor gibbons thank you and councillor callum thank you councillor gibbons you wish to speak to this [Music] and support the recommendation thank you councillor councillor callum thank you madam mayor i 'm happy with the uh report from general management activities and i look forward to the uh um the consolidated report of uh um resolutions at the end thank you council any other comments on this one council 's place council mccarthy um are our staff aware of our policies especially with the grading of ramps on public roads general manager through the chair as part of our recruitment our ongoing practices policies are provided to staff constantly so we 're well aware that we don 't grade within six metres of a ramp um i can defer to the technical services director yeah through again council mccarthy depending on i suppose the nature of the repair on the road uh castle staff can 't leave uh certainly erode in disrepair either but uh do certainly take the point about um grading up to cattle ramps and um uh i suppose the uh the potential to push material within the uh the ramps themselves so staff are quite well aware of some particular aspect i i thought a gateway was damaged that was all in grading too close to the um ramp that was all uh yep through the chair i 'm not aware uh of of such puns not to say that there isn 't uh but i 'll take that on notice and i 'll endeavor to find a bit more information on that one thank you now the comments on the monthly activity report general manager i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you we will now take a five minute break councillors it 's ten past eight we will resume at 8 15. the corporate certainty councils were on page 110 item 1402 monthly activity report planning received as information can i have someone to move that way please council mccarthy and councillor donai thank you council mccarthy mr speaker it 's pretty straightforward um just after our informal briefing with the independent living units on page 110 um the nine carports the responsibility to erect them is with the builder isn 't it um that 's to the director of corporate services um through the chair i could probably answer that and the answer is no but we 're looking at for a contractor to appropriately construct those nine carports is my understanding okay i i was led to believe it was a part of the contract for the units okay credit council mccarthy yes thank you thank you councillor johnny thank you madam may um um just on page 110 the um before i comment i asked the question about the planning assets um i do think as i said in the earlier item about the subdivision of o 'connell i think our staff have done a um you know a much improved and exhaustive job that i 'd like the general manager to pass thought it was um uh a good document they put forward um having said that although i didn 't always agree with all of them i still thought it was a good document um what what hope have we got in transition of getting a town planner we had a hard enough time getting the last one what are we going to do in the meantime mr general manager through the chair currently you 're looking at the planning director who is trying to keep a ship pointed in the right direction trying some assistance at this point in time it 's been very difficult to try and find someone to come for a short period of time however in saying that um to recruit the application um notification the advertising has now been completed and we should be looking to progress my interviews in the very near future are they interviews for interim or for permanent they are interviews for the permanent position um and do we have a tap of consultants we can use that fantastic if you don 't know beautiful thank you thank you councilor is 'm i 'm i 'm having a little trouble hearing the general manager i don 't know other people are um on this item madam mayor um the last two meetings in august and september i 've asked for a breakdown of where we are schedule wise and cost wise against the original budget and the original schedule that was raised in the august meeting and then september meeting i raised it again and i was assured we would get it for this meeting and i 'd ask for it in august and i was insured in september the general manager will remember that he said yes that 's in accordance with our new contract management policy and it will be provided in the october meeting it 's not here so on that basis i don 't believe that i can accept this report and i will be voting against it thank you councillor did you wish to respond general manager um through the chair totally agree with trying to provide a breakdown for the councils the project 's not yet completed i mean we 're trying we 're looking a similar type project additional reports will be provided through the grants report um i note the concerns from the counsellor thank you any other comments here councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor six against thank you the recommendation is carried page 115 item 1403 monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please councilman mckechnie thank you and councillor mccarthy thank you councillor mckechnie do you wish to comment on the report uh thank you madam man yes fairly thorough report and um it 's noted that this time of the year the outdoor staff particularly busy with parks and gardens and road repairs from storm damage and it 's a lot of good feedback on the removal of vegetation from the roadsides and also the grading in the outer areas around around some of our um southwestern areas jerula and shooters heal out the way arc stone so a lot of good comments from that i think um the staff seem to be doing a a good job under trying of the lga certainly showing the benefit of it so i have no no problem in in recommending this report accepted thank you councillor council mccarthy yeah here 's a fine report madam mayor is there any anticipation when the cardwood road will be sealed and the other part of jenkin other part of the road out of ginkin to the drag top yeah thanks madam mayor uh yes certainly we had some plans for uh our contractor fulton hogan to come [Music] this wednesday uh well into thursday seem to be having a bit of a technical issue with the technical services director dude sorry uh technical services director could you repeat that you blacked out you blanked out oh sorry yeah so uh yeah look at the the first uh wrote off uh on the list is is cardwood road and hopefully if the weather holds out we 'll be able to start that on thursday morning with fulton hogan when they arrive on site okay thank you thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you the recommendation is there that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please is it remover please councillor dhoni thank you and councilman kevin thank you councillor dhoni wish to speak to this report forgive me i 've got to tell you um i need to commend it on the um variety of uh community activities that have highlights i think that um some of these are really terrific and i commend the um the division on its um uh participation in the community thank you madam mick thank you council downey councilman [Music] thank you madam mayor thank you madame um no the report is particularly extensive obviously continues to show us where we are with rate payments um and obviously interesting to see what 's happening in the microsoft 365 world with some artificial intelligence etc and also we obviously interested to see what 's happening with the ams group with the three contenders for um providing that um one of them being the current provider civica and uh another two so we all wait with baited breath to see where we get to see that the library is continuing to offer a whole lot a lot of services and that coffees have moved on are moving ahead with looking at what the community wants for the new community hub project on that basis i 'm very pleased to second the recommendation that this uh this report be taken as read thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors council mccarthy with the right categories in the outstanding balance isn 't it odd to have 40 percent of the residential rates still outstanding this is not a true indication is it on page 121 um through the mayor the um remembering that the rates are a month behind this year they only went out a month later so it 's not a true picture the true picture won 't come until the probably the december meeting for the first half of this year so that 's not an outstanding rate from last year is it no it 's in total it includes this end last year okay thank you the other comments here councillors i 'm going to put the recommendation statement of investments the recommendation is that council received the report item as information can i have a mover please can i have a mover please counsellors councillor dhoni and council mckibben thank you council downey do you wish to speak to this recommendation oh um i think um it 's always good to see the solid position of our um our investments and um and i wish us in the economy all well into the future thank you thank you council danny cousins uh no matter well i think the report speaks for itself so i 'm happy to second second the recommendation thank you any other comments counsellors are putting the recommendation all in favor code unanimously thank you page 129 item 1406 grants monthly update recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please council mckibben and a secondary please counselor kellum thank you councilman kevin do you wish to speak to the report um thank you madam mayor this is a a detailed report and has given us a very good synopsis of where we are with our grants of them which we 've currently been talking about and also the stream too which we talked about um before the break um also interesting is the um um is the breakdown on the oberon fitness center project and i think there 's a variance of how i read it it 's 331 against the original budgeted amount plus approved variations and additional funding obtained for fit out of the center etc so i think that 's a good result um and i think the total contribution the council and the general manager will correct me that means is 25 331 for this project 's capital cost if i 'm not rolled um which is which is great for the facility that we have um and we can only hope that projects in the future go this well um i also think that um i think we took this a reference to the round five um building better regions from round five um the 200 million that 's been set aside into 2021 um and that 's expected to open in november 2020 um and that 's what i think 20 000 and 10 million so madame air i commend the report um and it 's set out uh as always very easy to agree um just to clarify council mckibben what we were talking about before with the minimum being 20 000 that 's the second phase of the community resilience fund grant the bushfire one okay so the not the the grant on page the the building better regions fund round five 's a further one that we can apply for yes it is thank you counselor counselor kellum nothing further to add thank you councillor any other comments on this one councillors put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 134 1407 water usage drought assistance the recommendation is that report item is received as information and be noted can i have a mover please counselor gibbons thank you and council mccarthy councillor gibbons do you wish to speak to the recommendation yep you are happy with the recommendation great to see that we got 32 in the damn at the moment so it 's still probably creeping up yeah mccarthy no no happy see a um a pelicon being filled up today over at the uh water being distributed but uh anyway happy with the report thank you thank you council any other comments on this one councillors put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 135 item 1408 water and sewer plant report the recommendation is that the report be received as information a mover please counselors counselor donai thank you a second to please counselor kellum thank you do you wish to speak to the report counselor danny we need to unmute uh forgive me um i have a question i 'm not sure whether we can deal with it um in my reading of the dirty water issues relating to you know the water plant um there was a variety of reasons given the questions from the public seem to suggest that there was a totally different set of reasons as to why we had the dirty water problem now i 'm looking for assistance here the reasons given in my earlier reading were you know um low levels and you know wind direction and turbulence and the public seem to say that you know our pumps were no good and the whole thing went diddly scott um can i get some clarification on from you know what exactly was the source of the dirty water problem through the general manager exercises director will adequately explain i 'm sure technical service director sorry i couldn 't hear that uh yeah thanks madam mayor uh yeah certainly a combination of uh issues and previous reports uh there was a reference to a potassium permanganate pump that had a big minor malfunction very short one certainly didn 't attribute to uh the dirty water but over time certainly we have had mains replacements around town there was one stage that it did create a uh you know when they connected a a new pipeline to the existing did stir the the existing mains up um that 's one instance but certainly with seasonal change the dam and the dam being so low the dam does still have what they call a turnover which does unfortunately have metals draw up from the bottom of the dam water new south wales the the water take off and delivery to our water treatment plant but again with the dam levels being so low uh and again you can have certainly issues with inflow from rain events and alike but the metals are the main issues with the dam being as low as they are and again today we 've had uh indications of um high manganese coming from water new south wales from the dam into our water treatment plant where as rural water so certainly the analysis from our geyser in treating that water is underway so we don 't uh again we don 't anticipate any further issues uh over time there can be interlining build up within pipes that is a regular systematic main ongoing maintenance thing for all councils or water authorities uh and that 's by by means of flushing mains but we have tried to reserve uh that in in the recent times of the dam levels being so low and trying to uh i suppose uh conserve water as much as we can but unfortunately we may be faced with uh ongoing program of having than we we would anticipate so um they 're some of the issues or key issues that have resulted in some of the dirty water off recent thank you technical services director councillor dani madam and so thank you um director um and so with the the continued need to flush the pipe system um how much how much of that was the result of hardware issues i mean i realized it 's a mixture of things but the questions from the public seem to zero in on hardware issues and manpower issues through the chair yes certainly not attributed from um i suppose unqualified plant operators certainly our rest assured our plant operators are qualified and you know these issues are gained around low dam levels um and you know elevated middle levels such as magnesium iron and those types of things that are found in certainly dams have attributed to you know these issues we are working closely with the department of primary industry and environment in relation to you know ongoing monitoring of water quality and rest assured that uh certainly meeting the australian drinking water guidelines the plant it 's just really a constant uh day-to-day monitoring of uh you know what water we are receiving from the dam and uh and treating it accordingly thank you very much thank you thank you dr callum did you wish to comment on the report uh no familiar i 'm quite happy with it thank you councilman thank you madame um whilst i know that it 's pleasing to see that the dam is 32 full i 'm very concerned that it is only 32 full with the amount of rain that has occurred over the last uh let 's say seven or eight months and um it seems to me that we have a long-term problem in that our dam is not going to meet the requirements of oberon and the other requirements of sydney water that they demand of it and that can be for a number of reasons into the proven fact that when forests are planted around areas to which water catchment areas for dams the runoff is significantly reduced so i 'm suggesting that oberon that i and i think that the proposal 's a it 's it 's a good start is not the ultimate solution and maybe oberon has to look at a new dam as well as the current there because the area has had a considerable amount of rain this year but the run-off is not sufficient to meet our damn record our requirements and it 's going to be interesting to see where we are in january february 2021 noting that we are still continuing uh still expecting that in this la nina we will have um greater rainfall certainly than the last two years but the issue is we 've only filled this down to 32 do we have to start strategically looking at having another additional dam especially while well in the current situation where we have governments who really have not built a major dam for the last 20 years or 50 years i think it is 50 years are now actually interested in looking at dams i just asked that strategically and put that on the table because we are not going to be able to cope with a significantly greater population if we of the year with higher than expected rainfall thank you councillor mckibben i will state that since we have been speaking with various authorities and the minister water new south wales who own our water and our dam are looking at various options um they are already starting to think about that and we just have to keep lobbying and keep the pressure up to make sure it stays up on the on their agenda but they are looking at several options any other comments here counsellors council um when does the ceiling are these upgraded mains that have been repaired how long from when the mains are completed do we seal the road again like over near the high school high traffic area uh through the chair certainly something we monitor councillor mccarthy and uh as the trenches uh do subside um it 's no use in sealing them straight away they need to be topped and then in due course will be sealed so it 's not something that we do straight after laying pipes given the subsides issues so so we don 't compact the fill uh is done uh but unfortunately look again it 's a bit of a time waiting game with the trenches do again subside so it would be just if we seal them now we 'd be coming back and actually trying to top them again with bitumen which um seems pointless and and i suppose cost prohibitive so we uh we let them subside a little bit and then top them before we sell them so what 's what 's the time frame uh that 's a particular section was done during the school holidays uh given uh was the most appropriate time uh with school closure so uh look probably within the next two weeks i would imagine we 'll resource that to occur okay thank you and council council gibbon yes lady me just uh uh continuing on what councilman kevin was saying i heard on the wireless only this week that uh the lithgow pipeline from the fish river had a blow out and they 've lost a lot of water there i really think lithgow should be thinking about the seriousness of the water situation as well and uh the water goes straight from there damn down to lithgow and talking about dams uh there 's certainly the infrastructure is at uh the duckworth we 're in good place for them but we just got a from a joint organization do the lithgow people participate in that no they 're in a different organisation right and bear in mind two councillor givens that as the dam level falls or so does the allocation to lisco and the other licence holders that 's right thank you councillor any other comments here councillors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 138 1409. monthly update status of council resolutions the recommendation is that the report item 1409 is received as information can i have somebody to move this place counselors council mccarthy and a second to please council mckechnie thank you council mccarthy do you wish to speak to this recommendation yeah matter it 's pretty straightforward um just to query the general manager um should the um park to a um town block be in gwener avenue be a part of this system should be should it be noted in this system are you saying that something 's missing from it counselors at your point well well i understand that the block of lambda to playground is to be converted into a residential block and it 's been going for a long time but it 's not on this list of an action should it be on this action list to the general manager the chair it was part of the rezone process that we went through when we looked at our reserves and my understanding is that 's been resolved so i 'm more than happy to take that up and try and see where it sits okay thank you thank you councillor council mccachney do you wish to speak to the uh madame thank you i 'm i 'm happy to second the nation it 's certainly an improvement in a lot easier way to uh look at the progress and and outstanding actions on resolutions so yeah but i have no no question on the resolutions thank you councilman any other comments here councillors i 'm going to put the just ask can i just ask through you to the general manager whether the uh application to the western joint regional planning panel on page 143 in relation to the new sports complex uh is going to proceed and be lodged by the end of this month through through the chair we 're just waiting for our partners to be in borgs to finalize those reports that we we asked for um i 'm keen to see it lodged by them um however i have a meeting with borgs next week and i 'll discuss where that is up to thank you madam thank you councillor another i 'll put the recommendation counselors all in favor unanimous thank you [Applause] page 153 item 14 10. dirty water report the recommendation is that the report item 1410 is received as information can i have a mover please councilman mckechnie thank you anna seconder councillor caleb thank you council mckechnie do you wish to speak to this report just thinking about it there um i think we 've discussed it in previous items tonight um this is pretty much a recap of questions and uh yeah good good report for information and uh pleasing to note that we 're supplying uh drinking water um that complies with the australian drinking water guidelines and the uh issue might be ongoing but uh it 's certainly decreased and uh i think people are uh happy that there 's been some um positive actions and uh some swift actions to rectify the problem or to to bring the problem down to a manageable level so yeah i 'm happy to accept the report thank you council mccackney councillor callum do you wish to speak to the report yes i yes i do um i know that the water treatment plant operated as it was supposed to operate and that 's good um but the the technical service director also notes that um it 's absolutely necessary to enable the mains to be flushed of all sediments that will build up over the past few years flushing the mains is a normal maintenance practice which is usually carried out annually can the technical service directors tell me when the last time those mains were flushed uh been flushed for for some time again within my i suppose of the water reports that i put to council uh certainly we haven 't experienced uh i suppose dam levels uh this low for quite some time uh however as i say with the depleting dam levels uh we have sort of backed off look it wouldn 't it probably going back from the records that i have around about probably 2014 i think was the last time uh that that was done um and it is substantial substantially sometime uh in between obviously now and uh 2014 no doubt but again certainly we haven 't had uh detection of certainly metal levels uh at this high so um or all dirty water complaints to to that end so was there any risk assessment done on the fact that we hadn 't flushed the mains for six years when it 's when it 's meant to be an annual job and it should be regular to use your words regular systematic and ongoing again probably to the extent that we have flushed in this time um yeah look by have been opened um and dirty water as dirty water does sometimes reticulate through systems has been flushed but again the need to strip them out like we have with the high metal levels hasn 't been done uh because it hasn 't been an instance but that has required us to uh to do it to this extent so again uh we uh we are going to be proactive in that area and certainly have instigated a a program now to um really keep a bit more of an eye on that your regular systematic and online program of doing annual maintenance by flushing the mains was not undertaken for five to six years uh again look i i don 't uh have an account over or records to uh to to to indicate uh to this extent as i say uh of what we 've done here at recent sorry if you just let me finish five years uh well as i say the last uh time i recall was back in 2014 again that 's not to say that hydrants haven 't been opened and mains have not that council hasn 't been proactive in this space and uh you know opened up mains but again the stripping of mains to the extent that we 've had to do this time hasn 't been done for some time and again it 's it 's something that i will be looking at uh you know more systematically uh you know over the over the coming years uh madam mayor uh through you i 'd ask the general manager to supply the councillors with evidence of when the last time the water mains was systematically um and regularly flushed and also what is the planned maintenance routine for our reticulated water system in terms of flushing the mains because it would appear that there has been no systematic regular and ongoing process of maintaining our water mains for up to six years and when something is important as fresh water that is not acceptable at all i 'm more than happy to provide a report back to council um outlining those things i must admit as the technical service director has indicated is that it 's not that they but you don 't when you return to it you won 't know again through the cheek what council will what i 'll get the tech services director to also do is to provide council with an overview on the the pretty substantial um testing regime they go through and what processes they go to look at water and water quality um so we give an overall understanding about about why this is more than happy to take that on board and report back i 'm very well aware of the testing regime that is done but when sediments build up in pipes you won 't discover that by testing you discover it by flushing and if there is meant to be an annual routine which is regular systematic and ongoing they should be flushed yearly and if not there should be a risk assessment as to what the effect on our potential effect now water supply is thank you councillor the general manager has indicated he will bring back a report any other question thank you any other questions or queries here councillors i 'm going to put the 155 councillors urgent business there is no urgent business this evening 16 closed session and confidential reports um i will now go to the general manager who has a submission before we move into council closed council yeah thank you madam mayor um i 'll just as i um flagged earlier in the night there was a a another part to um mr draham 's [Music] letter to council for for their consideration it 's not necessarily

claimant ought to be or to stay confidential however the underlying root cause of hardship and damage are not confidential matters for closed session please address potential further damages claims as part of 1410 together with 0.3 above i 'll provide an answer to that by saying that it is up to count it is up to the general manager to provide evidence as to why why matters should be considered in confidential or enclosed this matter deals with personal claims and are private to those individuals and fall under 10 a 2 b of the local government act this information has been provided

councillors declarations of interest are there any declarations of interest this evening i have a declaration in confidential in the 356 donations i sit on one of the committees that have applied meeting however 5th of may 2020 to follow his finance committee that 's i was going to raise it minutes of the finance committee meeting held on the 5th of may 2025 the minutes were accepted by council at its ordinary council meeting here on the 19th of may and i have someone to move those minutes today thank you councilman councilman donald any business arising counsellors no business arising for the recommendation permits to be accepted all in favor page 12 counselors reports item 0501 maryland council of fees 2021-22 there 's a recommendation that council resolves to accept determination when set by the local government enumeration tribunal for the 2021-22 financial year for the mayoral and councillor fee in the 2021-22 operational plan can i have a mover please also call them in a second a counselor okay thank you councillor kellen do you wish to speak to this uh this is um i 'm not speaking against it but i just on the basis that um operational plan is based on a maximum 0.9 percent increase i believe um i 'm just wondering whether we should uh said that 's up to a maximum of 0.9 so that we don 't dislocate our operational plan if the increase is over and above that we don 't anticipate it 's going to be over and above that i understand but if it does go over that then it will put our operational plan um you won 't be right it won 't be correct did you want to amend that recommendation well i 'd put an amendment to say i don 't think he can recommend it through me if i could um the average of the recommendation by the tribunal is normally around two percent are you saying that it could go to two percent it could go to two percent i don 't know i 'm just saying the average for the last five years and we 're basing this on 45.9 so look we can have an amendment here to tap it at 0.9 if i can discuss it before i propose the amendment is that my concern is that we put an operational plan out of the community based on 0.9 it 's accepted and says right increasing 2 then it immediately puts an underlying a critical underlying assumption for the operational plan at risk for it it 's no longer a correct assumption which and i 'm not sure of the magnitude of the change it will have i haven 't_''_324.8 done that but i 'm sure that the director of corporate services might be able to enlighten us as to how much that that change would be so if it was point let 's say at worst was two percent instead of 0.9 how much would that affect the underlying amount in our operation if i could ask that question before we open it and bear in mind councillors that this operational plan is a draft it will go out for public exhibition and it can then be amended when it comes back to resolution council and by then we should know oh we should know what that we definitely should know what um what that percentage will be recommending percentage could i ask what the quantum it was like within the city of i 'm assuming if we double the point be somewhere around about close to it so if you just take two percent of the total turnover how do 15 to 20 000 if we raise it to the two percent so currently we 're putting in about seven and a half to nine thousand somewhere for the point nine four point nine yeah okay so we 're looking at a a delta if i can use that term of about eleven thousand it 's likely we 'll have the remuneration five-year-old 's determination before we actually have to approve this finally yeah and we 're only going to thrive so i i won 't push for an amendment okay thank you is it um just for the uh medical council much more relevant i 'll put that recommendation in counselors all in favor mary thank you page 13 counselors 502 integrated planning and reporting yeah yeah through through the chair counsellors there is a result a recommendation there if if i could draw your attention to item four where we have um the numbers four a four b and four c if councils replace that with four five attachment seven it was just a change in how we put the appendixes together to make them easier to read so the recommendation is that council adopt the draft 2021-22 operational plan and long-term financial plan at a tax rate one and resolved to probably exhibit the plans for 28 days in accordance with the local government act 1993 submissions received during public exhibition period will be considered and presented to the june ordinary council meeting prior to final adoption that council adopted resolved public exhibit the statement of revenue policy and attachment 2 which includes the 2021-22 federal charges and rating structure outlined within report 0.502 in accordance with chapter 15 part 1 of the local government act 1993. the council notes the 2019 22 delivery program at attachment 3 which has been updated with financial data for the 21 22 and 22 23 financial years in accordance with the local government act 1993. the council note the water and sewer asset building and infrastructure asset management plans at attachments four five and six in accordance with the local government act 1993. the council mode for the 2019 22 local government act 1993 the council note that the draft 2021-22 operational plan and long-term financial plan has been prepared in line with the objectives contained in council 's community strategic plan and the integrated planning and reporting requirements within the local government act 1993 the council note the long-term financial plan will be amended annually as more accurate information comes at hand income and expenditure forecasts become more accurate and pencil will consider and utilize a range of options for achieving balanced budget budgets over the life of the long-term financial plan including but not limited to realising efficiencies and cost reductions within council operations applying reserve funds reducing or rescheduling capital expenditure and increasing revenues through possible borrowings to fund specific programs and initiatives the council authorizes the general manager to make any necessary editorial and content changes to integrated planning and reporting documentation for public exhibition in order to give effect to council 's resolutions and i have a mover for those eight recommendations first recognize the enormous amount of work that uh started putting to produce this plan i know how difficult that sort of detailed closely i know there are a number of assumptions that are made in terms of the expenditure and income you will have and although i don 't necessarily agree with all the assumptions uh this is a draft plan and it will be uh amended by community input and will be amended by council as well but i think it is a reasonable document to go forward with uh and i look forward to some robust discussion on this issue thank you councilman um yes i also know the consumer amount of work 's been undertaken to produce this document um i have a number of questions in relation to a couple of documents i 'm not sure whether um you 're likely to ask those now madam mayor or whether you 'd like other people to speak first and come back so if i could go to page three um if i could through madame air um i would like obviously from 20 20 21 forecast 2021 22 forecast there has been have been some quite marked increases in expenses i think some of them have been explained but a man um going from the top down about a third of the page down under expenses from continuing operations the administration expenses are looking to go into 221.22 from 86 000 currently for this year i 'm using whole numbers if that 's appropriate to 159 000. could i ask um i don 't believe that 's what to explain if i could ask the director of corporate services to explain the increase because it 's nearly double can i just mention that some are some of them are explaining some of these comparisons between 21 and 22 will all be explained by the um the director under one let 's say banner so i 'll go down if you could go down sorry i 'm happy with that i was going to ask individually but i 'm quite happy for that thank you madame so through um you 've had amir um the a lot of these figures have been consolidated so they weren 't all under other expenses they were dispersed throughout the program and we 've done quite an extensive review of our gl and we substantial difference in a lot of these numbers such as the administration as well as the advertising there 's also a increase of the 356 assistance program this is just the income the cash component not the inclined component because that is dispersed through other areas of the um operational plan um the debt collection we have reduced substantially because we have made um very good entry in roads into our debt recovery with the new debt recovery process that we have and we 've been very successful this year and doing that we 're hoping that the final figures reflect that in our recovery hence why we 've reduced it um i.t hardware includes um new council so we have we have to um purchase a new new hardware for each of the new councillors that come on board in september so that 's included in that price that 's hence why it 's increased substantially as well as a little bit of hardware in there for the new ems program that we go to will enable outdoor staff to use and operate devices in the field so there it software has increased substantially one because we 've amalgamated them all from the different areas but also there is 200 000 in there for the ems program rollout legal costs we have reduced substantially because we knew that we had some legals last year and this year there is no foreseen legal implications that hence why we 've reduced that substantially um let 's understand that that 's because we don 't have the connection um the subscriptions and memberships is a big one and that was because it was spread throughout and we were quite surprised and we triple checked that one because we knew that it was quite substantial but it is only a consolidation sundry expenses we have reduced because we expect we are encouraging with the new gl restructure that we 're rolling out there won 't be as many sundry expenses now they will actually be allocated correctly telephone and communications we are implementing with the new ems rollouts there will be new programs and so we 're not we haven 't_''_1038.559 spent as much as we expected to and therefore we 're not standard increase as is utilities uh vehicle registration it is very low i have looked at it and it has been placed in the fleet management instead of other expenses so it is still within the operational plan but it 's not in other expenses now so that 's why there 's a substantial um change there we 're not we 're just not registering our vehicles i thought that was like a good idea so i hope that helps yeah so um i know we 've consolidated the administration you said explain that so that 's that 's um meant a doubling of that figure just by the consolidation it has yes and it includes things um like the community newsletter as well so that was in a different area and we 've brought it into administration now under printing and postage so that 's a substantial increase there and with the advertising yeah does that mean that was dispersed across different departments and that 's now been good right yes and we expect to spend 117 000 well we 're hoping that we don 't need to but consultation there 's cost involved in the advertising of that uh when we advertise for new positions um there 's costs involved that includes employee uh no that 's that advertising does include that the consultant 's heritage the heritage committee [Music] i thought we 'd had a couple of quite a few consultants the last few years so i 'm surprised that 's up to double plus the heritage about that through the through the chair certainly in heritage consultant we have a our heritage architect that comes in and supports the heritage committee currently it 's funded through through a one for two or for every dollar we put in they put in a number of dollars and we don 't have the um understanding or that commitment from eoh at this point in time or the heritage office that they 'll continue to do that so we have to basically pay for the whole lot and then look at reducing that through a through a um subsidy if that was offered um we put a note to that account for the assumptions i 'm just wondering i community yeah i think it should be an assumption that we are the the basis of that is on the basis that normally we get a one-to-one contribution um we 're not we 're uncertain as to whether that 's continuing if there is a one-to-one contributor that would produce it or something like that but equally we see the benefit of having that that um outside consultant companies i don 't i don 't think anyone 's arguing no no i 'm just saying that we still recognize it so the council assistance at 356 assistants we 've currently got 85 000 but we 're looking at a 100 000 cash contribution so we have included the hundred thousand uh depending on how the decision goes tonight and confidential about what you intend to um uh award last year was 113 000. we didn 't think it was appropriate to take it all the way back to 85 in case council wanted to as they normally do have some spare funds in that account for late applications and so that 's why we 've left it 100 so if what i say section 356 tonight that it is the figure currently requested or a lesser amount will that be reflected in this draft when it goes out to public comments as per you know we 're we 're going to amend the um we 're going to put a new assumption in relation to assumption in relation to we 've just discussed the heritage consultants so if we come up with a lower figure then that could also be reflected in this cash amount here no it won 't be reflected in this cash amount because i won 't be changing this forecast of the figures but i 'm happy to talk about it in the assumptions and it will be amended when it comes back in june for adoption can i add that also through consultation processes and we may introduce that at that point in time as well i just think the community should be aware of modern wise where we 're going with this more accurately because we 'll have a more accurate reflection once we 've considered inconfidential where we are and through the chair are you 're looking at a draft before exhibition now and then considering other things in a confidential nature i understand that but as we 're putting another recommendation is is it too much to make that figure actually reflect where we end up later this evening yeah okay i just think it 's more it 's better to have where we have the information more accurate okay um through the chair sorry councilman kevin just um being mindful that it will change the bottom line as well yeah i 'm aware of that so understand the ite uh hardware um other council expenses sorry which is that gone from 34 to 90 is that result as a result of the election or what um my apologies i did miss that one that 's actually a result as the requirement by the office of local government that all new councillors undertake professional development training so that 's training which will include a new council or induction all things related to becoming a council right um fully understand the debt collection and i think that 's a great result there um because of the bushfires because premiums are going up um it hardware understand that i.t software the only thing with the it hardware well it may be that some councillors decide not to take a new computer of their own collision because they 've already got enough computers to cope with rather than have another one um but that 's that 's that 's that 's kind of no you can 't not basically i understand that so let 's leave that one um subscriptions and memberships we really paid 273 000 for subscriptions and memberships yeah what 's that local government local government new south wales um so we 've brought all those together is there any way of i know there 's core ones but is there any way i 'm rationalizing any of those it 's a large sum at this point in time but memberships um for the different organizations they mount up when you put them all together so i certainly do all right i think that 's um on that page on page four under the town improvement levy expenditures oh and the community for fitor so that i mean i have requested information as to what the fit out would cost and on a previous occasion and there 's a notice of motion to be brought back to us et cetera so that 's now what we 're budging through the chair that 's not the case not at all as part of this operational plan it 's envisaged that 568 000 will be will be collected from ti and it will be council who make the determination on how they spend that 568 000 if you look at those projects which are proposed projects they 're not confirmed projects there are a number and they add up to a lot more than 568 000 they 're just a number of projects from council staff and operations that we believe would fit into this we are also expecting as part of the notification and the advertising of this document that others may come in as part of a deliberation the council needs to consider these are purely potential projects that you could consider as part of the town improvement fund if the hub rid of it where did the figure of 60 come the 60 came because as part of council 's ongoing development through the library funds that they get from state libraries that was the that was a year 's worth of that absolute figure um it was not pulled out of the air but based on state library um recommendations or statements so there 's that starting from ab initio i.e starting from a blank slate or is that um an enhancement on any furniture we 've currently got i 'm just not it would be it would enhance the finish it gives you another sixty thousand uh technology um and then if i could the next one the apex park toilet block replacement i haven 't actually been in there lately is it to a state that absolutely meant replacing pushing down and [Music] dilapidated state of that particular market being outdated for how many visitors to everyone actually do visit it um and consideration has been limited i suppose through the town improvement should council wish to knock down and rebuild a new type facility there so that uh i don 't have an exact account it does give quite some substantial use on my understanding from the business information that was discussed but i don 't have that vocal figures um and following on from a discussion oh sorry if i could go back so the shared pedestrian cyclone footpath construction we have plan where that 's envisaged to go through the chair and form part of our overall pedestrian access mobility plan and the continuation of that yes right following on from a discussion earlier this evening um should we be putting on their figure for undergrounding power from rally straight to um you know oberon street more than happy to include the project as part of a tenant improvement option for council to consider i think it was came to what was it three hundred thousand three hundred thousand it 's gotta be more than that um through the chair as part of that quote i think we also worked around if you did all through together there 'd be some savings in doing or not doing some of the stuff i 'm going to be around that number more than having the chris to go on well i think should we should it should be put in there on the basis that we may make for someone i mean we could have it split into two is construction to but i think this can be discussed when we make this decision in june yes this is just a draft with some suggestion suggestions on it but i think people should know that we 're considering i mean absolutely and and it should be in there with a figure it 's got a big figure yep and i think we 've agreed that it will go in yeah okay all right um i 'm not sure if there 's anything else we should be looking at um this basically is a wish list and it 's already been explained that you 'll be making the decision at a later date [Music] i struggled to find how the community hub fit out kid come under county improvement um and i i don 't think it should go out on that list in the draft and then i like two and a half thousand the benefit of two and a half thousand right prizes living town in the town managing two and a half years believe outside you know how can that you know the people that live outside the town boundary are going to use you 'd assume that they 'll use some of that building otherwise you wouldn 't be looking at having so i just struggle with that being [Music] fitting in the town improvement criteria you know i think i just don 't think it should be in there to go in the draft through the chair more than happy to have it removed it 's council or all the opinion that they don 't want in there it 's as easy as that well i i support what council keke says when when you have a profile of the people that put in for the hub and all the rest majority of those people are put in for the hub don 't pay tan improvement funds then through some of the lists and then you break it down and they don 't in four i don 't know they wanted to go ahead and all the rest but they don 't contribute to the ti fund most of the submissions that we received from the people don 't contribute to it what 's your favorite council do you want it in or out if we if we need that money later on where can we pull it from that 's what i like to know well it 's it 's it 's a wish list it 's not we 're not here discussing the hub as such we 're discussing this list of suggested projects and if you don 't want that to go out as a suggested project if you 're saying that this wish list that the sixty thousand dollars comes out of ti there must be other funds we got to that stage where we needed that money well we need to highlight where it can be pulled from as well we don 't know that we need it yet this is an enhancement it fits within the criteria it 's part of it 's part of the provision of the number of projects in tio we 're happy to remove it obviously town improvements are an issue at the moment over my time it appears if the wind 's blowing one way town improvement people from outside town do use the assets and if the wind 's blowing the other way then they don 't i 'm just saying there 's a gray area that shifts but i think for the sake unless until we sit down and thrash out the town improvement issue amongst ourselves to come to a conclusion that we represent to the public as a group then i think for convenience we just take this out until we 've dealt with the issue because that 's the issue behind here it 's not 60 000 it 's not the community it 's this political push at the moment about town improvement that 's why we 're stumbling around so let 's avoid it let 's just take it out and discuss that issue actually i think we should leave it in there so that people can make a submission on simply this noting that series of projects which may or may not be appropriate for town prep and fund in the next financial year so let 's leave it there let 's leave them all there make it clear that this the council has made no decision at all on any of these projects but we will make a decision after the consultation period and an appropriate time in council there 'll be a resolution behind that and i think pulling things out at the moment actually limits the the discussion in the consultation group okay counselors what 's the feel of the move we 'll go with the shower pans in again i think that 's got it thank you any other comments on the plan counselors just uh through the corporate services director can you uh give us a few words on why bobby and also the uh appreciation and monetization has gone up quite connected yes um through the chair through the mayor basically we 've had quite a few or not quite a few but we 've had some staff who have been long-term employees retire this year and hence maintain as high a level so that 's why we 've reduced it and regarding the depreciation it 's gone up because all the new um infrastructure and grants that we 've been working on we 've got 1.7 million dollars increase of depreciation given on on three wouldn 't it be better for us to have a list to show us what was pulled together to change these numbers like if you were reading this as an accountant and you read um some of these subscriptions and membership it 's gone from 50 000 to 275. so shouldn 't we have a detailed list of what offers pulled together that come up with these things enormous job i 'm not saying detailed yeah but the the kind of explanations that the director of corporate services gave us a little earlier um i think is appropriate so as a knowledge as a total yeah and subscriptions and maybe where we have it on the summary page because all these people look at the summary page first is if we can have the note number have the notes numbered and say seven because sure that 's going to stop a lot of questions because we know people will look and they 'll see the big number increase but if you 've got c note one they go straight to that note so if we get numb brown notes sure that 'll make a hell of a difference um are you happy with that customer can 't mccarthy yeah and the same on phase 15 16. this might be relevant but say um forwards road kicks in country roads and bridge 358 000 that 's fine when you 're reading that and you think hang on rates and that but we should have how much the council is putting into that in the second column well i think it 's just 31. five or sixteen five i know it 's explained that we 've got a grant for swallows nest road bridge and the bull ridge road um replacement and they 've come under grants but again just say see now you can see where you 're going cancer mccarthy so you 'd like to see what the council contribution is against you got the gross did you have the grant council contribution and then yes under fees and charges um i think at some earlier stage and i 'm not sure if it 's part of the report which to come back to council um the general manager 's indicated um we were going to look at how our waste charge is compared to surrounding [Music] councils in particular commercial type waste etc compared with surrounding councils and whether we were in line with and so we won 't have an opportunity this time to view review it in light of that report we 'll have to do it in 2022 no all right so if paul comes back that outlines some deficiencies in funding council will then have the opportunity to change those um there 's a process that council need to go but you can do that separate to uh endorsement you won 't have to wait 12 months for that to occur okay i 'm happy with that but any idea is that part of the report i think was it may i can 't no no there when we bring it back so it might even be in line with the finalization of this at this point okay it 'd be good if it was it would be but i 'm not done with the problem um the other sorry madame the other matter i 've raised is page 16 of attachment a um one attachment four sorry attachment four of page 16 of it which is the map of the forestry corporation 's police volume estimate map um what page does that count 16 which i know we 've probably seen before but i i did have some problem in getting this enlarged to be able to take a look at it on wondering whether our constituents might have a similar problem i 'm not sure how we 'd better present it but i 'm sure there 'll be some interest but um it 's it 's very hard to work out which roads directly we have a couple of copies of that in our community concentration sessions maybe a b was it a three but biggest b4 isn 't it because people i think would we 've had for uh burrica road arks road campbells river road etc remembering that this is a heat map so it 's not it 's an indicative map but what it does show is that there is a significant amount of trucks going to use our local roads over the next five years yeah that 's why i think it 's going to be an interest yeah so i think we 've got to be prepared to be able to display it properly and could i suggest this is a public exhibition that we somehow managed to show this in a bit of i don 't know how we do it leave that to you well i 'm just suggesting it yep any other comments thank you very much on page 16. just the benchmark there own source revenue ratio it has understandably taken but i would expect that is a common occurrence in the government 's approach to regional development it is a very common occurrence at this point in time through all councils i just didn 't want to make that point uh at the top of the it hardware budgets going from 50 to 15 000 dollars uh you 'll notice that the top of page 15 the second line computer hardware and setup for counsellors is in fact budgeted to increase from six to eleven thousand it 's only a five thousand dollar increase from potential hardware no through the chair i actually also said that it was there was hardware in there for the new ems for the outdoor staff to be able to operate in the field i do i do appreciate that uh can i just confirm this this table relates to the effect that covert has had so it is setting up counsellors remotely and that 's where the cost is it is not the total cost we 're anticipating that if that happens again or there is a outbreak of covered we would need to do something that 's why we 're we 're giving it a value as we move across an assumption um okay you know the forecast deficit was for about forty thousand dollars and then we said that 's okay because we 've got it 's 1.7 million dollars of depreciation addition additional appreciation but the 40 000 is real money and 1.7 million of depreciation is just an allowance [Music] page 16. [Music] i do argue particularly with this discussion about town improvement and community philosophy facilities etc i do consider to suggest council looks in the long term to uh increasing their rural respect i just feel that 's a growth area in our i know there 's certain formulas but there 's a growth area in our revenue base h17 um am i reading this right the um service and residential and industrial wastewater sewage charges it was an error we initially did um considered cpi and then we ended up with five percent and that was an error we 've got to take cpa so you 're suggesting it is five percent why five percent we 've had those increases in water charges of three years and five or ten percent well they were there level last year i think they have not increased it 's been cpi for three years okay um why do we need a five percent interest it your sewer and water funds need to be sustainable for the critical infrastructure we 're that far out that we needed to five percent depression was not was not still a balanced budget for the last few years it is but you 're planning on doing a new stp i just think all the other charges were increasing 0.9 just and i know sue it needs to be i just think that 's residential water service it 's not being a town president so for for a resident they 've got 370 230 plus um 667.90 plus per kiloliter and then their sewer charge is obviously equal to their water consumption that will increase by 50. um page 20 through the chair i 'd be more than happy to bring back other areas rates if council was on that line as well for you they 'll comment in the community just the three five six assistants we 're going to revisit that i gather i think we should increase that allowance generously we 'll come back to it again draft [Applause] and i draw your attention to the attachments five progress in application population projections etc etc we 've always had the idea and it 's mentioned in here that we could go fully funded or if necessary we might find an alternative is this still a realistic assumption that we 'll be fully funded happy to discuss in confidential careful okay that 's pretty um um i have quite a few benefits that maybe i will just put them on a piece of paper don 't worry thank you any other comments on this one one more councilman kevin thank you madam man i 've got a couple actually but they all deal with the same area um pages 18 of the um main report that a man got the um so i don 't think under the domestic waste management charge is the two percent cpi again the cpi should be taken out that 's correct and in the next one non-domestic wage management charge 2 again oh they 're sorry um that 's correct could you and it may be too through to the technical services director could you explain the expenditure of 70 000 on a upgrade and 10 000 on the record shed through the chair i can give you an insight to item one which is the two-way radio system we currently have a an outdated system in terms of a two-way radio capability it 's going to a i suppose an upgraded radio system that has better clarity capability working off again two separate repeater stations um substantial upgrade there but also with that would be handsets and vehicles and also midfielders that could be as part of the whole one upgrade it just seems a lot of money for a preferred two-way radio system but i suppose it includes repeater stations maybe an explanation i was just assuming it was a fit fit out of the um the handsets etc and vehicles that are existing replacement but it 's not you 're happy that 70 000 is appropriate form yesterday we 've done some uh scoping with companies um to arrive at a budget figure so yes that is where that would lie in that order of seventy thousand dollars and what 's envisaged with the store upgrade the third last item the we are working on improving the facilities that restore new shelving um scanning equipment so that we can scan items in and out that 's the start of that and the regular check so i 'll take that one if you want so the record shed previously with the amount of paper that we 're we 're accumulating you need to store that we were looking at putting a new shed on the in within the depot to in fact cater for that um we are moving away from that i believe at this point in time into a more documented electronic way of dealing with that um the director of uh planning and development has just just secured fifty thousand dollars to in fact enhance our planning portal and it was envisaged that this may be an opportunity to in fact reduce the need for a shed and have a a [Music] previously that was 30 dollars and we 've reduced it to ten to try and tie into that group so do we really need it at all if we proper digitize what and save our materials the records housing probably is a better word than a record shed it is not a physical shed it 's using that that was a physical layout in a housing yes which is put out in a secure i think we 've left it like that because it 's in fact one of the savings that we found during trying to find 1.7 million so maybe more record storage would be more appropriate because that then leaves it open is that it um the workforce management plan was really interesting but attachment 6 building asset management plan for our purposes though just on page 18. third last paragraph currently little budget of 52 400 for 2018 nine seconds is overall playground trade structures there is before i put this recommendation in line two or note two there that should read apparently allocated over on common town improvement funds not the town improvement fund if you could just make that adjustment so it 's council transfer 34 714 from the currently allocated oberon common town improvement fund to complete the shade sale etc so if you could make that adjustment before is that council elect to proceed with option two of the ellis and sons quotation in order to deliver this project prior to the 30th of june 2021 that council transfer 34 714 from the currently allocated oberon common town improvement fund to complete the shade sale project at a total combined value of 113 000.50 113 500 hundred dollars they 're remove the place mr this is a huge amount of money and many of us will say in the good old days we wouldn 't need shades over our nowadays this is a necessity we have to do it and and it is a huge amount of money but it 's just something that we have to accept and that 's something that we have to do yeah i 'm happy to move the recommendation thank you councillor council i 'm happy to support councillor cable 's comments thank you any other comments councillors um thank you um well i support um the shade cloth and the necessity for it i 'm just not certain that we shouldn 't be proceeding with option one i 'm uncertain as we are covering eighty percent of the playground at the playground i 've seen a number of other playgrounds where the climbing rope areas are not covered i don 't think we would be putting ourselves in the at this legal position if we have 80 of the of the area covered i i just think it 's it 's increasing the expense quite a lot by doing it we 've already um we obviously allocated a hundred thousand from the community 's fund for the provision of the shade cloth um and now now it appears that we 've under budgeted on the basis that it 's well and truly covered in black springs but we haven 't covered fully the common um if we were to go with option one i think we 'd only be having to reallocate roughly five and a half to six thousand from the town improvement uh sorry from the com from the oberon common town improvement fund to um to this rather than a considerable amount more 34 700 so that 's my view but i would listen to others and if 's my personal view if you 're going to cover some why should why should the climbing ropes not be covered what what 's the children are still exposed the same amount of uv whether they 're on the climbing ropes or the mouse or the swings they 're playing in the park they 're also what they are if they 're playing in the park not in the playground they 're also exposed you 're going to cover the whole playground if you 're taking that line why are we doing it at all is we 're required to do it we 're recommended we 'll recommend it it 's not required it 's definitely recommended and we are covering 80 of it if you 're proposing amendment i 'm happy to take that and see if i 've got i 'll support him if he 's gone to the amendment i think it 's the same thing we just don 't go down and have a jail that they 've got to play in this ground the kids are allowed to run over and run over to the we we 're not locking them up under the shade so i think there 's scope that we don 't have to go to this extremity well i propose an amendment um as follows um recommendation one would read the council like to proceed with option one provide five separate trades covering eight percent the adventure playground leaving the climbing ropes uncovered option two will read i haven 't done the figures i saw we 've got this pencil transfer i think it will be about 5 000 something from the town from the sorry oberon common town improvement fund to complete the site the shade sale project has set out in recommendation one the total combined that new all 84 090 bracket excluding gst right so let 's see and we 're seconded by council mccarthy yes 836 [Music] four sorry the additional option 87 the additional options do include the shade structures says so additional options are for spikes which we recommend happy and you 're happy yeah i 'm speaking against the amendment you will note on page 23 that the common working party reviewed both options and we also need to take into account the protection of our asset from the sun as well there that 's just a minor to me a minor um advantage of it but i 'm speaking against the recommendation because i think it should all be covered and lead me to the punch there about the recommendation of the common working party but council does have a duty of care to everybody that uses the facilities there uh and i think it would only be a a very short matter of time before we came under pressure from carers of children who were using the the playground facility there and about why we only had part of it the recommendation is that the playgrounds be covered and i accept that children are not fenced in there and that they 're free to come and go but i think the time that they they 're using those facilities we as i say have a duty of getting after them and i think uh we need to bite the bullet and do it any other comments councilman i love the comments i to proceed with option one of the ellis and sons quotation in order to do this project prior to june 30th 2021 the council transfer 884 from the currently allocated overall common town improvement fund to complete the shade sale project at the total combined value of 87 720 exclusive gst all in favor of the amendment three all against the amendment the amendment 's lost you know that back to the original motion i 'm going to put the original recommendation or in paragraph against thank you page 43 counselors item 0504 modified development application 1 0 2 0 2 0 5 1.2 shared patio cover and carport and remove three existing ships and the recommendation is that council vary part c.5.5 of the building height plane and part c6.4 carports and garages of its current gcp 2001 associated to modify development application 102020.51.2 for construction of a shed patio cover and carport at lot 13 in dp2364 section d being known as 10 springfield street oberon but a division be called in accordance in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993 and i have a i was a little bit confused at the same time several times as in particular page 46 trying to work out where the existing structures are and where the new carport and garage is to go on the site is it necessary for the existing free sheds and carport and i think it is for the carport but i 'm not sure about the three existing sheds to be demolished before this building works can actually be undertaken i think it counts it through the chair um i think the uh the requirement for the demolition is to bring the square meter right or the overall square meterage of these sheds down to closer to the dcp requirement um i understand that but there 's no recommendation or nothing to say or a compulsory order to say that these three existing sheds and carport have to be demolished as a precursor to any construction commencing and my concern is that we may need it through a third recommendation with the three existing structures and the carport be demolished before construction commences because i 'm not sure from the plan on the photograph it 's on page 44 the plan on page 46 um i 'm actually not certain i can see the carport on the photograph at the bottom of page 44. i i 'm actually not and the photograph above it is not really clear on where the existing sheds to go and then i 've got the map on 46. my concern is that the constructions occurs and some or other of the existing sheds remain without a specific requirement that these have to be demolished before construction commences or um no development approvals given or something that that occurs you enlighten me to the contrary please i think it goes through the chair um council we we would ensure that those chairs are demolished by the issue of an occupation finalization of the application so we wouldn 't undertake that process until those shits are removed all right as long as it 's an absolute requirement of it 's a development would be application because it 's um [Music] it actually doesn 't reference that in the recommendation so it 's a requirement a council is acting system and then basically to ensure that compliance with the the development extent is achieved okay it 's just that the whole development consent i don 't think it 's referenced here we don 't have the wording of that okay i think the only only reference is in the summary at the top is that right through through the chair you 're being asked to to um sign off on the variation the variation of the decision not the application right here okay all right well if that 's the case i 'm happy with it um i just wanted to make clear i 'm sure that that was the situation because i 've seen people skirt around things like this before answer any other comments foundational there 's 56 councillors closed session confidential reports in accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government general regulation 2005 and the opportunity general manager the following business is a behind us referred to in section 108 graphic two of the act it should be dealt with being part of the meeting both the media and public i 'd us to see me on the zoom meeting i now call for a counsellor to move us into post session councilman gibbon and the second to councilman all in favor harry thank you let me just have a clarification before um _"

call councillors item 4 record of attendance there are no legal absences this morning besides this evening sorry page five item five declarations of interest are there any declarations of interest this evening um madame i don 't believe i have the declaration of interest but i do in 1303 which deals with water cards i have returned my water card so that should not now preclude me from voting on that issue so i just know that as a matter of the record page six counsellors item six presentations we have with us this evening greg bourne president of the over and karen i heard railway and david mcmurray who will provide a presentation to councillors regarding upcoming works at the oberon taranai heritage welcome thank you everybody should have a color handout on on the desk there in front of them and i 'll produce this just in case that there 's a complete build up to the file i gave to sharon but it seems to be there at the present time and so what you 've got in front of and um i 'm under jurassic because kathy 's already told me but i better be quick i 'll move along fairly quickly and um yeah over on tarana heritage been in existence now since about 2006 2007 and we have you know various people who work extremely hard over you know over the 15 16 years since it 's been up and running um so next slide will it really okay on that one some of this is not my work by the way this was this particular the first part of it was done back in 2008 it 's a publicity thing and some of you may have seen it somewhere before and the original line was constructed as a pioneer branch line which means that it was um pretty much well in those days it was timber sleepers fairly light raid rail and no ballast it was there they graded the road at the uh well we 'll call it the road or the line with where the line was going to go granted it flat laid the sleeves and fits the rail to it with dog we had mostly 19 class locomotives moving freight in and out of the town next slide please now why is the line being restored it 's got a potential to boost tourism the tourist business boosts the local economy it 's close to other tourist attractions over on stations will preserve that in good order and it 's surprising the last interaction branch line close to sydney and much of the surviving infrastructure that was put down is in quite good order and a lot of that 's now especially between here and hazel grove and that 's where i 'm focusing tonight is between over on and hazel grove and the people who sort of started back in 2006 uh relayed a lot of the traffic they put in a lot of renewable sleepers that you know he 's in quite clueless um there 'll be a few people in our organization who would say you know there 's more to this that means the eye quick and some of you may know what a gunslinger is a person who 's because we 're interested in rail we 're do with us we just want to see the trains running and we 'd like to have steam here and do all these wonderful things anyway there 's something in it for everybody here it 's even something for the farmers uh andrew we 've we 've been clearing the line of recent times and i can tell you where the uh saint john 's wort is down there where the blackberry bushes are flourishing and we 're going to kill them all so thank you very anyway so next slide please and so i 've just said mostly that yeah a lot of the line between hazel globe and oberon has had the sleeves relayed in time the overall yard has been improved the rolling stock shed has been built and three extra rows into the shed have been added the station building has been refurbished and the station 's back platform has been rebuilt and some of the road crossings have been uh reinstated and upgraded etc and albion street and those may upgrade two of those in particular next slide please and where are we now we june last year we have trained up some local people and they are now licensed or have certification to move the locomotives in in the yard and that 's something that hadn 't happened before and it 's made it so that we we can practice we can shift we can make movements and as we move towards hazel grove those locomotives will be used used much more over greater distances next slide please and we 've got two photographs here one of them on back in october when we use the locomotive ship with the two end battle cars out of the rolling stock shed and we 've got michael o 'kane who 's probably our premier first-class railway carriage restorer he 's taking the you can see he 's finished it on taking the carriage back to the wood there and completely repainting it and that 's taken a lot of you know a few people in the organization quite a lot of time to do that and we had people were from transport heritage here last or last month and they 're very impressed with the work a part of works under the banner of transport from new south wales and we 've got those on what the two end platform cars in custodial management agreement which means we keep them under cover we keep them neat and tidy we repair them when when we when it needs repairs etc and everybody benefits and next slide please and we have a committee with experience and administration we have people who are expert in rail infrastructure funds financial expertise publicity and writing grant applications as well as people who don 't mind putting in the long hours of pulling sleepers out and putting new ones in next slide please um so we 've got line managers which boosts the overall number of volunteers that we 've got and the line managers aren 't necessarily members of the committees somebody like the rolling stock manager and driver training and so we 've got a fair bit of organisation and expertise in the organisation and i did a recent uh 12 monthly tally of the total hours of volunteer hours worked and their dollar value was 170 000 and that i didn 't i don 't know how much work dave spent but he does a grant application so i didn 't add those figures in but what happens is that they say well what 's your input going to be and you 're allowed to say we 're going to put a thousand hours in and they say that you can claim uh thirty dollars per hour so if it 's a thousand that would be three hundred thousand or something anyway so any next slide please labor on that particular one now i just this is probably one on here more than everything cdt cdg 1296. this is the grant that was given or bestowed upon us by andrew j just before the election in 2019 and it 's for 1.5 million and gary would be able to confirm the fact that it 's been a lot of tooling and throwing the care bearer between othr and the first thing we had to do to get our fingers on the money was actually convince them that we 're actually an organisation that could handle that sort of money managed to convince them that we could could do that and the final agreement was actually only signed back in january february of this year and so far we 've we 've had our first milestone payment paid out to us at 50 000 and that 50 000 has been um i 've got to get this right has been used at this point in time to employ a um a right well it 's called rail planning service as a company we had a scope of works that was prepared by our vice president ken lingard and ken is a um a railway person he 's an expert in in per way in that means track and he 's worked for artc john holland rail and he 's worked as a consultant and he and a number of us sort of we managed to walk the track between hayes grove and oberon and counted the number of sleepers and so we had a scope of works which we 've then handed over to roman planning services and in recent times if you you would have seen the surveyors down we 've had other people looking at the line from that particular and they and royal planning services was a successful tenderer and we put it out to five different uh groups that can recommend it these people would be interested no point getting people in that don 't know what we 're talking about and so the rail planning services have undertaken to have the tender documents ready by the end of this particular month and so there will be a um a period of time where we look at the tender documents and then we will find out who 's interested in doing the job and letting those tender documents out and from there the uh what have we got 100 1.5 and 2001 there 's going to be another probably another 1.4 million dollars spent between here and hazel grove in the next 12 months and i think that that 's one of the reasons why i just want people to listen to what i want to say tonight that the money won 't be wasted it will be end up with a fairly much equality job rail planning services are recommending that we still need to replace 3000 sleepers between here and there there will be lengths of rail there will be modifications to some of the level crossings there will be work on culverts um etc etc so the money is um is there it 's being spent and we 're working working on that at the moment i think we might move to the next one i 'll be and so you can see there that uh really we 're over on tarana heritage railways is really over under hazel grove at this point in time in march 2000 and what i 've just gone through most of the that there we 've got a tender document is being prepared at this point in time next slide please and as we go through this particular process is other work that needs to be done and that 's one of the reasons why the job takes so long that we have to work with the answer which is the office of national rail safety regulator and we need to vary our current accreditation from over very robust safety management system in a place to coincide with application to we 've had a zoo meeting in recent times with last week with the answer they 're coming back towards the end of may to have another visit next slide please and uh the future we 've got a railroad there and that 's owned by patterson points which is a heritage royal group in or over the easter long weekend and patterson points had that particular well they had a rail motor out at baptist and our driver trainer and dennis turner is um he operates with us he 's trained our locomotive drivers we 've got um he also um drives um trains for uh local valley rail patterson points and he was actually driving one of the patterson points locomotives out at um on the math this weekend and he uh instigated a discussion with them and they in paris and point said well um as a heritage rail group we would like to bring people from central station up to taranak transfer them up to buses into into oberon for you know weekends as an example of what might happen in the future and you know train two carriages full or something like that so that 's uh something to do that could happen in the future i think if you hit the let 's hit the button now i 'm not sure what happens here it 's not going to get started now look for any questions i know it 's been a bit quick and all i wanted to do really was to say that we we 're moving through the process of getting the money from canberra into oberon basically can i just say congratulate the group because this is really gaining some momentum now and it 's really good to see and you guys just worked so hard and do appreciate it are there any questions councilman kevin uh thank you very much um so greg you 've um you 've got your some drivers trained to shunt around the over on yard so they have to be uh they have to be further trained to run on the hazel grove line or is that part of the answer trained to shunt around the over on yeah to extend that training to be able to operate trains to hazel road what further training do they require or is it or does the line just have to be accredited no no we will have to what we 'll have to happen is that dennis turner is the dennis turner is just recently retired he worked he retired from from um ssr which is southern short hall rail um and he also had contractual work with the instruction company which is based in germany and he will well he 's over here you know he was here last saturday he 'll be here next saturday so he will actually have to take a locomotive out on the line once it 's done and learn learn the track yes come back and and he will have to do that and then he will take the people that are currently um qualified for the uh they will they will have to learn now you know they have to get an accreditation the accreditation will be the same you know they are accredited but if you know if you were working with safe at southern shore and you wanted to take a cold train from lithgow to to central not that they go to central but down to sydney you would end up having to learn the track and then you learn it from somebody 's experience in this case and you know dennis has done done that with plenty of drivers at various times do you give does that answer your question yes give a quick secret so i think you 've spent 50 000 for um the rail planner you 're spending 1.4 million on the tractor hazel grove yes there 's 52 000 remaining what are you spending that on say that again you 've got a ground of 1.502 yeah 1.502 million yeah you said you 're spending 50 000 on the rail planner 1.4 on the track between tarrant and hazel grove so you 'll have 50 odd thousand left what are you spending that on that 's a contingency actually that was pretty loose i was doing the maths that 's pretty bad and if i could as and the general rope with land slips yes so when you 're getting this line extended to taranah so they could bring the tourists in via that light what is it going to cost to go to taranak from hazelgrove well it depends on on who 's actually doing it and what you were doing if we wanted to have a a kenlinga lingard uh costed it to go from this is on in here as a a refurbished heritage line 78 million okay but if there 's am i allowed to say anything else here no well i didn 't catch that but right okay talk to cathy i think what andrew 's asking is how much it 's going to cost or what is what is ken calculated using the heritage line yeah it 's 70 around 70 million you know you 've got a you 've got you 've got two bridges there which you 're going to take that dollar before yeah and you know the fish river and the other other bridge yes one of them you know you wouldn 't want to drive a go between hazel grove and it 's pretty rugged as you go down the hill and we um well sort of about april of last year we actually had our heritage license application in to go to carl wood and in the end we pulled out of it because we as as an organisation we don 't have enough volunteers we don 't have enough money and the job 's too big you know the only way we could do it would be to have a guarantee from the government to actually do it you know there 's no way that a volunteer organization can do the work um if you 've been down if you 've been down that line you would have been and there are areas there where there 's uh where the cliff has actually come down onto the line there 's wash aways um it 's it 's it 's pretty rugged to go from uh from hazel to coal and from there on from cardwood on um the big thing is is to get the two bridges more than anything and then there 's done sorry we couldn 't get it under the replacement wooden bridges project they have to be they have to be how 's you 've made reference to uh safety management systems yes what exactly is involved with the safety management system that you 're talking about you said um what did you say you 're upgrading it or working on the safety management system what 's involved if you go on the answer website you 'll find there are 27 categories of areas that we have to address as part of our safety management system every one of those would have between three and 15 documents and it goes it runs for example um i 'll fill it in a form for a month on some monthly report and one of the things that you would do is that we 're moving towards um having locomotive movements out in the public arena you would have to have risk management and in september and october we had three meetings with onsen down here they came and we worked through so it has to be a whole risk management section on people knowing that if they come along even as a volunteer is really an emp is regarded as an employee if you come to to work at the railway or under the influence of drugs and alcohol and all of that the response the responsible person has to say goodbye you know and then you know there has to be sort of regular checks on that sort of material so we 've got two risk management drugs and alcohol and then asset management if you 've got these um in platform cars and locomotives they has to be um certified to a particular fit for you standard and so that 's part of the sms documents so we could go if go on our website and click on the sms documents and you 'll see that you know it 's it 's almost impossible to sort of define but there are a number of different categories associated there 's governance um you know how do you hold a toolbox meeting before you start a working day all that sort of material has to be is part and parcel of it uh robert christie johnson 's interests along there as you probably know um the actual railway line of mr christie johnson 's original ground comes back towards south over the brothers ridge didn 't it we 're in that gully there there 's a stockwood there on the road guess what there was a stock grid i think there 's a um yes yeah there so does he have to put a stock grid or are you going to be going to put the stock grid on his property and we can put gates there instead of a stock no guarantee that they 're going to be shut or left if there 's gates okay that 's fine if there 's a stock grid there we we will make sure that it 's part of the job and rail planning services have looked at all of those okay and they will they will have made recommendations as to which was which needed can we find out what the action is somewhere in the next 18 months you have to have the money spent and line open the housing right correct crossing because i wanted to help me straighten the one that uh blows me up i 'm only asking because the volume i know you 're not going to be running every hour on the hour or six days a week but there is a lot of heavy traffic 24 7 in and out of those planes one semi trailer every minute yeah during working hours you know you can realistically you can see some rather large delays um not large but you can see delays and frustration with um heavy trafficking also a level crossing interface agreement and that has to be done between ourselves and the council and then on so we look at that to make sure that what is intended to happen is there but at the present time we would be uh you know we 're talking about running maybe uh well saturday or a sunday on you know maybe two or three train movements and so you 're going to have one going out and one coming back maybe one going out one that 's four trade movements across albion street and four across is that the the uh we won 't be usurping the rails right and right of way we will actually stop and make sure that everything is safe before we proceed across does that answer your question yes yeah yeah well um you know the other question we had was around the cost associated with the management on level crossing does that come out of the 1.5 million yeah if the if the metal crossings need to be refurbished and pulled up and redone and that will come out in the 1.5 yeah and it costs about 75 thousand dollars to return each one so the rail planning services have looked at that and they will be making recommendations as to which ones need to be pulled up and renewed etc etc yeah thank you excellent presentation any other questions thank you very much greg and david i hope i didn 't take too much time thank you so much for coming in and it 's also very interesting thank you thank you thank you thank you i 'll let you tell it as well good luck thanks for your we 're on page six and we 're on section seven questions from the public are there any questions from the gallery this evening no questions from the public thank you the recommendation is that the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on the 16th of march 2021 been confirmed going to have a mover please councillor people and councilman mccarthy thank you any business arising um just a statement on the um requirement to by councillor you 're kibben um what page do you want to have fun it 's the most emotional one on a6 yeah um my understanding the um general managers indicated that it comes back in a confidential report um due to the requirement of the gas it was a contractual thing for the builder that should be an open council because there 's three other parties have that information as well so it 's not confidential um through the chair that 's not my recollection um there 'll be a number of reports whatever 's confidential will go into confidential whatever this public will go on the publisher okay now i just want to because there was three other builders that didn 't weren 't successful and they had that information as councils aware there 's only certain things you can put in confidential and that 's what we intend to do thank you also on the basis that i had no justification i couldn 't vote against it and i did vote for it but um that 's just not reflected in that amount um the the vote on page 10 on council downstairs so we 'll get that fixed up thank you councillor any other any other business from the minutes i 'll put that recommendation all in favor thank you works committee meeting 30th of march 2021 the recommendation is that the minutes of the works committee meeting model the 30th of march 21 be ripper um right i thought pretty wrong that we we got a multi-time but on page four [Music] yes any other business arising councillors what the recommendation will behave age seven counsellors mayoral minister report and i have someone to move that report item is received as information counselor mccarthy and councillor thank you i wish to say that you 've been busy how 's the column um um i know that there was correspondence for mr cool concerning the state of the road between here in the great western highway in particular made by hollow road i can 't count the number of people who 've spoken to me about the state of those roads and how dangerous they are it 's very important that we have gone straight to the local member and i think we probably should follow in the near future as well i will be following that up and i will say that um mr tool has referred that to transport new south wales who have referred it to lisco council and they 're working together on that but i 'm certainly happy to follow that up on the same issue in um madame so having traveled that way recently early in the morning it is horrendous for the sun in your eyes to reckon and a couple cars and nearly accidents in front of me as you go the crest you cannot see on that road with the sun in i don 't know how we avoid that obviously the width of the road doesn 't assist but i don 't know if we need a warning sign or something for people traveling early in the morning it really is you know um claudia who was was driving with me he said how are you keeping your eyes open she said i just can 't do it there 's something right thank you councillor counselor danny um correspondence on the 17th of march mayor michael english over on golf club requests for use of bridge timbers at the oberon golf club response provided nature of request and the response um the golf club would ask if they could have some of the old abercrombie bridge timbers to incorporate with their build of a recreation area outside the club and i believe they and we had an objection to that and i believe they 've been over and had a look at them and i think that 's how we progress they 're going to use some of those bridge temperatures okay that 's good and i think it 's good are still in the council do you know i know they 've used them on the signage and now they 've used them i think it 's good i just wanted quite a few yes through this year substantial amount of timber there the golf club was looking at acquiring six to eight lengths five meter lengths of timber to build an outdoor area and through madame relating to that um as well as this uh that we do the same thing with those tempers we reclaim what 's reclaimable and put it back into possession for use by people over time um is that still in the director of technical services or the mayor 's mind matter man yeah that 's certainly the case yes thanks very much um and also on the 7th of april madame mayor page 9. samantha 's sin raising concern about illegal water harvester can we give us some more information on that um samantha singh um is concerned about the number of dams being created on maldara in relation to a dried-up creek and she has put in an official complaint to the toward new south wales thank you madame thank you any other questions on this one the recommendation all in favour karen thank you page 10 councillors now this is a motion 1001 request to explain extend the speed zone on abercrombie road the motion is that council request transport for new south wales to review the existing 80 kilometer speed limit at the oberon town entrance on abercrombie road and consider reducing this speed limit to 60 kilometers an hour to a reasonable distance south of the equestrian center can i have a mover please that 's a lion a second place councilman thank you wish to speak to this council online uh yes this um speed limit hasn 't changed in 12 years that i 've been using that road but the uses of it has changed with the new subdivision what concerns me most is that the trucks coming up over the crest of the hill to the reef road where it used to just be local traffic would come out of there but we have campers caravans boat trailers all sorts of traffic coming from there now 've got large trailers on with loaded with horses that can 't pull up quickly so my suggestion is that we move it the 60 kilometer if we can pass the equestrian center i think madame uh yeah i think it 's fair enough if somebody 's concerned about something to ask for a review and the appropriate authority will make the decision um yes i would have thought this matter would should be referred to the traffic committee it has no it 's a regional road council oh it is a regional right so all right we 're referring it to the transporter any other comments this one council mccarthy yes madam um i honestly think in the long term i i think this will become a milk and ground for the police and i know when was on the uh traffic committee before the equestrian centre had their own traffic control that was given to them that when they have an event on they can actually put signs out that to let them people know and reduce the speed so that 's already been addressed in previous things previous times so it doesn 't hurt maybe to have a look at it but i think you 'll find it 'll end up a milk and feel for the young police to be honest it 's a long clear road it 's got good vision and uh yeah so anyway any other comments on this one comes from me um have some doubts on whether it um will help um it 's it 's one of the wider clearer approaches to town there 's already a significant drop back from quite a distance yeah out that way anyway i have to agree with council mccartney that after what i saw this afternoon it could could be um a revenue-raising opportunity for some people so i i had some reservations about moving it out that far as i said it 's over a kilometer from the equestrian sound of the reef turn off the reef turn off down to the turn up in the river street is very clear and you can see all the way down there right around down past john bryan 's so i i don 't 're not up there all the time there would be issues there are everywhere there 's councilman kevin uh mentioned on the on the sidewalls room but uh there are issues with people doing the wrong thing on freeways everywhere so i can 't see reducing the speed limit is probably all an end all of the issue so i can 't support that just while we 're on this matter and it 's a little bit different we have to support the local log industry when there 's a funeral on that they 're past the cemetery they distinctively slow down and lots of times they don 't use their exhaust rate so you 've got to give credit where credit is due it 's got you know really good sight distance it 's got easing lanes and overtaking you start bringing it back to 80 or 60 you know we 'll be looking at south creek right then there 's which is not near as good and i mean it 's 100 kilometers an hour out there i probably support coming to the top of the hill leading the reef where are the signs there i 'm not too sure right at the reef road yeah and it 's a 60 years it goes to 60 matter of meters from the reef road the trucks are coming up over the hill they don 't have much of a sight i think there 's a reason that you could have a look at introduce the 60 kilometers as you come over the hill i think it has excellent sidelines and excellent approaches onto the road so i think that 's a limited issue i won 't comment on the equestrian center although i 'll i 'll take the advice from chancellor mccarthy that they have their own traffic control authority during the events but this is a letter that we 're sending to traffic new south wales transport for new south wales so yeah let 's just send the letter and ask them if they think it 's worthwhile if not they will say now the i 'm going to put the recommendation all in place one two three four five again recreation ground fence the motion is there for 2021 year to purchase and install caps on the new open recreation ground fence refer quote qu0073 on the 23rd of february 2021 at a cost of one thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars plus sixty equals one eight nine o dollars furthermore should this project under the current funding application yield any savings at the o 'connell village fund be reimbursed these monies for using other upcoming local projects can i have a mover place council dhoni and second to place council mccartney thank you did you speak to this council dhoni uh i think the reasons are pretty straightforward it 's just really an administrative thing when we last dealt with this the caps was the only item that was not clearly funded we were talking about extra timbers needed and preservation spray on the fences but we didn 't nail the caps and rather than wait until there 's a reconciliation later on in the project to see if there 's any available money left over for capstan i just thought if we could just order them now and identify the funding source it will just with that wooden fence a lot longer life longer life as the original concrete one that we 've proposed would have the longer one but anyway we 've gone with a timber one and we proposed okay yeah and i actually seen them one of the concrete posts and rail one on the weekend while i was way down wagga and i had to pull up and make sure it was concrete but yeah they 'd really do it good so when you 're in a car you can 't think that it 's comfortable you 're walking beside you jim councilman the finished council mccarthy thank you yeah councilman kevin look thank you i i support this but i just like a little more detail um so the 1830 plus 60 is including installation i 'm assuming why is it plus 60 what 's the plus 60. it was the costing on that i 'd have to call up 23rd of february it was um i think it was two different sizes i think i 'm not sure what the 60 is for okay are these galvanized metal are with the heritage nature of this fence to have galvanized caps they may very well be i 'm just asking the heritage committee people who are on this council that 's number one through you madame i think we did mention that discuss that with the general manager and the director of technical services that we would be looking for um low uh coloration or galvanized plain caps that 's in keeping with heritage i 'm assuming it is that is known to be a practice that 's incorporated into interferences of this nature i know it 's currently incorporated in defenses of this nature i 'm not sure that it was originally my only question is if it isn 't should they be a different color but anyway i will leave that to the people who are on the heritage committee secondly is it these caps normally are obviously square they tap on with a rubber hammer and two nails are put in can 't_''_2950.079 the installation be done by the coal community group through you madame i guess depending on the nature of the caps if the contractor they you know a bunch of community members could do i see no reason why they would not be uh keen to do that i mean i just i i don 't know um of the 1830 plus 60 1890 how much is installation and how much is the middle caps metal caps are pretty cheap two or three dollars each for this year i don 't think there was a labor component but there was just more for information at the time regarding the two different sizing caps that would possibly be options to put on the tops of the posts so the 1890s for the caps alone that 's correct right no insulation okay well but we might have to then amend that motion how does council sit with the council asset um being um fixed up by a community group how does that abram does it all um through the chair if it was done in an appropriate way that was me the requirements i don 't see any problem with what what the nature of the work would be in this instance i think it 'd a couple of rubber hammers and maybe they nail one they 've got two holes just though but if they 're quite reasonable no objection at all throughout america if the quote 1890 doesn 't include installation of just peeling the materials well um we 've probably got to amend the motion in any event to say to purchase install boxes i think the the quote from which it was taken was a quote for all the materials of the fence and then there was a labor price through the through the chair we don 't have a copy of the document i might suggest that we uh amend the first paragraph to authorize um some of up to 2500 for the caps can be sourced by the o 'connell community group uh call um village fund discussions i 'm sorry to be paid for by the the everyone sorry carl village fund so the amendment is come from that um purchase and install caps on new oconto recreation ground uh up to a cost of twenty thousand dollars do you have a second cup of question for mike on i think that we might find that um there may be um some more expensive caps that will be more suitable and if so we give the community group the latitude to do that anyone else speaking to the amendment council thank you i um as a council i didn 't think we could direct how the five thousand dollars paid in the accommodal village fund is to be spending we give them five thousand dollars that 's what we 're giving them this view um they determine how they spend that five thousand dollars and come back to account for us don 't they with how they want to spend it okay so so through through the chair each community group provide a letter indicating what they want to spend it on and it gets debated at council okay i thought that we just gave them five thousand that 's been about how they like um through the chair no that 's not the case okay i 'm happy with the ignore anyone else speaking to the amendment just for information about that i have the quote up on coin was dated the 23rd of february from kia aurora rural contractors and the tin caps are snug fit 7x7 183 at ten dollars each and the tin caps snug fit nine by nine so they might be the corner posts or the two yeah six at ten dollars each 1890 so that 's why there 's two prices that 's what they reflect just the cost of the cap and then the quote goes down to just have costs and then there 's obviously an allowance labour within the quote for your information council thank you man sorry does that throw you to the director of technical software does that include the incorporate the additional fence that we have done for the extra 75 meters because there are probably two larger posts plus a number of others maybe three extra plates i don 't know the quotation that was received was for the additional 75 meters with the option of post caps for council 's consideration at the time i can 't_''_3335.119 be clear on the actual labor component of fitting those but assume that uh you know it them fitted but no sorry man that 's the question was we have the existing fence along kong road we have the initial piece of fence up beaconsfield road that went to about the gateway and we have the additional fence after that went from the gateway that was indented for the water trucks that goes up to the church the quote does does the quote include all those posts or does it only include the road and the first section along beaconsfield road i would have thought we might have more end posts and six is what it 's tweaked with me no through the chair that would probably i said would be the case so yes i 'd have to take that on those i think the numbers here would increase yes but i do know that in council apparel council accounts amendments if there is extra money there that would cover this should this be the case and i would also know that one of the staff had looked at a number of these post caps and they can vary quite dramatically in price and quality yes hundred dollars there will be a great advantage to the community group well okay sorry man and the snug fit when timber shrinks don 't become snug that 's why you need ones with holes for nails but anyway i 'll leave that at the expense okay i 'm putting the amendment council utilized part of our quantum village fund allocation for 2020 21 year to purchase and install caps on the new o 'connell recreation ground fence up to the value of two thousand five hundred dollars furthermore should this project under the current funding application yield any savings that the o 'connell village fund be reimbursed these monies for use in other upcoming local projects all in favor carry unanimously the amendment now becomes the motion all in favour of motion carried thank you if it 's too late to have a different goal is it there is councillors page 12 councillor and delegates reports 1101 central new south wales joint organization board meeting in reference to march 2021 recommendation is it report item is received as information could i have a mover please counselor callum thank you speak to this um just briefly madame um i attended that meeting and i found it particularly interesting in a number of uh areas particularly the presentation on wayne angular band and what 's happening there or what may not happen the communications aspect of this meeting was i thought a bit underwhelming it was a bunch of retail telcos talking about what they can do for you as long as you make a complaint and uh rather than telcos telling us what their strategy is for providing uh better telecommunications in the rural areas of australia um and it was yes i was quite disappointed with that side of it um but i recommend a report i know it 's pretty straightforward and i see you 're going to take us up with the local member about this um transport over the means thank you thank you thank you councilman thank you madame um several issues first of all um maybe i 'll the the y angler dam um have there been any further uh communications from central west waters whether they 've heard anything as to what 's um the communications forum um i spoke to mr joshua ford i think his name was at that meeting he took down notes of several issues i raised i 've heard nothing and i have emailed him three times since then to which no response has been forthcoming well i will tell you i 've also contacted this gentleman um inviting him to come out to operon talk to our community and our council and we 're in current negotiations as far as a date he 's agreed to come and we 're just going to set a date it doesn 't respond to emails he responded tomorrow well it 's obviously me and just following on for a third point um i didn 't sit here but council mccarthy mentioned the transport over the over the blue mountain um was it a new south wales farmers meeting the other day where the president the new south wales farmers new south wales um said they were pushing very strongly on the transporter and it was communicated that it had taken people eight after eight to ten hours to get over whites um bell 's line closed and and was acknowledged um he did ask the copy of the paper that we had sent on the relations of tunnels so the process has started i 'm not quite sure how far that would be just just while you 're on the one end of the damn thing it just we had the minister on tv the other night and it just shows you how annoyed they are when someone brought up the the thing only fills up four times in 20 years and that minister was it just went straight over it that there will be no real benefit there 's also another issue that um will probably hit the media very soon is that lake cow west largest inland lake new south wales is also a um a major um bird breeding area and um their concern is a very strong group up there made of um that the lifting the wall will um reduce or take additional flow if it 's available and that late cow may in fact not get any water which is a significant concern sorry the forward note the report on progressing result the resolve of the board regarding connecting you might recall the previous jo meeting in my report there was a yes i do remember that 's what that relates um could i also suggest and it follows on from the next the inland rail project the most common on the new south wales farmers that if the rail line between orange in particular and lithgow will have to be straightened at some stage in the future and we do not want another inland rail fiasco where they actually go to the land holders just before after they 've announced the project during the throws that they should be at least planning the route now and negotiating and putting some money to do that before they even get there ten years before the event so that they have a route and they 've negotiated with the land holders and come to an agreement rather than have the situation the inland rail where it 's all ended up being a very difficult situation because it 's all happened at the 11th hour thank you 're considering that business and tourism association meeting the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have someone to move that please councillor cable a secondary councilman kevin councillor cape will you speak to the reporter no thank you mayor of the report covers what happened no i think the um report speaks for itself and it 's plenty to say that um as a secretary um in the report it says here that um more cabins going into the park does that mean there 'll be less spaces for caravans obviously i would think so yeah that 's something the council might have to look at in the future it 's getting that way that there 's not many sites left over there for councillors with the recommendation thank you page 20 counsellors 1201 cta audit risk and improvement committee the recommendation is the report the receiver 's information can have a mover please counselor kellum thank you um it was reasonably routine um basically tidying up a number of issues along with um uh plot the final audit and risk management processes we 're risk committee one of the independent members presented a self-assessment form which we have taken and reshaped so that it reflects the terms of reference that we work under um it 's become apparent that the terms of reference have not been adhered to by the eric particularly well and that reflects a number of things but mostly what we want to do is get it back on track so that if we 've got terms of reference we stick to them and we run out meetings and the work flow to meet those terms that 's pretty straightforward it 's about looking at not just financial audits but performance audits and uh general policy issues and how well that policy suits the operations of our council council thank you madame um i would i 'm just wondering if the terms of reference and could be circulated to remind us as to what the uh the terms of reference are of eric um so we understand what policies um i 'm just question asking um in relation to this um i know the intro it 's in the page 23 the central coast council can circulate with councils for information um i think it 'd be interesting for council obama councillors to look at that as well just for information services we can obtain a copy of that so it is online but we can circulate okay or a link to the wherever it is um i also note um i 'm just questioning in relation to risk reporting et cetera it deals quite lot about the audit what 's what 's happening in relation to the risk management procedures as they 've been that 's being reviewed by the audit committee i understand it is um at the moment the process for us has been the risk appetite workshops that were done six weeks ago uh as part of that process so we understand that the risk appetite is across broad range of activities which cancel out the facts and that will then go into our risk management policy and process and is that going to be circulating it will be likely that it will have to be ratified by through the chair it will be a program that months i realize it will be involved just becoming any other comments on this one put the recommendation all in favor thank you page 29 councillors two local emergency management committee recommendation is that there is a local emergency management meeting held on the 8th of february 2021 i received this information could i have a movement please councilman given a second to very comprehensive minutes um i don 't have anything to add any comments on this one councillors just one comment on the blockage at hand we 're still having people asking when they 'll be open and do we have any any knowledge of that not a certain knowledge now at this point we 've got to go the only other one thank you councilman any other comments with the recommendation within partner thank you age 33 councillors i 'd report for decision item 1301 tender for the supply and lay of new asphalt asheville overall street tender 2021-6 the recommendation is that council nominate the open open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 166a of the local government regulation 2005 for the supply and and stratfor strathright avenue t2021 stroke six that council at the conclusion of the tender period a report be provided at the may ordinary council meeting for a selection of certainly qualified for a selection of suitably qualified companies to be engaged and i have a mover please councillor givens a segment of please councillor capel thank you how 's the giveaway yes the recommendation is just the standard procedure and the costing exceeds 250 000. thank you all very straightforward very standard thank you kevin think about that i thought we already had a company engaged or we went up to tender um in an earlier meeting this year i think the current um supply was was fulton hogan wasn 't so we going out separately for asphalt outside that uh contender because we we have we tend to for asheville under the jr for putting for provision and laying of asheville haven 't we through the tube they do bitumen spraying is that the difference yeah it 's a spray butcherman seal through hogan the carton contractor where asheville obviously will provide that service but we don 't it 's a separate it would be a separate contract so we don 't have anyone providing asphalt generally through the chair we don 't normally have an expenditure that would require us um off this size or capacity so this being a one-off project of the size of up to half a million dollars then it 's a yeah specifically i understand thank you 1302 led street program southern lights the recommendation is that council approved the allocation of 219 000 to fund the essential energy led street lighting replacement project within the 2021-22 operational plan and allocate a portion of the projected annual savings of 40 000 to fund the installation of additional street lights where current gaps and deficiencies exist through future operational plans do i have a move on councilman councilman cable thank you councilman technically do you wish to speak to this yes i support the recommendation um on on several of the grounds there that um that we 're going to get significant savings in our return on our funds over a little over five years um but the upgrade to that will give all our streets and also support that we 've had a supporting on the grounds that we 've had the independent company have a look and uh assess what we already have in the areas for improvement and some areas where we like these moments lighting so there should be some good gains for us there cost wise ongoing and some benefits all around for the community and safety and motor vehicle safety pedestrian safety by our walking groups and what have you so yeah i think it 's um well well worth the uh the project go ahead fully supported thank you councilman we 've got here a project to upgrade out-of-date uh lighting and in doing so increasing safety uh around the town um for the community and generally improving the town amenity and and doing so um with a saving in costs and uh i note that um here in the um um that we the cost of funds is lower than the cost of the funds allowed by essential entities so it 's a no-brainer basically to uh to pay the uh the amount of money borrowing money on bank card so i think i fully support the move and i think it will be a great thing for the community the project actually supplies us with new lighting booms new lights and controllers and once that 's installed the electrical supply circling no cost to us that 's right so we pay the capital costs then they own them and i know it 's a wonderful system we have here in australia isn 't it um what i would like is uh through you madame general manager can you explain why in the table on page 36 if we 're looking at a figure of 219 thousand dollars uh as a capital cost to us the cost of the upgrades down to 302 000 and the net capital cost of council is 209 000. um through the chair it will go to assist in the other upgrades that we do that have been proposed as part of the report um it will also help and assist in getting that first part moving along so the 209 000 is the original replacement under the luminaries the that we need to do as part of this project so that 's one two three four on page thirty six and thirty seven that 's correct the other great counselor sorry i 'm madam i 'm still a little confused on that because we have on the table on page 36 we have cost of upgrade 302 316. residual value of lights being replaced right here while 618. 81. 81. total capital cost to council we get to 232 and net capital cost so we get esc credits from new south wales if we do this do we that 's 23 000 correct so how did we get from the 302 to the 232 i 'm through the chair welcome to southern watts what does that mean okay so there 's part so this this probably sends to councillor mckibben 's um original question about what is the southern lights program and how can we do it the whole purpose of southern lights was a mass production or a mass payment for luminaries if oh okay so because we 've joined with everyone else correct there is a substantial so and i understand now the ownership concept where we pay the money but really don 't own the asset it goes to as soon as we pay the money basically become and it 's purchased it becomes an asset of essential energy which is interesting but i suppose that means we don 't have to maintain uh student payments we also don 't get the benefit of any depreciation or anything else on it through the chair much to the pleasure of my director of corporate services tomorrow so the 209 000 yep we are allocating for this project where is it coming from so through the chair as as it 's indicated in this report are we going to bring as part of a general um allocation out of the 2122 operation point 21 21-22 correct okay so i 'll be in the 21-2 racial plan so when we do the next amendment to the operational plan we will have to include this or is it included already as a budget as part of this we can 't_''_4828.8 do that until you move on whether you want to through the essential energy process and get the limited refund so once council has determined which way they want to go we will then include it accordingly in our operational plan or draft operational plan for 2122. so can i ask through you 've had a mayor the 2021-22 operational plan and our budget for next year can accommodate this expenditure um through the chair yes we are have within current budgeting process within our accounting process we can 't accommodate it okay all right on that basis i 'm prepared to support it thank you any other comments counselor don 't you thank you mr man um local businesses have been interesting and asking about this for some time so it 's good to see coming around um i take council mckibben 's point that was uh exactly what i was wondering myself as to what pressure this is putting on our resources in our next budgeting process but i 've also draw attention to 0.2 on the top of page 36 to me if i 'm reading that right it suggests that um we can either borrow or 're examining the impact of the 200 000 but i 'm very pleased to hear stuff say they think they can accommodate that two hundred thousand into the into the budget possibility as it stands um one other i 'm just concerned about the time frame on the maintenance on these led lights if they become faulty i think we should have a rumor with uh central energy that they get repaired within 48 hours to be honest if you 've got a led light to strobin on and off on and off it sends your bloody crazy so part of this we must have an agreement at the moment it takes i think the lights out on the top of the roundabout coming into over and we 're out and it took essentially i think 10 weeks to repair that 's and it was logged we rung the lady back they weren 't all there but they 're running the lady back they 're logged but we need to have an understanding how long it 's going to take to repair these things a little up the warranty would sure the general manager will make that come so thank you mccarthy and it 's obviously an operational issue but it may be a service level agreement required as a to say yes we 're prepared to go ahead potential energy under service level agreement with the basis of fixing lights within 48 hours and if they don 't and we get a reduction in tariff or something to incentivize them to do it through the chair i don 't know how well the person who owns runs and then asks us to pay for their equipment we 'll handle that but i 'm more than have to ask the question we 're paying for their equipment we also have obligations to do so okay counselors i 'm going to put the recommendation all in favor apparently thank you age 38 councillors 1303 return of watercards the recommendation is that council provide an extension of one month for all outstanding water cars to be returned and that in that time final letters be issued to water card holders outlining that if the card is not returned by 28th of may please council mccarthy thank you in a second dr johnny thank you wish to speak to this councilman mccarthy that 's pretty straightforward thank you just one thing do we um do we have and should we uh contact these last 60 people do we have a simple means through the chair we have the availability here just to say let 's close us down here sort of through the chair we haven 't done it before it 's a simple process of now can we consider that that 's right ginger isn 't it any other comments counselors for the recommendations page 39 councillors 1304 black springs community hall gathering repair the recommendation is the council approves twenty three thousand dollars transfer from the work construction restricted fund for repairs to the black springs community called guttering and fashion boards and i have a mover please councillor givens thank you a second of course on the cuban thank you council given as you wish to speak to i actually witnessed the heavy rains there a few weeks back with the contractors that were working in the hall it was inside the main wall and doing damage right into the meeting room and uh response to corporate service community services they 've done a great job in uh responding to what was an issue that 's probably been going on for a while but none of us realized until you get a big lot of rain and you can see the snow straps not working [Music] and they 've allowed the rain to come off the main roof down onto the skillion roof through spaces and dispersing the water more evenly and it 's got the other side to do and they 're going to do it very quickly but that that 's a great effort so i 'd have to support this uh and i see we have 328 thousand dollars there for building maintenance job well done thank you councilman councilman i think about him he has obviously a necessary repair um it has to be done so well do i understand from council given some the work 's already been done right okay fine any other comments from this one councillors mccarthy um yeah it says the timber again isn 't there a uh monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that the report item is received as information and i have a murder place councilman kevin and the second council journey thank you speak to this thank you madam um i know the i think the science strategy is just about complete now if it 's not completed i think it is complete um the only thing i 'd say is that i noticed orange is some sign that you come up from the highway the other day actually is probably the upstages it seems to light up and then it changes color from green to orange to red or i think it is it 's like going colorblind [Laughter] um excellent report um i commend the report um so um i know that there 's quite a considerable amount of training um it has been organized for staff on page 43 which is good to see um and that we 've been um successful in our recruitment drive and paragraph a on page 43 so i 'd commend the report to you i i verses and tourism how much impact physically has the closure of janelle and cave had on the tourism in oberon and through through the chair and we 're still seeing quite a bit of tourism in and around there i 'm sure it 's had an impact um we haven 't done the stats for that at this point in time but certainly i would suspect that the amount of events that we 're putting on this time is trying to get visitors into the region and i think it 's working there have been a couple of comments by people that i don 't know what 's happened but they 've obviously either missed the signs from this direction or that direction and they 've actually ended up on the genealogy road and not realised until i got their hand they did at one stage have the barriers across at hartley but they 've been removed they 're just a sign there at the moment um someone was traveling from barrigan that actually didn 't realize it was closed until they got to that side of over for the just looking on page 43 a couple of two key things um under recruitment two offices started successfully yesterday positions correct that correct the chief financial officer of the technical services administrative system yep it 's good and the total in employee statistics as you 've noted it fluctuates based on hours and that 's a total based on full equipped full-time equivalent yes yes and our full time actually still sits at about 67. um sorry i think we need some more to do all the work otherwise uh thank you for the report most informative professor people think about it just um highlighting i just reminded me about uh you know the the impact on the genome that the knowledge pleasure has had obviously it has had a an impact on since the beginning of easter until now accommodation is unavailable in oberon every night um mayfield garden has been absolutely hectic down there every day we actually were down there with friends on i think it was last thursday we decided we thought we 'd go to the cafe for a coffee at about 10 o 'clock until half past two and so you know it 's been it 's been solid down there every day there 's no accommodation in town um and i think the job that the um the tourism and economic development department has had has been been fantastic and you know like it 's highlighted in here the write-ups reports in various media organizations and i 'm also pleased to see that um oberon has been nominated for the top tourism town this year so i think really is oberon 's really traveling very well and i think we 're probably lucky about where we are it 's unfortunate that jenelle and caves is going through the issues that they are but um we might do anyway but in february and march there were no injuries at all so i think that reflects very well on your work health and safety team and the broader workforce and their commitment to safety yeah just on tourism again for your information the burger statistician says there was a hundred vehicles an hour going into the abercrombie national park out there during the early days have fitted another caravan in there so people are finding a lot more to do around our area didn 't just go to the cave you ring you at 9 30 at night it 's just just a couple mechanic this replaces a retired staff member correct thank you um the management agreement with the um people that run the swim pool does that mean that we now have the shortened season for the swiss building so it 's gone back to what it was originally thank you and um the sign on that 's been damaged on the duck molly road so that 's kind of our insurances yes through the chair right through the chair that 's the way that we will connect with them okay thank you recommendations page 46 counselors item 1402 monthly activity report planning and development the recommendation is that the report is received as information can i have someone to move that please counseling and a second thank you thanks for careful thank you kevin do you wish to speak to them uh thinking about a man uh yes um detailed report um noted somewhere else that the independent living units at least one report we would expect next month in our main papers is that correct through the chair that 's the expectation yes um and on the indel fitness center have we got to close out report on that um through the chair it 'll be done at the same time mate yep so both mate and there 'll be a separate report two reports i assume on the independent living units we 'll get both of that um through the chair if the execution has been provided to me yes right but we 'll at least get one okay apart from that um the only other question is um um i can 't recall it may have been dealt with when we dealt with the um issue of the tip and the notice of motion that arises that report that 's to come into the future it may be dealt with in that report but in relation to the pound when is that actually going to be transferred up to the proximity of the tip um [Music] do you want the sorry the pound the dot the the it 's always been envisaged that the pound will be moved from where it currently is to the tip to allow for the new stp i think yes correct that that is correct and we 're working towards a project where we can get the finalization of that developed and is that starting funding through the chair that has been funded that has that 's what i thought and it takes account of water and electricity needs yes uh yes solar electricity solar electricity and water tank yes okay um so three we have today we need to do it in accordance with the companion animals legislation and there is some things that need to be dealt with in that regard definitely needs water definitely needs all the provisions of is the tank going to be providing enough water and we 'll make sure the tech provides enough water so any date are we looking at this year or next um as soon as possible to perfectly honest with your counsellor because i want the stp clear and ready for instant startup asking the question um so i 'm just wondering we have a schedule for it um as soon as possible right fine thank you madame thank you oh thank you man i just this report is is also like that like proves an indication of how um we over on the highlights it there i think things are really bolting along in in this area and i can see that the planning and development director is is earning his coupe in this place um just a couple of things um through you madame is our expectation at the moment eight weeks turn around for a day through the chair that 's great council yes is okay so we can 't get any more help to make it a bit quicker through the chair we do have help one day a week at the moment so we 're doing our best to i i realize that that 's a local person there 's no one outside that shorten the backlog i 'll take that on notice okay thank you and i 've been told it 's in your ball court the for six months i know you haven 't_''_6009.76 been there that long but when are we to see the um carpools down at the street um self-care units in respect that we 've got frosts occurring now and it 's just taken away from the building side of it one that so the council 's seen more value and do it themselves but where are they thank you through the chair the with the finalization of the report coming uh we need to check the budget i 'm sure there 's money left for the uh to undertake the carport at noon so we 'll have a look at that i 'll take it on notice as well come back i don 't understand how you got a little bit of budget to do it there was money provided in the funds why isn 't it but in action that 's what i can understand i 'm through through the chair just to give damian some help because he 's new on the on the ball that that has been the application has been submitted to the shed company to project it 's a matter of getting damien up speed on progressing that as soon as we can okay i 'll come back to when we poured the slab surely goodness did we engage someone at that stage to put the cardboards up because i remember you coming down there at december yep we should have been doing that then so that we shouldn 't be in winter putting carpools up to protect the people 's cars that 's all i 'm getting there surely goodness is a part of the thing we took it away from the builder to do it so i just can 't see why it 's been done through the chair a number of things have happened in that space that you 're well aware of is the reason why we didn 't do it the gas number of issues that we had with contractors and dealing with that with the construction of the units um it was it was considered that the carport should be one of the last things that we do because we 've taken ownership or control of that matter okay inspections do we do those do you really do those in concert [Music] through the chair that hasn 't been a cycle because covered there was a decision made not to to have a burden on food owners and that was across the board in in terms of local government um the mayor is correct in a statement we generally provide a contractor who comes in and does it as a cost recovery process so there is some independence around that because food handling is generally very a motive to say to say the least and um it 's the best way to deal with it when you need to action something like that and when is there likely to be another i appreciate that you know people are get coming back into establishments yep other than just pure take away when is the next intended or likely cycle of inspections so they buy annual are they are there an annual inspection and we 'll look at renewing that probably in the new financial year 1403 monthly activity report technical services recommendation there is the safest information can i have have a second to please counsel helen thank you thanks for giving us your wish before yeah just wondering how technical services are going with it all we 've got so many things happening prepare grant funding safer roads program fixing local roads maintenance grading our own road and natural disasters no events and right down to the rms doing work on our state roads just a bit of a review of how they 're coping with it and we 're on budget and on a timeline how 's it going i just feel it 's been a really busy time and the weather 's been reasonable but uh just a bit of a report on that um through the chair look certainly it 's been a busy time um prioritization i think is really the key thing with our internal resources and then complementing that with uh the assistance of external contractors so again we will continue down that path with the busy schedule ahead whilst we still are on cameras of a road and the like this is one of the larger projects you 've quite cognizant of will see us into winter and including i suppose the maintenance program which we 've uh we can 't discount the fact that we need to maintain our concealed road network and all um yes i mean staff have certainly been stretched but we are continuing to do recruitment as required to fill the creators and rollers down a bit they 're just going to have to wait a bit longer until they 're all scheduled uh you 're through this year but certainly on a priority basis there um overseas or overseas are getting around and reviewing those those issues and then prioritizing thank you thank you councilman technical services particularly busy with roads and water and sewage and everything else and i think the workforce has done a great job i just have one question uh status of the training for our new exploration plan operator are you for the chair um at this point the operators are well advanced in their their training um they 're expected to be um fully accredited here early may so that will then allow us then to have our own internal thank you thank you councilman that 's mccarthy um on page 52 and it shows that we 're going to do the flip part of scotia avenue um there 's a lot of old poles there and i was just wondering where to consider that we could put a conduit underneath the footpath to out to say the curtain gutter in anticipation that we take some undergrounding on there in the future there 's some of the services that are already underground by the owners right out and it 's only the old poles that are in that street i think there 's about 14 of them but it 's just something that we might take on notice that we 're going to be doing earthworks to get the footpath done we can consider that that is there any chance of putting a bit of grassy down on some as you 've seen the slippage and all that from general case comes back from not having matter like you take the beta throat you 've done a lot of road works out there there 's a lot of raw material keep it together with wind coming on that 's all right yeah through the chair generally the guys do put suit out but i will not take that on those thank you maybe um yeah and you can only commend the um parks and gardens staff they 're doing a fantastic job they 're the short staff they 've got someone filling into doing the boiler cleaning and staying away from the parks and gardens to monitor the tip taken away from parks and gardens so um yeah and it 's good to see that last week they completed warrior lane apparently this is a good result thank you councilman um just noting the um the grant that uh comes up obviously on granson has been announced for cat for burger and archstone roads um is it intended to fix the slippage on bull hill that 's on the burriga road near the mount david turn off um with some of the money that 's received under that grant is there a timing on this because it has been slippage has been in place for six months now yes through just here recently in relation to that um the intention is to have that fixed uh under the general fund it might it doesn 't then wait for using local road stage two funding the anticipated time frame is in with the next two to three weeks to get a start the slumping in the material we 've sort of been waiting for it to dry out because it is quite i suppose moving all the time um and getting a machine in there also is obviously in this steep and been been quite a challenge i think in terms of taking that work on but in the next two to three weeks we 're hoping to get a start and have that completed certainly during my stage and we 're satisfied that the solution proposed is going to solve the problem nothing has happened before uh india through the tune that 's the anticipation that the fix will be the resolve so uh it 's really getting the sheep water from the road to a controlled state where it can get off i think uh and not be concentrated on the embankment um just if i could uh reference um something that council mccarthy said um when we 're using uh seed on the road verges where we 're talking about putting seed can we please not use any type of log grass because it 's all very hard to distinguish from african love grass which is a obnoxious wheat it 's a priority one way rms has been using is very hard to distinguish from that love grass um and our inspectors are having particular difficulties in distinguishing the two so please don 't use a love grass variety um i i too would commend uh the director of technical services spend a lot of work on and a lot of work to come and there 's been a lot of work on the parks and gardens thank you thank you um i 've just noticed on page 53 that was a big subdivision jobs at the moment the titanium at the state and the fracking planning state various on-site meetings i 'm just wondering if there 's there 's no substantive issues through madame to the general the developer and their consultant in relation to uh planning for design and work works as part of the dna process so that 's pretty much what that onsite meeting was about thank you madam mayor and also um you know i suppose there 's been some meetings when the technical services got an absolute hammering but they 're looking pretty good today the anzac avenue and o 'connell looks absolutely schmick the recreation ground looks terrific and uh warrago lane is getting um much praise and pleasure from the residents for saying how good it 's looking just regard counsel that in the future maybe we make sure we 're just not the ones who pay for it next time but uh it 's looking good down here court corporate services the recommendation is that reporters receive this information could i have someone to move that councillor kellen thank you a secondary president thank you mr speaker um it 's been i know it 's been a busy week for all the directors for busy months and i particularly noted the great effort that the corporate services director and uh youth week and i think it was much appreciated by anyone who had anything to do with those those two uh activities so it was excellent work um i noticed the advertisement this morning for a new library manager i assume that um astrid has decided it 's time to retire and that 's that 's sad because i think she 's been a very very very fine library manager you bought a new car in the paradigm oh she 's off listen um um thank you madame um i was just um wanting a comment because i don 't see it reported here and i don 't think it 's in the status of resolutions as to where we are with the ems so through the chair the ems working party mets last week and put a recommendation to the emt their preferred pro their preferred provider it will be open office so we 'll be moving to we will start the process to transition it will be an 18 month to two year process to move the whole organization over but that process has started okay so could matter man just look forward to cancel applause good um if i could just on the next if you 're on page 55 which is finance um so i 'm assuming that the proposal for the hub stage two and we have appointed a project manager is we 're going to be asking for a final design and construction contract are we asking for a we 're going out to an rft for the final design and then a separate rft for construction through the chair um the tender for the final design is out now and then we 're looking to put the the tender out for construction by june request pretending yes right okay so it 'll be two separate can can the is it is it wise to issue the rft the construction until we have the final design in hand um through the chair we 're hoping that um they 'll go hand in hand so the timing will be the design will come through and then we 'll be able to put the request for construction out okay so we 'll have the actual construction that 's right i didn 't think that could do the zones and we 'll and when the detail design comes back council will have an opportunity to look at that fire would actually be part of the rft for the construction that 's correct that 's correct okay i just wanted to make get the staging correct i 'm staging my mind correct okay thank you very much at least a second the and i um again i think the ins and outs on the table on um page 56 botany boom they 'd be really good to see how it 's going [Music] and services not again i always uh i 'm very proud of bill bray the council provides some low-cost accommodation i think that 's sort of a fine thing we do um uh and i 'll just draw a reference to i noticed in an email that related to this in the seniors week that the lifeline session tomorrow was called off to participants who cheered the um session yesterday yesterday yesterday um i noticed we we had lifeline present in o 'connell last but if you have not been to this introductory one they do that if you get the opportunity to go and do it i had uh i thought it was very worthwhile and pushed for it to occur but i had a little bit of healthy skepticism but i left with that thoroughly gone it was very informative and and very useful i can only recommend counsellors in their roles in the community that they take the opportunity to do that course with lifeline it was just it was a two-hour introductory um but i felt it was extremely helpful any other comments from this one i 'll put the recommendation on this data here page 60 councillors ip 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is that council receive report item 1405 information the police counsellors counselor thank you customer card council killing mr speak to the report uh just briefly um once again the interest rates are making life a bit more interesting that needs to be for us i think we probably need to think about looking again at the restrictions we put on our financial investments last when we did that and we are now in a much more certain space mccarthy yes oh the firm belief that uh bank governor philip lowe got it wrong the interest shouldn 't have been dropped as uh so low and as you see that with the property market starting to turn the corner in some places um some of the places going up is two percent per month and um there wasn 't a place in sydney tonight that made over two million dollars and prior to that 18 months ago it 's all for 1.57 so yeah i i think they 've got it wrong going so low but anyway you can 't_''_7260.88 do much about if you 're only one i 'll make next door i think i 'd appreciate it going up as well any other comments on this one councilman with the recommendation all in favor all your favorite counsellors harry thank you 363 councillors 1406 grants monthly update the recommendation is the report item which receives this information can i have a murder please counselor kevin under secretary clinton thank you councilman thank you was going to ask is on page 63 with the grant uh successful grant application for axton and variga rhodes uh will that now make arkansas and barrigan road suitable for b doubles within that that part of burrica road that 's within the oberon shire or local council area through the tube possibly will increase the ability to review that on that basis well well in undertaking the works will we have will we be cognizant of the fact that the road could or would in future be suitable for b doubles uh yeah through the chair again yes i look i believe it depending on what capacity uh b that is but uh certainly it would certainly favor b doubles so once campbell 's river road is done arc stone road burrica road will that allow b doubles to go on all those roads through the cheers but i i don 't see why i wouldn 't so council would be supporting that that would be up to council i i realize that but the one of the things is the road has to be a suitable quality isn 't it who approves it to to actually approve it and council has to give a letter recommending it um so what i 'm asking is basically spending all this money on these roads are they going to be to a standard that council could recommend that they would be suitable for b-double so through the chair if the second paragraph on that thing basically says exactly that well does it it says understand the support to support safe and high-performance vehicles are not necessary i don 't think logging trucks it doesn 't say b double stop trucks and there 's there 's two different there 's various various variations of hpv 's and b doubles and there 's a stock i 'm talking about certain certain logging trucks are as i understand this correctly technical services director of a standard like a b double but there are obviously stock trucks as well certain forestry trucks fall below the b double um but certain forestry tracks that come into it but i 'm not sure where the criteria falls yeah through this year certainly mentioning capacity types have but again it will be on merit uh in terms of what is being proposed before uh you know council and hvr as well as the national heavy vehicle regulator which comes to us um to to make uh that assessment at that time but yes it would support b doubles just cognitive of committing to what capacity that 's all because there 's so many different types that you 've mentioned so the current campus river crossing i would have thought wouldn 't have been a difficult area for b doubles maybe with its upgrade with that support available through the chair i don 't see why it wouldn 't support b doubles okay not i 'm not talking about the new via doctor we 're still looking for grant clinton okay thank you that 's um i would commend this report madam mayor thank you it 's now an eight metre road just through the technical services this new grant has just come through that 'll be an eighth note of sale with will it uh through the chair certainly we 're looking to support what we can eight minute correction so that 's going to lead from the campus river road into the village and then beyond on the counter going back along the arc down road from the campbell 's river yeah through the chair would be the uh the supporting group would be back through barrigan via campbell 's in the road just a clarification so if b double gets supported down fast um out of borrower down towards the van david way then does that mean that the mill doesn 't have to comply with the access like the mill have applied for um b double access before they 're being knocked back because it 's not suitable where it is but once it 's approved past there they automatically can come on board [Music] for the chair that if that were to be the case that would permit them yes in that circumstance but yes again we 'd have to look at what they 're involved from the origin to the destination i suppose is the what we need to review if they can 't kind of go west towards rocky and then right so it 's supporting it via cameras with the road again abercrombie and we 'll mess back to the easter eggs but now now once this comes available they don 't have to do that i through the chair they 'd certainly still have to make permit to be able to do you know certainly whatever their business activity is so that again for the nhvr that 's where they would make application and to count through and back through to council for review and permit if that be the case well my understanding is out on the abercrombie road an applicant there and they had to move the and after akira went out and look or whatever they call themselves today and they had to move the gateway again depending on where they 're accessing the road i suppose those types of things need to be reviewed so as part of that application that 's what would recommendation is that the reporter 's receiver 's information can i have someone to read that does the cable thank you councilman teller would you like to speak to the report up to a respectable level um i do have a question for the technical services director on the um um that 28 thousand kilometres going through in the last week of march was that overflow from storm water but i 'm super has to be actually through the g i guess the plant did experience some stormwater infiltration and that does indicate that certainly there are possibly a number of connections or legal connections perhaps we are looking at a program that will be looking at trying to uh track down where they go that 's my testing question that 's great yeah because it 's extraordinary that 's four times a normal week so and did did the syrian troop plan despite its decrepit age survive okay with all that that amount uh yeah through the chair it did handle quite well um considering you know considering the extensive waveform that we had yes okay [Music] nothing really made america or something less time 44 is close enough yeah so that 's great yeah thank you 44.6 22nd to the 31st that water consumption 1408 a local government elections 's information can i have someone to move that please councillor cable thank you and a second to please councilman thank you councillor cable if you wish to speak to them well thank you just for information would you like to report no it is what it is any other comments on this one counsellors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor sharon thank you 73 councillors 1409 monthly updates status of council resolutions the recommendation is the report item is received as information can i have a mover please it 's been going since 2018 um have we put the survey eggs in on the forms out there how much room top rocks right yes number six right for a few years certainly we have identified the site we you know where it is okay can we hand the rest of the information over to our local member and get him to do something yeah let 's finalize surely goodness the land 's board and that we we should be able to get this all finalized yes through the chair it 's done done i thought all right getting rid of the items [Music] because i was going to congratulate him sorry so i was just well great significance i just noticed the second last one is the purchase of those traffic on mobile you know mobile traffic lights and those sorts of pictures in intense use in other countries rather than stop go that we spend a lot of money on and uh even all of a sudden they 're um they 're all around the central west too it 's good to see it 's a good savings and i think that getting away from the traffic control services which were extremely expensive sorry i 'm raising something that was raised about the traffic my only question is i wasn 't_''_8092.8 at the works committee meeting as i had to depart rather rapidly to try to unbox a truck my question on this traffic lights thing my only question on this is that i think they 're great but of all the traffic lights i have seen recently whether it 's on hampton roads oh sorry was it it 's whether it 's on janelle and have the traffic lights but we still have two people sitting in a truck to make sure they work to make sure they work and i 'm wondering the labor saving i really would love to see something about labor saving because every time i see these traffic lights i think what a great idea but then i see the two people in the truck sitting there rather than one person going stop go and now they seem to be playing on their phone so i just questioned are we getting a real liver saving oh yeah through the chair certainly we are getting a labor saving i mean transport for new south wales has different regulations and requirements on their road network as opposed to how we need to operate again we still have our traffic management plans and traffic control plans but again if we 're working on a transport for new south wales worksite we will be burdened by certainly their regulations but again in our circumstances where we 've got these large works projects and multiple activities i think it will be certainly a saving in so if we go through over on roads and we suddenly see two people sitting in a vehicle and we 've got this top go i should be coming back to you and saying okay through strength send yourselves right through through the chair if it 's on if it 's on evergreen o 'connell or duck or director as indicated abercrombie is a regional road as well so there could be some restrictions on him but yeah so there 's different horses for different courses thank you for clarifying that the contractors are putting up the railings on the abercrombie road they have these new super traffic lights like we 're getting with the counting down the numbers so and that 's really good because you can get your engine ripping [Laughter] so there 's no hold ups at all thank you council anything else tell us before i put the recommendations this evening item 16 closed session confidential report accordance with the local government act 1993 and the local government general regulation 2005 in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kind as and should be dealt with in part of the meeting close to the media and close to the public i 'd like to thank the members of the public for joining us at this evening 's meeting and and presumed meeting thank you for coming good night thank you i now call for a counsellor to move the council will move into post session please councilman kevin and the second we just have just some silence while we the following resolutions were made in session and there were no members of the public present at the time item 1602 that council do not refund was water usage for assessment one two three six one zero nine one as outlined in a report the next ordinary meeting of overall council will be held on tuesday may 18 2021 commencing at 5 30 p.m i declare the meeting closed at 7 56 pm and wish you all a good night thank you councillors _"

Shah and his commitment to find out who is responsible for any health issues arising from fluoridation and get back to Council you refuse to follow up on a commitment why why would you refuse to follow up such month you continue to say you 've answered my questions when indeed you have not I 've decided style include you know you 're in attica replies to my emails in your to email replies to my questions regarding one the fake SRC poll and to dr. Shanthi regarding the health issues of fluoride you merely stay that I should contact the state government or the SRC pollsters what a joke you know very well that would go nowhere as if anyone would consider that a satisfactory answer from the men those who had not those who are not satisfactory areas from the mayor ought to care about the health and well-being of oberon residents so I 'm saying it again based on the inadequate answers you 've given me so far you have no interest in what the residents have over on what all fees by asking all councils to read the attached documents which they have because you 're leaving yourself open to be sued if your fluid ate Oberon 's water supply thank you and having responded to mr. Haines on two prior occasions I have got second question is from Gregg infants on behalf of the OSR and RA the general manager and Corporate Services Director when it 's AfriNIC reports CCTV data will be made available directly for police accessing video footage from the police station or a mobile device in a secure cloud drive can the council police show cause that section 62 one of the privacy and personal information protection act 1998 are adhere to and that this proposed changed by the corporate services director complies with the PP IP act in terms of monitoring evaluation and oddity of counsels activities OS r r a support the rightful use of CCTV can the council please advise where the independent 12 monthly CCTV audits can be found for residents to view in accordance with the New South Wales Justice Department and the second query is council the general manager and the tech services director Chris Schumacher 's reports the water consumption in week 20 to 31st of May increased by 40 percent compared to previous weeks did the incoming raw water burst pipe contribute to this what caused the pipe and how long was connection in the wastewater treatment volume increasing but in the same week by a hundred percent that is doubling Thank You general manager I 'm taking that one or notice have you taken notice thank you the third one is the president of the OS R R a and the question relates to the tech services directors reports for the O 'Connell ball is operational with the excess remaining in a natural state until the rec ground designs have been done in September 19 the council advised 161 project having suffered an over expenditure of 100 1000 with a further 80 required to complete the outstanding works including security fencing and all-weather road access significant costs were incurred after approving 130,000 under Section 94 and 52,000 from works construction in October 19 yet the project is still incomplete the question is what is a total cost year-to-date for this project until when will the original scope of work be completed councils may wish to explore this topic further 1403 community members would like to be informed given delays cost overruns and short deliveries thank you for joining manager as this notice yes but a man thank you for the 4th query has come from six omec and he is speaking on his own behalf he indicates some background and that background the general manager reports today these finalizing the MOU for Borg 's in relation to the Oberon Sports Complex the council claims that the matters within the MOU are confidential and only dealt with in closed session there are only two parties to the negotiations there is no commercial third party that possibly could be in a position to take advantage of any knowledge it may obtain from the get from the negotiating process the subject matter can only be relevant to counsel and Bourg and importantly to the abram community none of the conditions for confidentiality under the Local Government Act section 10 a e2 c and d can possibly apply concerns have been raised by the community about one the benefit of the community of the overall come conception and the proposition being discussed between Borges and council to the balance of the value of land and facilities to be given up and the value of the of the dough which allegedly will make council dependent on board for financial contribution to finalize the project at a future time where project overruns and other unforeseen risk factors made me do field for council to exercise its rights I 'm another contract Borg is by far the largest single employer in Oberon and is a major part of the community Abram does not have the luxury of a local industry with many large independent players it is no secret that such a situation can be unbalanced and make commercial negotiations difficult this also applies to any future contract disputes it is all the more reason for council to strengthen its hands involve the overall community the only other player in the issue who whose interests are vital and at stake the questions for the man does the council intend to discuss in open council a closed session the draft MOU before it is approved if no council discussions were not if the answer the question one is in closed session please let me know what the specifics are which will enable council to claim confidentiality and also under explain why Council believes its reason override the community strong right to know there are legal precedence in this area as I understand it three any in any event to make formal request here I 'll make formal request here and at council make public the draft MOU private to a being signed with Borges I ask them here to confirm that the motion will be brought forward so that the council in session will formally be able to consider releasing the draft prior to signing the document thank you items that are deemed confidential under the actor classified as such by the general manager and in accordance with the Act I defer these questions to the general manager for a response and this will be taken now on notice thank you they here the fifth question is comes from Veronica 's sister and she acts on her own volition I would like to do I would like to see the Loeb bridge on a Braun Street on the east side of town between the tram motel on the other so they may say I 've been in council meetings we need to bring being made safe it is clearly not wide enough to accommodate traffic safely as well as the fact the road bends at a bridge adds to the dangerous nature of this bridge in inclement weather is even more dangerous which I 've experienced firsthand in addition to the road bridge on Edith road towards genomic aids needs to be widened I 've traveled this bridge every time we go to town and although it is designated a to a bridge it really shouldn 't be there have been several occasions where I pulled over to allow light to allow large semi trailers to pass as there is barely a millimeter gap if we occupy the bridge together the reason why I 'd like to see both these bridges remedy is a council is that as council pushes on whether it 's in campaign to increase tourism in the area these infrastructure issues only get more pressing just Nikki if a tragedy happen on a tour and a tourist was involved in on involved on one of these bridges and how that would impact on the reputation venues and halls but what about the suffering of basic infrastructure okay I 'd like to thank Monica for her comment and know that there has been some work done around these issues council will take this on notice and provide a response they hear the final the final question comes from a highly dry hand the matter man I asked I am asking his resident of our on the draft suite of plans deserves various questions regarding more detailed studies after changes to Accounting Standards in 1920 is not clear to me the documents presented from now from now from now on future income is declared when the project is finished not when the funds are received a ASB 15 note 3 where green income arises from an agreement which is enforceable and contains sufficient sufficient specific performance obligations then the revenue is recognized when control of each performance obligation is satisfied the income statement shows the council expects Quebec grants in a corner in the order of nine point four million eight point seven extra compared to 1921 is it correct that council anticipates all nine point four answer was in the affirmative does a 2021 operating plan comply with a SBS ie the IASB 15 intentions three with a new set of plans have to be prepared for the public to review and comment should this figure of 9.4 not be compliant with a ASB 15 for other expenses of increased by over a million what cost-saving measures has this council identified evidently a 50% cost increase is outrageous after covert five police provide a breakdown of materials and contracts employee benefits and borrowing costs akin to other expenses to make the plan figures Prince parent why the borrowings cost one hundred twenty three thousand four hundred and six dollars the same in two years and what are they for Thank You general manager I 'll refer this to the general manager and I assume you will take this one on

investment investment policy 2 2 1 1 review there is a recommendation there counselors but the Director of Corporate Services has asked if she could give a brief overview before I call for a mover of that recommendation thank you madam I would just like to confirm that what the aim of this policy was while staff were continuing to abide by Local Government Act and the code of accounting practice and financial reporting and investment policy guidelines we wanted to ensure that with limited risk we were diversifying our investments protecting our counsels capital as well as continuing to support community-based institutions within our region pulling away from local based institutions long ago is not commercially based and yes we some of us would like to be that to happen but counsel would be moving away from their core identity which is supporting the community his policy proposes that all investments made by staff have the government 250,000 guarantee and with institutions with substantial asset base thank you thank you okay councillors I 've got a recommendation there that council adopt option to investment policy two to one one do I have someone to move that place have someone to move that counselors counselor capable and counselor McCallum counsel Killam Thank You Council Kapaun thank you madam mayor thank you madam mayor and I have read both of these some well read the recommendation and I 've read both of the number-one policy in the number two policy I will doubt I 'm happy to be guided by the recommendation that council adopt option two and I know that there 'll be a fair bit of discussion about it and I 'll fire the discussion closely Thank You counselor copal counselor Killam thank you I two months ago I 'm sorry counselor you 're breaking up I have a couple of concerns I 'm sorry many men will come closer to microphones if that helps I have concerns that both options limits to varying degrees diversification of investments which in any investment climate is important by there are very few if any triple-a rated investment opportunities in Australia all four major banks are AAA at the moment so there is limited slim its to how much we can where we can invest I agree we need to invest locally and we do that through the family first building society and although it 's on a noble and Building Society is in the center west [Music] [Music] you 're not option twos provides a slow mr. risk I 'm sorry counselor we that was very fragmented we didn 't really get the gist of what you were saying I 'm not sure why that is okay man I mean what I want to do is leave the meeting and rejoin it using my iPad because I 'm getting a serious delay on video as well okay Man thank you mad about I don 't like music sorry following previous meeting or the April meeting I was asked to do a the reasons behind the resolution that was made at that meeting and I did an extensive report with analysis of some of the institutions as well as why we should be investing with the five banks that has been circulated to all councillors and went to the auditors and the auditors have obviously commented I have asked of the Director of Corporate Services Corporate Services Director to provide for mr. Boucher one of the auditors the independent member to provide some comments on that I 've also asked the analysis of all of the BBB plus or less rated institutions in which we invent tests I haven 't received response to either of those I did actually look at some of the institutions we looked at and I didn 't think they actually work and substantive enough to invest in and I could find little information on a number of them and they were on pages 2 3 4 of the document that I was requested 1 and I 'd be proposing an amendment to the recommendation to state that I think my document speaks highly it shows that the major banks have been through an amazing amount of stress test since the global financial crisis and and that those banks yes they have 75 percent of the banking assets of of Australians with them now I I understand they 're obviously we need to support our local Institute but we are in difficult times and we really don 't know what the outflow of this co vat19 situation is we are sitting here and Australia is probably looking better than anywhere else at the moment but really we don 't know what businesses are going to to fail I mean I 've noticed a number of cafes restaurants chocolate shops have just shut up shops in scope of my name and I think we won 't road the real impact until we hit September to December this year and Internet into the new year if council decides to adopt option 2 so be it I say our Paulo investment policy is preservation of capital a I 've put the reasoning for that in the lengthy document that I 've done it has been as I understand it supported by both the CTA a Ric chair near Lobby and Philip budget yet a Ric independent member as I said I 've asked for clarifications through the director of corporate services from some of mr. budgets comments I haven 't received those I also asked when I provided this lengthy details as to what analysis councils had done at all of these institutions again I have received nothing I assume nothing was looked into independently by Council into these institutions that are rated triple B plus less or have no ratings therefore my position is we should be adopting option one so are you raising an amendment counselor to that effect and I am madam mayor I 'm raising an amendment that the recommendation should be that council adopt option 1 investment policy 2 1 1 we have a second counselors comes from kick me thank you you wish to speak to this council McKechnie councillor McKibben has just spoken to it yes madam mayor if I we discuss this in detail and my position then was that we should be very conservative in you know investment policy and do our best to preserve our capital councillor McKibben 's further analysis and the comments in the report from the two auditors the independent order and the council audit fact those findings of councillor McKibben 's report and I think based on that we should support the recommendation and vote for the amendment I 'll be voting for the amendment Thank You councillor there any other comment on the amendment councillors councillor donee just first up pointed information I 'm looking at my business papers here on page 21 I have one in a rank of figures with adjustments in red and then on page 28 I have virtually as the same copy of the same report with different figures on one councillor and one it 's option 2 that 's what I was assuming okay um thank you but there was no titles or something to clarify that for I supported councilor McKibben 's original impetus a very conservative or conservative management I thought that was sensible respondents that there is some sense of a community social obligation to support local businesses and that financial institutions are going to be downgraded that in fact we are not you know we are going to be struggling to find if at all triple-a rated institutions to invest in now if we go with option 2 for for example that leaves us exposed really and if I can get this clarified for the 1 million dollars everything else would be subject to the Australian Government guarantee or would be very least of those the Unrated still be subject to the Australian Government 250 thousand dollar guarantee can I get an answer on that if any of those investments are not particularly all of the best investments are protected by the government guarantee and I will just add that when you are looking at the government guarantee of 250,000 that 's per institution not per investment so if you have three investments with say a MP and it went belly-up you would get two hundred and fifty thousand you wouldn 't get two hundred and fifty thousand on each of your there that are unrighteous they are definitely still covered by the guarantee so if you had in that 1,000,000 category if you had for investments and local institutions to the value of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars they would still be protected by that guarantee as long as they will they all protect you but if you 've got it in four different institutions the whole million is protected if you 've got it in one you only get 250 thousand days and is all that 's protected and I 'll go to the director to ensure that that 's correct thank you I do I do support this conservative approach but I do have sympathy with supporting local institutions in the sense that that can you know really cascade local problems so I have a little bit of a tendency to then let this more thing option I 'd like to hear a little bit more discussion about it Thank You councillor Callum made a mirror switch devices so hopefully the audio is someone better yeah the difference between option one and option two is varying degrees and ability to diversify our investments because they are very there in back there are no major financial institutions in Australia they 're currently rated triple-a so we have been a very small pond to work in the major banks are all AAA at the moment the difference in the two policies in terms of conservatism is simply the Unrated versions and the Eric made that comment and made no other comments which tended to push my view towards option 2 it is still substantially the same risk profile except for the very bottom of the table and I think that that is considering the size of the investment and the ability to diversify that 's probably not a terrible risk to have Thank You councillor any other comments councillors on the amendment councillor Tony game thank me yes I can tell them that some why I addressed that bottom line in particular well I think we need a further amendment but you know you are we satisfied that staff would be directed to spread any investments in local financial institutions such that they would all be covered the total value general manager or through the general manager who the dry cloth maybe we try always to spread our investments especially with the local institutions we normally only have two investments at any one time would be maximum of three that we would have but it 's normally we try and have two in a local institution which would be a maximum at the current time is a maximum of the million dollars so darling madam Melanie can I get clarification on that is that 2 to 3 in 2 to 3 different institutions or are there not enough sound institutions for us to make that choice do we have all those in one institution or in three institutions we normally do you have them in two institutions at the current time we do have them both in one institution but that is because one one of the others matured and there was a better interest rate we the family first credit union but normally we do try and do two institutions thank you very much thank you else was McEwan thinking about a man I 'm first of all what believe I received a response from the order to pers yet even though I was advised now has also advised that the analysis of council of these institutions that are rated less in trouble be plate plus would be provided I don 't think I received that email today but I may have missed it that 's my first point second point is would like a response to that the second point is I did have a look at some of these institutions I 'm not as optimistic as some of the other people might be on for instance the Australian unity bank being key banking group GNC Mutual Bank Vic which was previously police association credit cooperative none of these I can find very much information on so although it may be limiting their exposure to these to 500 thousands it put still puts 250 thousand dollars with those institutions at risk and they haven 't heard the stress tests or the degree of rigor the major five banks have had over the past six years and I can see that certain of the other institutions such as the but I 'm certainly not convinced that some of the others particular is in particular because a lot of them their loans are not diversified in themselves they are to a particular client face they have been credit unions or they 've been industry of trading associations or industry associations so you know they haven 't got the diversity of exposure that the large major banks have I mean the major banks of this company have been through huge stress tests huge insight the Royal Banking the Royal Commission into the banks etc the government is not going to let any of them fail and that is acknowledged by I think mr. Burdett so although we all would like to support community organisations I 'm just not satisfied in the current circumstances and as I said we don 't know where we 're going to be in September December or early next year but these are actually financially secured you know I know that you don 't think it was developed to support us at me we do not know how many it mazey going to go to the wall saying we should try to support these people but if they 're number one hang and I think it is because we 've been caught before his present reservation of capital we have to look at the conservative Avenue thank you madam an Thank You counselors I 'm all I am speaking against the amendment I am favoring option 2 the reasons that both both of these options are so similar apart from the Unrated the 1 million in unrated but I do know that we are I do note the comments that we should be supporting our regional institutions I don 't regard judo banks and others mentioned by counsel McKibben as regional or local organizations I think that covers our credit unions and our local banks I think to put all of our eggs in one basket considering we only will get should the banks fail 250,000 per Bank not per investment and we 're putting slightly at risk our capital ratings as you will note from mr. Burgess and ster moppy are only a guide they 're not they 're not there 's no guarantees with ratings would you like or councilman would you like a right of reply I know and I have quite prepared to a man either option one or two I know the directors comments when this originally came up in April about the 250,000 limit and needing 500,000 to invest but I also note and I did seek clarification on the CTA independent member mr. Petts comments at the top of page 16 it is a suggestion by him that we should be limiting as I understand unrated institutions up to 250 thousand and no more as long as they 've got an ATI that 's the span government guarantee so whichever option what up I would be stating if they 're unrated that the limit be 200 unrated but and they have an ATI it should be limit off to 50,000 and that is I think what is being suggested so I have sort of clarification on this but I haven 't_''_3077.19 received it back and I again I haven 't had a response from the director on a there are the questions I ask please and I think that he 's what we should be doing and I 'd concur with that if if we go that either option 1 or option 2 Thank You counselor counselor Callum you 're not muted yet counselor quell unmuted can we unmute counselor Callum thank you madam mayor I agree with that particular moment the fact that we may not get us would an interest rate with 250,000 is not a problem there is a that is consistent with the the basic principle of preservation of capital and also provides an avenue for very safe diversification so I 'm perfectly happy with what councillor McInnis has proposed there that 's not what I have in the amendment what I have in the amendment is that council adopt option 1 and I haven 't got it in front of me so I can 't read what the amendment actually is could option please can I have that option or not no okay so that America the simple amendment that we 're dealing with here is that council adopt option one of the as the investments policy rather than option two so if I know the wording is that council adopt option one of investment policy two to one am I correct okay so the most the amendment is that council adopt option one investment policy two to one all in favor sorry I can 't see the screen one two three three against one two three four four I can 't see the fifth I 'm sorry house with Donnie counselor Kellum counselor saturates counselor k pool counselor McCarthy sir and I still can 't see it sorry Kelso Donnie Kelso Kellerman counselor hey Paul counselor McCarthy five thank you so the amendment is defeated we go back to the original motion that council adopt option to investment policy two to one the proposal of that recommendation was council at a pool council table do you wish to speak further on this counselor Kellum do you wish to speak further on this as a seconder yes ma 'am mayor I 'd like to propose an amendment and that is that we adopt option two but we limit these unrated investments to 250,000 per institution limit the investments 250,000 per institution where institution you 'll Cuban like to speak to that amendment counselor ma 'am eros we discussed just a few minutes ago that limits our risk and provides another level of diversity which was which was not apparent in option 1 but does so with a government-backed guarantee of 250,000 it does limit our our ability to command at the best interest rate but that is not important in terms of the basic tenets of preservation of capital Thank You counsel counsel McKinnon Thank You Madame mayor I obviously agree with the amendment because I spoke to previously I just asked as I said I am still concerned about some of the scope of the investments can I please have a response from the Director of Corporate Services to what analysis of these institutions we 've done I 've asked the question three times I have no response Thank You councillor to the director and response from and from the auditor budget but the first thing is I was told there was an analysis done of these institutions I haven 't_''_3405.93 received it I 've asked twice thank you sir the general manager to comments he has provided comments which are included in the report and is not prepared to provide any other advice or comments what he has in the report is his respira full response the second question you are asking me is you have asked for an analysis of the institution 's it was my understanding that that was put together unfortunately we have had some sick leave with staff and I know that it 's no excuse but I will have that to you today there has been an analysis done on each of the institution 's and I have quite a long list I 've just want to verify it all before I send it I don 't want to send you half an analysis thank you to the director councillor McKechnie yes Matt Mira I just on the amendment the wording the proposed by councillor Kellum should we include the only the Unrated institutions that have a guarantee a government guarantee in that wording happy with that amendment so the wording of the amendment will now be councillor the council adopt option 2 to limit the investment to unrated institutions happy with that with with a with an australian government guarantee they can be unrated and still have a guarantee she 'll have the adi it 's an it 's an authorized deposit instance that they are and authorized deposit institution is the wording okay legislation is there other comment councillors before I call up the amendment to the screen Caledonia as clarifying madam mayor the option to also states that investments should be for amount no greater than 500 thousand dollars a week retaining that phrase option 2 on page 28 of the business papers describing option 2 well if we dropped option 2 that that 's an option 2 will be what we adopt is that or am i misunderstanding you counselor well we 've we 've we 've adjusted the second part of the of the material in red unrated institutions that are authorized ad eyes we 're limiting our investments 250,000 end of each one but does that mean we are still holding the first phrase that means in all other institutions is our maximum investment five hundred thousand I don 't believe that I 'll go to the through the general manager to the director I I understand you wanting to restrict the investments in a DI unrated to 250 thousand and that 's fine I would I would recommend against changing reducing the amount of the triple a down to be triple B to any lower than five hundred thousand okay thank you madam me I just like clarified so we know what we 're voting on Thank You counselor so who we with now my pick because word Oney counselor Cuban thank you madam an um I just wonder as I said I went my analysis of these in some of these institutions was I look good me satisfied investing in some of them in the current climb but we 're limiting ourselves now to 500,000 for each you say before major banks and Bank of Queensland and I MP know that their investment of per institution I don 't know how to read it could be read per institution I think it 's to jet I 'm because it doesn 't matter I mean it seems to be it 's so my concern is that it actually may be we 've got 17 million dollars we 're going to have difficulties with the limits we 've placed on maximums and with trying to put the majority in at least relatively safe institutions with a five hundred thousand limit it 's part of my problem that we why we increased at the line at the April meeting the the limits so first a for instance we wanted to put and we 've got 17 million 2 million dollars with the nav we can 't do it I don 't believe so every wanted to put 1 million dollars with Westpac I don 't believe we can do it if we adopt this one I think the 500,000 was sort of related to because the Director of Corporate Services and originally we need at least 500,000 to invest an institution to get a reasonable interest rate now I can understand you know that concept ah I believe with our safer institutions that we should we shouldn 't be limiting ourselves to 500,000 and I think that the maximum limits should maybe increase come out that we look at it and it may very well be that it considered that some of these institutions are really not acceptable I think we will find that that we have been investing in so I 'm not sure how we 're going to make that even though they 're rated you know how we 're going to make that determination so I 've got two problems the first is I don 't think we 've got a high enough limit but we were actually investing in our safer institutions number two is we don 't know what this analysis is going to come out with and as I said I 've done some analysis and so I think we 're going to find it difficult to get some financial information out of these about these some of these bodies and if we can 't get the financial financial information that satisfactory what do we do because I assume we haven 't really done this analysis previously when we did invest in these institutions I don 't know so I think we 've got a few problems is not coping with is there any other comment before I bring this up on the screen councillor Killam not unmuted yet councillor Killam Thank You councillor Caleb I think there 's some merit what councillor give me a sign but the same problem applies to option one as well there are no double-a triple-a or double-a plus institutions on the list that we currently have though so the six million that 's allocated to triple-a institutions and five million was allocated to double-a institutions not someone it doesn 't work there the yeah a triple B plus is fine and but that 's really where most of the institutions where operating with at the moment do their business so really what the maximum limit is per investment rather than per institution and that that would make it workable okay can we have this can we have this amendment up on the screen counselors to see what we 're actually arguing here or not arguing have what we 're discussing here Sharon could I have the amendment up on the screen please I 'll come back to you counsel McKibben one and that the policy be amended to state that investments in adi unrated institutions should be with an australian government guarantee guarantee and limit and limited to 250,000 per investment now counselor this is your amendment we can 't hear you counselor counselor can we unmute counselor Calum because we can 't hear please there we go counselor I 'm sorry to ask you to start going that 's okay I suggest we sense that amendment and that is for other than the young right institutions the maximum limit is for per investment not per institution get that charge all work I 'll come back to you counsel McKibben can you put that up on the screen please Sharon when you ready because I tell him to look at Council adopt option to investment policy two to one and that the policy be amended to state that investments in adi unrated institutions should be with an australian government guarantee and are limited to 250,000 per investment other than the Unrated institutions a maximum amount is max a amount is per investment not per institution is that your amendment councillor per investment and barista traded his institution and yeah now leave that last last sentence in Shera I think that 's where after have you can you all read that councilors Castle McKibben I think the wording is a bit convoluted at the moment in that we 're talking about ATI which is the gas Australian government guarantee so I haven 't got the wording up but can i before we get to the changing the wording to actually make it make sense I just want to put a scenario up why if we 're investing in Westpac which let 's say is as a rating higher than triple B plus if we live it limit it under the maximum m22 million why should we then have to make four hundred for investments of five hundred thousand each which we 'll probably earn us a lower interest rate than if we were put two million in one investment we note we have no better guarantee because it 's a two hundred and fifty thousand of her institution so whether we make four investments of five hundred thousand or one of to minion we have no better guarantee because it 's only 250,000 per guarantee it took their institution so whenever you 're not helping ourselves here similarly you know I 'm wondering whether we should increase the DB plus maximum amount so if we were to invest two million in West Park two million in NAB two million ions at two million CBN 's two million in Macquarie we get ten million so seven million dollars of our money is being invested in institutions of triple B plus or less are we as a council happy about that I I would be happy if I knew it was say going to Bank of Queensland iamp Bank I 'm not sure that I 'd be particularly happy if we were investing 1.5 million with saying let me see I think that some point in time here we have to have some faith in our staff Mehta me if I could please Andrew the reason that we normally do five hundred maximum five hundred thousand investments okay very occasionally we do to a million dollar ones but we do this for cash money isn 't there for you know an extended time is there for operational cash flow purposes it needs to come in and out on a regular basis so that is why we do the five hundred thousand so earned on a short term rather than you know five years or 12 months 18 months without warmed up before a cash flow purpose councilors I 'm going to now put this recommendation I think we 've given this a fairly good go with I think we need went up on the screen we need to vote on this amendment please know the wording is not correct that 's why I 'm bringing it on the screen counselor okay so we 've got what we 've got written here for the amendment is the council adopt option to investment policy two to one and that the policy be amended to state that investments in adi unrated institutions should be with an australian government guarantee and limited to 250,000 per investment and per institution further it is noted that than the Unrated institution the maximum amount is per investment not per institution that you 're putting are you happy with this wording or would you like it to change to reflect discussion since it came up counsel Caliban a little bit I 'll remove now investments in ATI unrated institutions should be limited to 250,000 because with an Australian government currency is already inclusive of the term ati per institution after 250,000 just leave the final words in their institution yep you happy with that counselor I 'm happy with that madam mayor as the second okosan to get money you happy that I 'm happy with that Thank You councillor madam mayor I still I 'm still concerned I have to say about the 7 million that could be invested in less than triple B plus and the scope but anyway thank you yes I 'm heavy thank you I 'm going now to put that recommendation councillors all in favor McCarthy against councillor McCarthy in council McKechnie sorry I didn 't see your hand against I have canceled McKechnie unmuted place yeah I voted for it thank you so the the amendment is now carried councillors and the amendment now you to bring that back up again so I get it exact there with this council is it 's a bit difficult with this when you 're doing this on screen so the motion is now that council adopt option to investment policy two to one the policy be amended to state no that 's not it that 's not a challenge that you 've got highlighted the cop that council adopt option to investment policy two-to-one and that the policy be amended to states that investments in a DI unrated institution shall be limited to two hundred fifty thousand dollars per institution further it be noted that other than the Unrated institutions the maximum amount is per investment and not per institution that now becomes the motion all in favor councillors sorry I can 't see the screen against councillors the motions carried Thank You counselors sorry I can 't hear you counselor sorry I can 't hear can I have counselor McCallum because become madam a I need to go on for brief time for like to rectify tenure okay thank you okay counselors we 're on page planning and reporting we 've lost Sharon as well madam mayor if I could director to just do a clarification in relation to one of the dot points within recommendation one I lost Lynette to provide that Thank You Mimi I would like to clarify a patient in need for recommendation to F G H and I regarding the town improvements levy to add to the end of each of those points that so for example the F will read that at an improvement levy of 0.0 is there in six one five five zero nine nine cents on all rated will and categorized business in a certain quarters for section five one-eighth of the act in accordance with section five two ninety-two the of the act within the over on Township zone within the Oberon Township zone brings it is in the report but that clarifies it in the recommendation thank you okay counselors we 've got a recommendation there in eleven parts is there a move our that will route that will remove all eleven parts I 'm happy to read out the whole eleven parts if required out the whole eleven parts kawasaki burn ok the recommendation is that council adopts draft mm 2020 I 'm at amount I I would like each one the recommendations voted was voted on separately I don 't need you to read them all out okay then you need to move an alternate recommendation counselor Madame era would suggest at each of the recommendations be treated to separate recommendations and voted on accordingly one to eleven zero second to councilors council McCarthy thank you anyone not in favor of that council anyone wants to speak against that then I 'm going to put that recommendation all in favor Kerry thank you the recommendation is I will go through them one at a time part one that council adopts the drafter 2020 21 operational plan and long-term financial plan at attachment 1 and resolves to publicly exhibit the plan for 28 days in accordance with the Local Government Act 1993 submissions received during the public exhibition period will be considered and presented to the July ordinary council meeting prior to final adoption adoption can I have someone to move that please councillors a second to councillors council McCarthy thank you I wish to speak to number one and councillor Cape Horn and we unmute council okay Thank You counsel I think you 've made a man very straightforward we put the we adopt the operational plan and we put it on public display and then when if there 's any further submissions we move them in July straightforward easy Thank You council McCarthy okay will you agree with counsel tape or just any other comments on recommendation one councillors councillor McKibben um thank you madam mayor I would be proposing an amendment the amendment would be to adopt the draft operation plan and long-term financial plan attachment one with the following substantive changes a that council not increase rates by the rate dig for 2020 21 that councillors not accept an increase in remuneration for 2020 21 3 that the general manager be directed to find cost savings equivalent to 1 point 3 3 percent of expenditure across the council in areas excluding roads that is my proposed amendment mmmm do I have a seconder for that amendment councillors council McKibben Castle on a team in place thank you madam an and I think a lot of our ratepayers I really are having great problems and uh and the rates have significantly increased with obviously the SRV which for the compounding effect I stick to my position despite for comment on page top of page 40 compounding it 's been a 39 percent increase without the current value our generals increases which has substantially affected a lot of ratepayers within this council area I think council has to be serious in trying to reduce the pain I 'm suggesting that we do not increase the rates by the rate team I understand that as a council as we are probably on the lower end of the scale for payment but I think if we 're going to do this we have to show an example and that is not ask for an increase ourselves I also think that there are cost savings that can be made and I have confirmed by that by the Director of Corporate Services that 166,000 which we are looking at as the deficit if this if we our expenditure per year so we 're not looking at a 10% reduction in expenditure we 're looking at a 1.3 3% reduction and it may be slightly more if we exclude roads I understand that but I do think you know we have to make an example and have to do something for our long-suffering ratepayers and that is my proposal matter man I are proposing it as a base for McKechnie yes for the mayor we don 't know at this stage the full impact of old Cove at 19 on on the economy on on our economy as a council and on on our ratepayers but what we 've seen in some businesses in the last couple of weeks since the restrictions of Benny 's is it is very slow to come back to a sustainable revenue for some businesses there they are hurting and the small businesses as we spoke about in an earlier item are the ones that are going to be most effective and the our economy you know Ron has made up largely of small business enterprise and their employees you know we in our like recent history so I think you know anything that we can do to even provide a glimmer of hope and some relief for our ratepayers especially in the next six to 18 months we should make every endeavor to do there there are people that won 't go back to a job there are people that will go back to earning less than what they were in their businesses little close down we don 't know the full effect and we probably won 't see it laughter Christmas but I think we 're heading into very uncertain times and it could be very difficult times for a lot of our ratepayers so I think we should make every endeavor to reduce some costs and pass on a rate cut or or at least not increase the rates and I urge everybody to vote for this amendment Thank You councillor sounds for cable madam mayor madam mayor I 'd like a ruling from you please the last motion that we voted on was to was to deal with these 11 items once one at a time yeah we talking about the rapids the first one is adopting that the operational plan and the long time term financial plan but we 're talking we 're talking about the rates so if we 've decided to go and debate these issues one at a time let 's do it one at a time otherwise what are we doing I understand where you 're coming from counselor I had to him from Council and McKibben 's amendment the long-term and operational plan and long-term financial plan do actually mention of the rates so I think it could have come in either in either one or two America I 'm sorry well if that is that facts for the case madam me if that 's the case that we 're talking about the rates now I would like to speak against the amendment but I 'll wait until my right of reply and I guess rule on this is the amendment isn 't it counselor counselor McKibben witness thank you mini-me I don 't think we can I can 't we can 't_''_5405.61 adopt the operational plan a long-term financial plan as now and said we adopt it subject to the following amendments I realize it impacts on to and and following to some degree but if I don 't raise it here if we adopt the operational plan and long-term financial plan as is which I 'm suggesting we need some changes so I can 't don 't raise it now and we get to everyone will say what you 've adopted the operational plan long term plan how can you do it now I can see that is a logical argument happy for you to speak now counselor people it is the amendment you can 't speak to the amendment and the amendment is that we do not increase our rates and we do not increase payments to counselors yeah all together is that right there are three there were three items there a B and C that counselor McKibben has mentioned do you want to see the amendment up on the screen yes please yes please so there 's the amendment counselor but council adopts draft sorry that the council adopts dr 2020 21 operational plan a long-term financial counseled not increase rates by the right peg for 2020 21 which is 2.6 percent the house has not accept an increase in renumeration for the 2020 21 financial year and that the general manager be directed to find cost savings equivalent to 1.3 3% in expenditure in areas across the council excluding roads and resolves to public exhibit the plan for 28 days in accordance with the Local Government Act 1993 submissions received during the public exhibition period will be considered and presented to the July ordinary council meeting prior to final adoption adoption so that is the amendment counselor people thank you it can must be can I speak against yeah yep thank you I know that there are people in the community a number of people in the community who are hurting mainly due to the effects of fires earlier on and the the cove at 19 however we as a council we I have brought in a policy that we are assisting ratepayers who are having trouble paying paying their rates we we have a no interest on overdue rates for for the next six months this and while I only have a small holding to purse 2.6 percent increase in rates will mean fifty four dollars to us if and that 's a pretty easy calculation if somebody pays ten thousand dollars in rates and I don 't know have any I don 't know what the biggest rate payers in this area paid but there wouldn 't be many paying 10,000 a year rates that 'll mean an extra two hundred and sixty dollars I think that we would be making a mistake not to increase the rates we still are expected to maintain services provided all of the things that people that expect and I think I just think it would be a major mistake when it comes to counselors fees I 'm not too worried about that again we as we said last year we have to think of the ramifications into the future of doing that and and the the fees that are paid to counselors they 're really in the budget in the sense of the budgets neither here nor there what we 're doing I guess is some making next to you counselor we have any further comments on this one come this is a very important decision that we 're making here this evening counselors and allows you to think about it and give your views tell Sidonie thank you madam there I agree with that sentiment I do I do think we need to be a bit careful if we were not to increase rates forgive me let me take one step back I 'm for myself I 'm happy to waive the counselor increase though I 'm not sure how sensible that is the long term decision secondly if we do not increase the rates and leave them as they are and direct counsel to make the 1.33 percent cost saving they will also need to make an additional cost saving our profit approximately about 1.7 of their wages due because their wages are going to increase by 2.5 to 3 percent and I 'm not sure and I 'm not sure what the number is but I don 't if we give counsel no more revenue then they are potentially going to either lose staff expenditure to that 1.3 percent which is the CPI plus the 1.7 equivalent wages and that 's you know 1.7 in about five or six million um so you know that concerns me my my suggestion might be that we look to choose a lower level of rate increase just to sustain matters as they are not the full two point six that could be 1.5 or something of that effect I 'm just putting that out there for consideration so that council is not actually withdrawing employment and expenditure from the community I thought I don 't think council should do that at the moment so I put it in the discussion that forcing 1.3 percent of savings and no rate increase I don 't_''_5854.51 I think equally is not good for the community Thank you Thank You counselors House well house for Killam and we unmute cows with Helen please just occurred right a men merrily I agree substantially was councillor Danny and just so that everyone is aware that any increased this stage state governments us to recover that at a later stage is possible or not to 0 is a compounding and it will compound forever is more than the two percent or two point six percent loss of rates in one year it is two point six percent loss of great great revenue over the next however which used to an impact over the next decade the gain line neither here nor there about counselors increase but the staff increase which has just been negotiated which is two and a half percent and has yet to be ratified by government although and that some that will be a point of contention that 's going to take a fair chunk of our rate increase and at one point three three percent reduction in Mexico is going to hurt I don 't think that I 'm happy to have that those particular changes works through so that we can see what the effect is that we 'll be making if we do that tonight we 'll be making that decision without the information in front of us it is at the moment it is just a series of figures which seem like a good idea but we councillor Kelso Gibbons they throw the chair by the way or 1.3 increases down the middle I think it 's I certainly support something like that because I now realize people are hurting in certain areas particularly in the town area but not sure about jobs and I some of the farming community is doing well but we 've hit them hard over the last year years I just think there 's a little bit of compassion we could show and I believe that we 'd be doing that if we went 1.3 percent as far as council increases go I think the figures say we haven 't had an increase in three years in a row and doesn 't worry me either way but I think future councillors we don 't leave them too far behind because for a simple reason it 's not the easiest job in the world and there 's a big commitment when you become a council and it seems to be getting bigger and bigger every three years so I think it 's time we had a review narration there and yeah and I can look at ways cost-cutting Itoh to make up the difference so I think it 's time to review the whole thing and go with a smaller rate increase Thank You councillor council McCarthy oh I agree with that no increase and and no increase and and moon aeration it 's green at the moment but we forget for three to four years we 've been carting hay in that haze but we paid for it 's probably taken long-term loans some of us donated very little they really I think our communities out there hurting and and this is a rumor I hope that just shows that we care I know that the it 's going to be impact but I think without the increase we can still get through it 's like the consultant we had he 's told us we go to their maintenance on the roads we 've been bringing that up at works meetings and general meetings for ages it 's not until we get a consultant in ER to consider amount of money that we take any notice so I support no increase in counselors could I ask as this is such an important decision that we 're going to make it 's nice that I can get a comment from the general manager either the general manager or the director on the ramifications of what we 're considering here thank you thank you very much ultimately what we 're proposing here is to put a operational plan on exhibition matter man we 're not making the decision on whether council should go down this path or not whilst I acknowledge everything that everyone said in the room we 're looking to get a document on exhibition to allow for the public counselors and the like to make comment as to what they believe to be the best way forward for our council I 'm prepared and I 'm happy throughout for our staff to bring back a report in July outlining what the ramifications of decreasing the number of things that that has been outlined in in this in the in the spread of options that counselors have put out but ultimately what we want to do is also hear from the from and I think that that 's probably something that we could defer with further further information brought back to councillors prior to adoption I 'll further note in the report a number of options have been considered as part of not taking a rate increase minimizing the rate increase and there 's considerable amount of information there the talked about why the staff have indicated their their preferred recommendation and the draft operational plan as it sits so I just want to make councillors aware of that as because I am sure there will be a number of of submissions launched by our community outlining different things that council will consider prior to the adoption of the 2021 operation thank you it 's a director wish to add anything to that the general manager we this recommendation is to adopt the draft resolution the operational plan and long-term financial plan to put it on exhibition for 28 days so that we can further work on it in accordance with suggestions that might be raised by either councillors thank you from my perspective I 'm I 'm still to be convinced good idea I 'm open I am open to a lower reduction possibly at 1.5 percent maybe I 'm yet to be fully convinced about it I 'm quite happy with the no increase in the council council of enumeration and I 'd like a little bit more information around the general manager identifying the savings in the third part of that amendment so as as we are putting this out for exhibition and there is time then counselors to be more in or better informed about the repercussions of it issues decision they 're going to make when the plan comes back I would be speaking against this amendment this particular amendment I 'm more than happy for the operational plan to go on public exhibition and to have the discussion on the rate issue when it comes back to Council so council McKibben would you like to write a reply there thank you madam a and I think the issue here is that we are putting a fundamental policy and financial plan on public exhibition and the right players believe that the document they 're seeing is going for the future if we 're intending to reduce the rate increase and to make savings and to have no I think we should at least we can 't_''_6430.929 put a plan out that has basically has all its premise on the basis there 's going to be a 2.6 percent rate increase there 's going to be council remuneration increase and that expenses are going to basically be asked for shadow because we if we then resolve later not to then the community might say well why didn 't you tell us that you were going to look at that in the operational plan and financial plan at the very least we have to have something on this plan to say that the rates expenses etc I still under review and council is considering a number of options I don 't believe we can put it out there as it is when we may be making potentially these substantive changes and that 's why I 've raised as part of as an amendment to recommendation one Thank You counsel one yes the general manager threw the chair equally madam the end of it decided to take up the full 2.6% like each of the options that have been raised here are something that that we would consider as part of that exhibition process now what I 'm suggesting is that as the report highlights there are a number of options for council to consider and I 'm more than happy during the exhibition phase to put the council are looking at a number of options those options include not taking up the rate increase minimum partially taking up the rate increase looking at at levels of service and reduction levels of service because that 's what you 're asked in a savings document that you want me to do but I don 't know what they are yet so I don 't know that I can tell you that this is what we will do or this is what we won 't do because at the end of the day that will be a decision for councils to make based on a a report that we submit together with the public exhibition details from the community Thank You general from the other perspective you can I ask for some cop on what effect this increase would have on on the pensioners of town before it really bought any wag jumps in and thinks this is a self-interested sectional question that 's not but I 'm just thinking you know often we look at a number of groups but we we forget now let 's outspoken I 'm just wondering is what I 'm not sure what the adjustments in the pension are and I 'm not sure what the adjustments in the local government and state government rebate that we that we make up so I 'm just asking what would be the impact of that 2.6 percent on that group from other director or general manager possible through the general manager I 'll defer to the common services director thank you through me it was very difficult to say without having a look at where the counselors leave the where they live will depend on power how much their rates increase it would depend on the values I could not answer that at this point of time we and we still do have the pensioner rebate so if there is something that Council and the state government are continuing madam mayor I may have made that a bit difficult um what is the adjustment process for pensions on an annual basis can someone remind me the increase in the pending in the pension yes it 's CPI I think is no I 'm really not sure either I 'm sorry highlights to me that we need further information around the repercussions of what we considering here which would put it at about 1.3 percent if that 's there for a pensioner you know is immediately going to be two point one point two percent what 's off Thank You counselor okay counselors is there any further comment on this one but I 'm going to have to put the the amendment sorry I can 't hear busy counselor Kellerman where is counselor kill him that 's a very good question I can hear him building that 's what Kalamazoo me at ten days maybe okay stop have you been following that debate counselor Killam there is actually a is that the how hustle starve analyze the posed challenges and bring that back to Council in July for wrote for for consideration okay thank you okay Castle Capel that 's okay can we unmute counselor cable sorry counselor cable that 's alright I think I 'm I think I 'm away yeah I 'd be I would be happy to accept in my motion the we 're talking about the amendment ugly we 're talking about the amendments first of all counselor yeah right oh so it 's not ugly okay okay counselors if there 's nothing else on counselor Oh general manager or you might have man just by way of clarification the current amendment says something different than what that what we 're proposing now if you 're gonna include counselor columns addition that staff do a do an analysis because and and I can 't say the amendment in front of me but what I 've written down is that that we adopt the draft 21 long-term and operational plans for exhibition with the following changes and those following changes are there are no right peg the GM find savings of 1.3 3% excluding roads now if the amendment is supported in that nature it 's not an analysis or area that is the amendment that is the outcome that is the outcome of this I agree okay counselors where the invent the amendment is there that and we need now to vote on it Sharon could I get the amendment actually brought up so everybody is absolutely clear on what they 're voting on at this point in time so the amendment is that council adopts the drafter 2020 21 operational plan and long-term financial plan at attachment 1 with the following substantive changes that council not increase rates by the rate peak for 2020 21 that council does not accept an increase in renew maury ssin for the 2021 financial year that the general manager be directed to find cost savings equivalent to 1.3 3% in expenditure in areas across the council excluding roads and resolves to probably publicly exhibit the plan for 28 days in accordance with the local government action 1993 and the submissions received during the public exhibition period will be to final adoption now that is the amendment councillors that you 're voting on now and I am now going to put the amendment all in favor three all against one two three four five the amendment is lost we go back now to the original motion that council adopts the draft 2020 21 operational plan and long-term financial plan at attachment 1 and revolves and resolves to publicly exhibit the plan for 28 days in accordance with the Local Government Act 1993 submissions received during the public exhibition period will be considered and presented to the July ordinary council meeting prior to final adoption now the mover of that motion was councillor Capel councillor capable do you have anything further to add can we um you transfer cable place it just depends if there 's any further discussion madam mayor if there is further discussion I would hold off for my right of reply Elsa McCarthy do you wish to speak again to that you were the second down now you gotta have a seconder to get the discussion going thank you comments many other comments counselors or have about a recommendation that the general manager consider looking into savings that amount to a hundred and sixty six thousand let 's say whatever the figure was and provide a report hundred sixty six thousand five hundred and twenty seven which is a projected deficit of two point two point six percent right beggars not a document so I would have thought that needs to be incorporated within this recommendation be provided July meeting or I can be a separate like to see incorporated in this recommendation counselors in yes or it can be a separate recommendation counselor okay Paul it 's your it 's your motion I 'm not I 'm not sure madam mayor of the wording that Council on McKibben suggesting could you repeat it please council McKibben right of the word submissions in resolution in recommendation one the general manager shall investigate and provide a report on potential savings of a hundred and sixty six thousand five hundred and twenty seven dollars in expenditure excluding roads for the July 2020 consul meeting and then the sentence will remain submissions received during public exhibition etc that will Collin council cape or did you get that yes I did yes I did thank you madam mayor I I really think it 's a separate issue but don 't deal with that separately yeah I think it would be better Thank You councillor make it on your putting an amendment then another amendment to that motion to bring up one I 'm happy to have if it helps to have a resolution 1a that would read the same wording is that I have just suggested if that helps counts on the cable and others council Caples this has either got to be part of part one or it needs a separate recommendation or an amendment for the sake of my arm yet for the sake for the sake of expediency I 'll exhibit the addition Thank You counsel McCarthy there 's the second oh yeah you happy with that is there any comment on it before I bring this up on the screen councillors Marin could we bring up their spirit on the screen with the addition place to the port tot one so the motion now is that plan at attachment 1 and resolves to probably exhibit the plan for 28 days in accordance with the Local Government Act of 1993 the general manager shall investigate and provide a report on potential savings of one hundred and sixty six thousand five hundred and twenty-seven dollars in expenditure excluding roads for the July 2020 council meeting submissions received during the public exhibition period will be considered and presented to the July ordinary council meeting prior to final adoption I 'm putting that recommendation councillors all in favor that resolution is carried thank you we now go to part 2 the council adopts and resolves to public publicly exhibit the statement of revenue policy and attachment to including 2020 21 fees and charges and 2020 21 rating structure usually better mayor but you have been muted you can mute it and I can 't seem to unmute you I 'm sorry you need to unmute yourself can you hear me now can you hear me now counselors okay okay I read it again cut to that council adopts and resolves to publicly exhibit the statement of revenue policy at attachment structure in accordance with chapter 15 part 1 of the Local Government Act 1993 the following rates and charges are set for every parcel of ratable land within the overall local government area for the period from 1 July 20 to 30 June 21 can I have a mover place councillors Telstra Dhoni and a seconder place Oh help us 1l house look killem thank you Casa Dhoni his fees and charges are calculated on the basis of the 2.6 percent rate increase and so if I could the face of charges are actually calculated on CPI increase of 1.3 percent did you hear that counsel Dhoni counsel donees muted I did I did note that madam mayor I said the breakthrough on 2.6 percent 1.3 counselor 1.3 percent the director has just informed you know madam knew the rates are on 2.6 percent okay these the charges are a different matter okay so it 's really a formality much of this until we decide exactly how much that rate increase would be the only other thing I 'd say is that that 's the best presentation of fees and and it was the most easy one to understand I 've ever come across in council papers so that was good but unless someone can point out something else to me this is based on 2.6 percent for the rights and other issues CPI 1.3 for the fees and charges so there 's not much to talk about it but with this section Thank You Katherine Celso Callum happy with what counsel Dhoni said it 's a pretty good summation of the nature of recommendation thank you comments councillors castellon McKibben thank you met Amir I take it obviously F G H and I are amended as per the Director of Corporate Services comments earlier then we 're adopting those amendments and the second thing is we we 're adopting a statement of revenue policy to be exhibited when we haven 't actually determined that we are going to increase the rates by 2.6 percent that 's my only concern and that the and the fees and charges by 1.3 percent we 're putting it down pretty equivocal II hear that that 's what we 're accepting which we haven on public exhibition councillor for submissions and as the general manager indicated he 's happy to put an append Amanat that we are considering various options within this report within there I 'm happy on the basis that I 'm happy on the basis of the attend and on the basis the addendum is included you know manager if through the chair as part of our exhibition process we 'll make that very clear councillor one wall leading to the other this is purely for exhibition should counsel resolve to do something else then that will have a flow-on effect through these resolutions coming back for endorsement so we will make it very clear to our community that one of the the the intrinsic processes that councils want to see is the potential for not having a right peg for the 2021 year thank you to the journal manager any other comments counselor McKechnie no no any other comments counselor Gibbons madam mayor but it just was a question of fees and charges it 's in the attachments for the machinery and I was just going to ask a question talking are council not just attachment 1 page 23 excellent one thank you got the rights are early rights of the machinery and try this and lightest but then a bit further or now we discussed this once before that 's the utilities and I was just going to ask on that is the utilities running around at 72 an hour is that to be added up under the grader with operator of 192 or is it how 's all that work there thank you the general manager I 'm happy to refer to the technical services director I think 's met a met yeah the utility charge is separate to any other plan higher charge so in the case that councillor Gibbons has asked it is it is a separate charge in addition to the grading or the greater thank you is that an hourly rate or is that a daily rate I 'm pretty cheated that 's an hourly right now that puts a good yeah that puts a greater with his operator at 260 or dollars in here any hour that 's for private works RMS or how much a raise kind of cost to construct is the greater work out of that 260 with the vehicle through the cheer there 's an external rate and an internal rate to different rates but gear for a private work that would be the applicable rate and then and then my information says the half hour of the top of this or a yeah sorry not a minute yeah could I suggest there 's some of these things given else forgiveness is Joe speaking all right are you still speaking counselor Gibbons just after counseling Donnie said I believe that he 's not correct there in the half-hourly race this reality writes thank you this is this correct when I go to the director place I 'm a threaded through the chair they are hourly rates the document allows for a half-hour charge okay or the minimum charge for all planned equals half an hour that says yeah Thank You counselor McKibben sorry well mute cost you okay can I suggest about a man I think I raised it last year we put a fourth column in here saying DIY four-day the silent attendance you know because for some of these it 's clear where it talks about kilograms

the local government X is that correct so a council can issue the benches or securities and other councils invest in another council through those debentures insecurity is that right go to some advice from the director page 35 of 35 [Applause] okay counselor I hope the page now could you please repeat can issue debentures or securities and that another council can purchase them as acceptable investment strategies some of the larger councils have the ability to do that but the smaller councils it there are a few very few councilors who have the ability to do that yes okay I was surprised by that thank you Thank You counsel counsel McKibben can we unmute I take counselor Dining 's point not a mare but we have just put an investment policy in place that says there has to be an ATI in

voted against my wishes I just want to check that out thank you I 'm putting recommendation 11 that council resolved to seek comment on its current vision and mission statement during a 28-day public exhibition period all in favor Harry thank you your comments why don 't some slightly thrown because I went through these in a favorite of detail and so this is rocky going quickly through them a bit later on and I kept looking for the strategic plan to come up as a specific item and be right I can hear you post one I can hear all right well I disappeared visually so that 's alright I was looking for the delivery plan to come up as a specific item linked to the local strategic planning statement which I didn 't find so I 'm guessing that the strategic planning statement is hidden within number seven or is included within number seven as part of the community 's strategic plan is that correct it does state that in line with the objectives of the community strategic plan which is our overarching document and is the the last item in the papers which is the remaining at the local strategic planning statement is that part of the community strategic plan I 'm not sure the question where you 're going here counselor Tony well I 'm trying to find out where discussion of the local strategic planning statement is in these papers are you 69 counselor thank you thank you okay councillors we 're now moving on to page 47 item 1303 town signage final Design Concepts there 's a recommendation in three parts they 're counselors that council endorsed the natural beauty design concept in order for staff to progress the implementation of new signage across the LGA but council progressed the implementation of new signage across the LGA in accordance with the report and funding requirements that council nominate the opening ten open tendering method as described in accordance with Clause 166 bracket a of the local government regulation 2005 for the construction of the town signage project can I have a mover for the recommendation place do we have a seconder councillor Kellan thank you council McKibben I 'm thinking about a mayor obviously this has been a very thorough process and it 's good to see that we actually have a the winner in relation to concept and by quite a margin the only issue obviously that obviously would concern us all I suppose is the concept of cost and in that respect in relation to recommendation to are we going to look at one of the options referred to on pages 53 to 55 as to which should apply as a separate recommendation or are we sort of leaving that up in the ether to be decided later and my concern is that we need to be reasonably durable what we go out for our christen tender so that we get some reasonable pricing and and I am concerned that the pricing will obviously be because this is a third concept will be maybe a lot of higher than we think so I just some clarification and that in proposing the recommendations madam an Thank You general manager I think you met a 's exactly the world went with the number of options to consider as part of that tend to stand a brief I believe that if you went with the entirety of the project you would get some value adds but we need to give some certainty around what that would mean hence the reason why we 've provided the three options to say that is what we 'll ask is part of the tender requirements so yeah I the indicative cost says that given the given the preferred option we may need to look at scaling the project hence the reason why I 've asked for the story options thank you the general manager Telstra look it man oh thank you man oh man oh I must admit I just wonder whether we should be going with options one on page 53 and 54 because really I think options free is more than ample really for what we 're asking I think you know one and two or more I think that 'd be nice to have but really I think you 're going on the low of the top in our community also you know doesn 't think we 're spending too much on this I just think option three looks fair and reasonable I mean Edith and Mount David yes their localities but they 're not villages to the same degree as as the others I mean you know you can argue black Springs has four entrances but really the major ones are on the Abercrombie Road south and the Abercrombie Road East so to make you sign there and I think that 's amply put in options free I just think we 're going in I just like to make requests pretend to simple so we get good answers back rather than giving too many options which gender is used to muddy the water a bit sometimes it 's only a comment I would be happy to add a had a recommendation to confine it to option three but I 'd be interested to hear what other councillors user thank you general manager sorry about a may just threw clarification councils will remember as part of this project they approve the scope of works to prepare this a if an option come back was too too expensive then council would have a fair and realistic understanding of what the scope and what the project was about it 's purely comply option one purely complies with the with the resolution made by counsel at the time Thank You councillor Danny in discussion with some about the community group down the hill last evening they 're very pleased to see the natural beauty one come up but I note on page 55 on the next steps it says should counsel endorse the natural eunuch concept as signage design toolkit will be developed and an open tender now my concern is there 's just a little bit of fine-tuning we 'd like to do to the thrones now that we 've got the broad concept as it 's been explained so how we how are we going to look at using the signage design toolkit if we 're going straight to open tender manager put it through the chair the toolkit will inform the tender council so the development of the toolkit gives the the perspective tender is an opportunity preferred options were and the toolkit is the mechanism VI will do that and is there any further refining of the toolkit sorry Joe no manager okay sorry madam mayor through through this whole process that the options that have been endorsed by council have now been put on exhibition as those exhibition documents have been dealt with the final concept has been prepared by the by the the consultant that we 've engaged to do this he is taken into consideration as part of this report the submissions that have been lodged through the exhibition phase and this is the this is the final product that he 's proposing there is a number of smaller and unique options that I 'm sure though we can set it as part of each of each other unique solids are we put for each of the localities but we 're looking to finalize this toolkit as part of this recommendation I think smaller and unique options gives me enough room to work with so thank you Thank You councillor Telstra Killam sorry I think a particularly good process we 've been through as a result in a pretty resounding large minority of people who have signed signed up to the natural beauty content but we didn 't within that the designs that are there and the three options are really just a matter of number of different signs that we can go for I think I had certainly have no problem supporting the recommendations and supporting an open tender and that open tender will then inform council on what level of signage we can get within reason thank you gonna kick me yes ma 'am I 'll just one point that I 'm not sure if it 's just been overlooked or these just being left off good maybe Hazel Grove we haven 't forgotten Hazel Grove ever threw the chair my honesty as Hazel Grove wasn 't part of the signage well let 's start with what the toolkit will enable us to do is to prepare signage in a consistent and ongoing way these are this document is to prepare and inform the scope that we 're looking to put in place however it 's council want to include Hazel will add decide and we 'll go to tender in that with that with that additional number of signs that are proposed techniques yeah I think we definitely should include it it 's a locality the same as O 'Connell Mariga Edith and Mount David in fact could be bigger than some of those four so I think we should definitely include it part of our local government area and I just think could it be a slight on on the area being one of the older areas in the lack of government area if we don 't include it Thank You councillor Justin Gibbons up a G so the chair I 'd like to see another round answer a later date that so we can have many localities distinct on the on air tourist Rose and Hazel Grove would be just one of quite a few Weisman Street poor as the treat localities they 're all over the place where you 've got clusters of housing I don 't think this is the right time I think Hazel Grove has a few houses in the great history but there do see when you 're driving around you 're in the locality adults people somewhere else I think they should be recorded in time but not this time Thank You councillor now the comments councillors of putting the recommendation in three parts all in favor carried unanimously thank you page 69 councillors item 1304 local strategic planning statements the recommendation is that council endorsed the oberon local strategic planning statement LSPs 2014 and i have a mover place and i have a mover place councillor McKibben thank you a second up councillor Killam Thank You councillor Kieran thank you madam mayor there 's been a lot of community engaged in this process and a lot of community feedback which the director has indicated has been taken up and considered in in the strategic planning statement so I agree with the recommendation the council endorsed the broad local strategic planning statement LSPs to 2014 thank you madam mayor agree with I 'd like to have an undertaking from the general manager to review the the an update to LSPs by the end of this year there are some submissions I know carefully and I think that we need to perhaps have a further look at this noting we do have to have it in to like obviously local government by the end of this month so there 's not a chance to update it before then Thank You councillor have any comment general manager Bri the chair given the resolutions you 've made in previous reports the LSPs may need to be updated by virtue of a potential change in vision or mission statement that 's been that 's been proposed to be looked at by out by the resolution that you 've previously made in terms of the strategic planning statement it 's been substantially consulted with the community and those those comments have been taken into consideration in preparation of this report the review is required every seven years however I note given the recommendations that we 've made previously it 's going to happen a lot quicker than that but budget the strategic words and visions within that within that document and the land use sentiment that applies to that document in it in it 's as as in perpetuity in line with the in line with all the other strategies docked me until we developed Thank You counselor Dhoni some minor things and some major things just on your in the mayor 's forward I know there 's been some typos adjusted but um the term the Great Divide I would have thought that with the capital letters as in a proper noun otherwise I don 't know what the Great Divide is if it doesn 't have capital measures comes from social division that 's on page two of the office statement just to be a little pedantic cry please ask through the general manager the director of planning and development to take a look at page 17 in the business papers and in the second part of the page it says six government departments submissions and seven community submissions have been reviewed was suggested LSPs inclusions an amendment for John review resulted in a mine in minor changes being made to the LSPs the second dot point discussions removed from actions one to four as the other actions do not incorporate discussion points and questions Planning industry and environment about the statements which were being made after the action points how do you on council on page 70 of the none of the attachments of the of the business papers the second point yep I 've looked at that multiple times I cannot make any sense whatsoever of what that is son none whatsoever because like and we have some clarification please from the director through the general manager yes madam mayor all the other action points don 't have that discussion after the draft was the only one that did so and as I those four points it just soup to me if we have discussion points card to actions we should have one after all the actions and we didn 't do it so I just didn 't think those consistent you know stirred document that 's why I took those out of the four points thank you to familiarize myself but my other point is is in in the delivery plan we allocate only one point one percent of funding towards heritage in these submissions to the local strategic plan from several and cultural heritage neither the term heritage or historical context or any notion of landscape heritage appears in the strategic plan whatsoever and if you were to look at the vision statement and anything to do with tourism what we are attempting to attract people here with is natural beauty the heritage tours of equally successful up there with the forests and foraging tours but heritage and natural landscape occur nowhere in this document and I bet I find that actually to be unacceptable so I think that needs to me to be really dressed it 's even part of our delivery plan it 's part of so many of our other documents and it 's not part of our long-term strategic plan they 're not mentioned LSPs you may not the community strategic plan and the L is the LSPs that 's right okay so it 's in the submissions it 's a delivery plan it 's in our mission station statement it 's in our tourism documents and nowhere is it in this document here we get a comment on that through the general manager through direct from page 36 so don 't forgive me interrupting metameric talks about the strong agricultural economy which I thoroughly support but it doesn 't talk about the issues on Georgia let 's through the chair page 37 promote and preserve our natural environment and water okay these are the government agencies to further develop and provide opportunity for natural areas of the local government area I agree but as I said there 's no mention of heritage and there 's no mention of cultural and landscape heritage which we have one we have we have several conservation areas and these submissions you had submissions both from several areas of the local government area from both both ends of the local government area talking about in importance of landscape preservation but it is not in this document okay any further comment the general manager or the director if this is coming thank you also direction direction 16 and 17 on page 32 when I talk about they talk about the heritage assets and the Aboriginal heritage h32 planting priority to community well-being serve an adaptively reuse heritage assets I didn 't quite the submissions and in some of the governmental submissions as well I mean adaptively really use a harried suggests that 's malachi gilmore some people are coming from sent me to see malachi gilmore but most are coming to see a bit of snow and a great deal of natural beauty that 's what they come here for okay counselor thank you i knows that this will company coming back probably for review depending on previous resolutions maybe we could ask the director to have a look at that but i do not also note that this has to be in with the department by the 1st of July mm-hmm so I 'll go to the general manager to see what the what a solution may be here or true that through them through the chair whilst am I not saying exactly what counselor Dhoni is asking certainly the the provisions outlined by the director of give some I believe would give some comfort to the fact that we don 't shun away from protecting in the integrity of our heritage item this is a land use document that goes to be considered as part of that I think that things have been raised by the director of wood in its initial phase meet the requirements that have been proposed by Council of Damien 's thank you councillor doneö I think this will take a while for work this way through the system later Mara certainly appreciate any improvement in bringing heritage and environmental assets into a higher profile even the even the departmental letters and submissions at the end for both residents and departmental submissions all tend to focus on these issues of heritage heritage landscape and environmental assets and I don 't think we give them enough of the role you know Thank You councillor we 'll note those comments you know the comments on this one councilors going to put the recommendation all in favor against so caledonia is against the recommendation is carried Thank You counselors page 72 counselors reports for information item 1401 monthly actuary port general manager recommendation is that the item is received for information can I have someone to move this bass castle McEwen and counselor Gibbons Thank You Council McEwen thank comments like would I page 74 under 32 21051 nine the Oberon Sports Complex it says funding opportunities through the federal government are currently in place I thought they were currently being investigated not in place through the chair we 've launched a number of funding opportunities in this space that 's why it 's stated in that way can I suggest it slightly different and say the council is seeking through the federal government and funding through a number of avenues or something like that that couldn 't be funding opportunities I currently in place could major some people mean they 're actually being obtained anyway I understand we 're saying yeah top of page 75 when does this trial complete it is at the end of this month summer we have a report in July went through the chair yeah the report will be back I brought my to get into July on the sorry that paid 75 halfway down the road management audit could you just remind me I was actually expecting to see the report at this meeting could you please just remind me of the absolutely and went through the draft I was expecting as a set of report to be tabled to this meeting what 's the current timetable through through the chair we 're looking at a response to those recommendations as you 're aware a number of those recommendations need a detailed response which is being prepared we 'll give that to consultant for the final document to be prepared and hopefully will be done by the end of this year financially and it will well nihlus fearing committee see the response I 'm I 'm having to provide the student community response yes if we could play think that through the chair the steering committee also assisted in that process by providing a number of responses themselves so are they going to be appropriate for the steering committee to see those things now that 's why I was asking I just wanted to see where we were okay understand 77 on page 78 in relation to the recruitment recovery has advised the unable to gain conduct face to face pre-employment screenings this is the bottom of page 78 under the heading holes that change in striding this reporter was still at home noting that I think at least one of them may change as a result of the Rhodes review through the chair a number may change but we are given there frictions being eased in the Cova we were we are actively working towards business as unusual and I say that because I think anything will be the same ever again and that will be looking to implement those positions in the near future where appropriate subject to taking cognizance of what the roads review said and done and obviously Sommelier comments design absolutely thank you madam mayor thank you oh yeah I recommend the report be received as information Thank You counselor Kelsie Givens so the chair just on page 74 with bog and the sports it sounds as if we you 've had a meeting since our last meeting with Borg it says on the bottom paragraph meeting with Borg Hill to discuss moving the project forward and finalized EMA you and council to launch a da so is that the way I 've read what 's happened 'll go to the general manager and through the chair a number of other meetings have been dealt with and we 're looking to progress that it 's one of the matters that we 're looking to continually progress in order to give some clarification around what the proposal will look like I believe there 's a meeting quite soon thank you under the checklist on page 77 down the bottom you have toilets daily checklist 45 I 'm just just a big concern to some of the outlying toilets and just wondering they just have a roster that I mean there 's a lot of rent and any explanation of how a roster might work or does work together on some of the other offerings councillor 77 the council know that as part of our covert pleads that we closed a lot of our outlying toilets given the the capacity for the transmission of the virus so we took the option to close a number of them closing a number of them gave us another opportunity to in fact enhance the cleaning within the ones that we consider of that 's where we concentrated which is why those those the numbers of survives that it 's the way that we 've implemented that program and once again with the implementation and the relaxation of the coded restrictions we 're progressively opening nose back up and the clean regime will continue as norm Thank You councillor any other comments on this one councillors put the recommendation all in favor carry thank you age 83 item 1402 monthly activity report Planning and Development the report the recommendation is that the report is received as information can I have someone to move that place castle McEwan and councillor Gibbons Thank You councillor McKibben I noticed that the director has had an active active month with dog lick relations learning and page 88 and the comment and the compliance where are we with the India fitness and a lot on page 83 when in June to expect that to be finalized is that that will achieve practical completion at that stage yes where the gentleman it 's very huge to the general management director yes man made to the castle should be looking in early July July Thank You counselor I move the recommendation Thank You councillor Gibbons yeah page 84 the top square yeah bird dog off leash just big assume that coming up every meeting where we see this and we see that boy I nominated the amphitheater area to be looked at twelve eighteen months ago I just think it 's time that with the right authorities we go down and have a look at that that 's being set aside for our community years was used to store a lot of feel when they put that year we 're in the Dean to say that the spill away I think it 's a great place for it I just there 's natural Bush land there there 's a real level place it 's a big area well grasped few kangaroos around I just think it 's an opportunity for us to have a look and try and make it a season and get this off their books he 's been there too long so I 'm hoping that we can counselors and management not the other go down and be going shortly Thank You counsel I 'd I do note that this has been going on for quite some time and we do have a new director who has been busy getting documents ready and finalized and I 'm sure that he will be now looking at these this moving forward you know at the site inspection was made and counselors have come along and talk about it so I think you director with new eyes it 's a great place I 've just seen these places in with go and Bathurst and people are loading up their pups in cars and traveling six and eight kilometers to get get to life like this and not as good as this saw it but then I was 200 meters out of the town limits and it 's just a nice quiet peaceful place plenty of shade and I think we should be moving on that it comes from I can 't hear you yeah thank you thank you any other comments on this one counselors chalcedony just a question on page 83 the draft village community plans which I would was undertaken in community surveys which is part of our strategic whatever just when they go to exhibition and discussion is that have we had the opportunity to have some idea of how that will occur yet the director sort through the chair of things a bit unfair on the director dance of this question committee wasn 't here when they definite I 'm quite happy to take the UM take the lead in this case madam mayor the draft village plans have been prepared they are currently in draft and we 're reviewing them as as as they as I know Kobe do understand has certainly made it very difficult for us to engage and go through the consultation that we would like to see in that in that regard especially given we 'd like to see our village plans had some ownership over those village groups that look after our villages so well and so I want to be a matter of and given the easing of the of the coded restrictions that we 're finding pretty much by the week then we looking to going to the free consultation potentially and then an exhibition fax if if possible we 're hoping that restrictions will allow public meeting they 're making to this through the chair I 'd like to do it in accordance with our community engagement policy that says that we go in engagement and we talk to our communities the current restrictions haven 't_''_11219.62 allowed us to do that thank you very much Thank You councillor Tony any other comments on this one councillors that 's a cable thank you thank you madam mayor I too am I look concerned about the the village community plans and I know it 's been well basically impossible to to to meet to have the meetings of the villages but a plan that is based on a SWOT analysis really is is going off half-cocked a SWOT analysis is really only the start of of the event that needs to be followed up and even though as far as I 'm aware at Black Springs and I guess the other places are the same we had a very quick SWOT analysis one evening and there 's been been I say I think it 's what analysis is really only the first step that needs to be followed up because it needs to be built need to build on on how we manage the strengths what what we do about the weaknesses and threats and etc it really should be a fairly long plan alone yeah a long program to come up with a decent village plan and as you say mr. general manager the young to give ownership of these plans to the villages through the general manager agree but the thing is we need to take something to our villages to give them something to look at well that 's what we 're prepared to do fair enough okay Thank You councillor any more comments put the recommendation counselors or all Castle McCarthy you have

probably needs to be updated because the meeting was held a schedule of activities was presented that needed to be achieved to bring this plant to fruition and the further testing and certainly those activities were dependent on the further testing in June have those the testings been completed yet or are they still waiting for the end of June to confirm what our projections are in relation to organic matter it 's a veteran yeah through the chair will probably have some comprehensive results by the end of June further discussion has been had on Monday of this week with the Department of primary industry and environment in relation to progressing the vstp project which is favor really moving along in terms of getting some concurrence in that space so once those results are available we 'll certainly be looking to put together another working party to discuss the results and then how that then progressed progresses in terms of funding and alike from that stage ok page 93 two-thirds the way down the page roadside vegetation management plan just to update you and the general manager I have talked to the UM CC general manager in relation to this it doesn 't appear that we can get uniformity across all councils so um CC is going to come back over on specifically on comments on its roadside vegetation management to get that resolved thank you we can 't get all councils to agree completely on everything some have already got some in place some have got no plans in place and don 't intend to put plans the top last section there 's a tee missing GPS units now installed on all council trucks at 4.5 GPM and above on page 95 halfway down I assume that the jenolan Brigade shed won 't have any asbestos we might have issues there that require a variation through the chaired is certainly no asbestos I was a at that site this afternoon actually having a further review of the site prior to the demolition with the RFS so we 're we 're right to go there with clearing the side and leveling in in the event of preceding construction of a new shed no further comments not an era of lost sound Thank You counselor McKibben counselor Burnie age 96 mayor just looking for a comment through you and the general manager on the castle r8 highway job was there any fat in that for us and how how nearing completion what is the directors you know view of the work done through the chair yes the the work physical work or construction works out being complete in essence off council 's part barring the contractual work with the completed there will be certainly an element of it from that particular work I don 't actually know that figure but certainly can look at further asking thank you Tony any other questions on this point counsel on McCarthy any forward to that general bushfire said what where is the outcome of the site is it gonna be the existing shed footprint or where we have to decided by all the agencies yep through the chair speaking with national parks jenolan caves trust and the RFS the the outcome has been resolved we we believe on the existing footprint certainly there are a number of challenges with relation to the vehicle appliances of the cat one type tankers looking at potentially bigger doors to allow for better angle off parking those vehicles within the the new facility and you know potentially what other excavations may be heard around the site with relation to the the upper escarpment and alike which certainly we 're not of the view of going extensively into that escarpment given the steep gradients and natures there of stability and alike so the existing footprint is the was done about 20 years ago and the add-in to the training room is it that was added on to us that 's correct and given the complexities off if we were to deviate from that existing site certainly would trigger a number of issues in relation to acquiring additional land from national parks and or concurrence from jenolan caves trust so it is understood and we believe that this stays at a new facility even being being a bigger shed will be without challenges certainly be able to be located within the existing area of where the former shed was thank you mr. Gibbons the chair there 's been some pothole patching it 's on page 90 89 but on that mount david road strip of bitumen i was through there the other day just after the pothole patching has happened it 's just a fairly dangerous a little bit of ride there for about nearly a kilometer and might be worth more to have a look at it because i think the roads deteriorating not sure whether they might be better there be vehicle movement on there present I think through whether we 've got to keep a real check on that and you may have to do a bit of an upgrade there now with the shoulder widening on up on the highway so it was mainly to accommodate guardrail so they sell that area do that they sell the from the fog line out to accommodate the garden I always that the moon that happens I threw the chair here that was a scope of the work in terms of widening the shoulder as part of a safety project and it did involve certainly I mean providing additional pitchman to the the outer area of the broach holder correct just the meeting you attended 98 page 98 the four days of the fifth joint planning assessment moving but that is that about giving us the opportunity to plan for heavy patching and serving and you get the opportunity to talk about the to define places between here and Baathists the council macarthur yourself talked about with regards to Mayfield Road and that around the corner Bend that the foot of a mount that probably the worst those movies here through the chair those joint planning assessment meetings are conducted between council staff and the transport for New South Wales regarding the funding for the full coming year in terms of how that will be distributed or through the director Chris mr. Schumacher you 're got some heavy static happening there we just can 't hear you at all yeah so we 'll continue we 'll continue to advocate for all those particular projects through those particular forms but here 's transport for yourself while certainly are aware and yes I will continue to simply leave those up in projects with some funding and the final one was just below it from the wall in New South Wales of the McCrory drought relief strategy meeting appears to be a meeting so what happens with those yeah through the chair two different meetings the primary meeting with the Central Western area of councils looking at different strategies with you know drought relief and options moving forward with preserving water and you know what that can mean for opportunities specific to over and in the Urban 's abran space urban dam in supplying it or building a pipeline along with other you know mechanisms for you know again drought proofing oberyn 's options so that 's where those meetings certainly went in that space with putting that type of information forward to the state government for recommendation on you know priorities placement of drought funding options for over on council thank you thank you any other questions or queries on this one councillors house will play ball thank you madam mayor thank you just a late request on the replacement signs being pleaded I 've noticed in my travels that a lot of the guideposts well a number of the guideposts that have been replaced after some body runs over them have not been gathered up and brought back to whence they should be they just tossed off the side of the road that 's not good enough if we could if we can have them picked up and done something with that would be good you through the tea roll tape it on notice and look into that thank you Thank You councillor Capel any other comments on all in favor carry thank you page 99 item 1404 monthly activity report corporate services recommendation is that the report is received as information can I have a mover please can I have a mover place councillor McKibben and councillor Dhoni thank you because I McKibben I 'm thinking about a merry extensive report and it 's good to see that things are getting back to I think quite a general manager nearly normal or whatever in filming it was in a number of areas and their library and other areas are planning to increase their hours gradually as we get back to a more normal situation and let 's hope you don 't have a second wave of no name and the bottom of page 99 do we have a time frame as to we when we believe this investigation into subcategories across all writable lands in the over on local government area will be completed in the first quarter of the next financial year so looking to probably have a report to Council by October by the by the making in October that 's the onus okay thank to comment on Thank You council any recommendations thank you [Music] Thank You Man I 'm not sure we 're in the meeting I would make the appropriate comment but this is the last report from the directors though there are other items good to see the amount of work that continued to be done in someone that like the library under difficult circumstances but I would just like to make the comment that even though some councilors are not easy to get on with including myself I just think the volume of work that is being asked of our staff at the moment is really quite quite staggering and I compliment them on their their the size of the papers for this meeting is just something that you know we need more time to do it alone they I just think that through the the virus and through our demands and through the workload and through the requirements of other levels of government I 've really quite impressed and and thankful for the quality of the work that the staff of little ole over on Council and get fruit I 'll make it their turn Thank You council agreed with that sentiment any other comments on this one councillors for the recommendation all in favor carry thank you page 105 item 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is there that council received the reports for information can I have a mover place Caledonian councilman kick me Thank You councillor doning Council in McKibben and I would love to talk about this but my notice projections for interest rates we can expect to interest rates to stay extremely low the only decision that the government has in front of them at the mall the Reserve Bank has in front of them at the moment is whether to go to negative interest rates but nobody quite knows how to do that so Australia is trying to hold back from that situation with many other countries we 've entered there is nothing stimulating economic activity around the world at the moment except the printing of money quantitative easing whatever you want to call it and that money is obviously being distributed out to the through the banks to the people who can will continue to burn the stock market continues to rise against all common sense whatsoever house prices will continue to rise certain with the upper end through no common sense whatsoever and those who can afford to borrow will accumulate assets and those who can 't afford to borrow this is related to the interest we earn on our investments that we live in very strange economic times to think that really the only thing driving economic activity in the Western world at the moment our printing presses pushing our money for people to spend and let the inevitable result of that is just the rise in assets thank you madam me technique no no you admitted me I think we 've covered investments fairly thoroughly there already to save you Thank You counselor any other comments councilors recommendation all in favor Mary thank you page 108 item 1406 grants monthly update the recommendation is there that report is received as information the mover police counselors counsel McKibben and a seconder counselor capable Thank You councillor McEwan yes very very thorough report and note the results of grants and we and community infrastructure program and the five hundred ninety four thousand five hundred and fourteen obviously this will assist us in some areas I 'm just not quite sure of completely the guidelines which have to be obviously released and obviously we can 't draw up the short list of activities to undertake it in this program until we have those guidelines we have any idea when they 're going to be released that 's the top of page 109 yeah except they are eminently imminent to be released I don 't know manager mode anything diving with noting that funds funds are able to be accessed from the 1st of july 2021 with deep with the guidelines that have to come out fairly quickly one would think no I think I think the rest is is self-explanatory and yes we move on I mean obviously we 've the Acoma recreation ground rent which is they know it was great thank you ma 'am thank you thank you madam mayor thank you nothing further to add except to say that it 's good I thought that the funding of some after that what we 've been through over the last well nearly six months now but they 're still getting money back into add into the into the region so while ever while ever that continues good on them Thank You counselor any other comments on this one counselors I 'll put the recommendation all in favor carried thank you it 's 112 item 1407 water usage drought assistance the recommendation is there that item 07 be received and noted can I have a mover please councillor Callum Thank You councilman Kevin Elsa Callum please going to see that the usage of the standpipe is decreasing as people are recovering from the the drought Thank You councillor duddeck eben yes I 'd concur we 're today councillor KLM 's comment please to second the report thank you any other comments councillors I 'll put the recommendation all in favour Carrie thank you it 's 114 item 1408 water and sewer plant report the recommendation is that the report is received as information and other police councillors council Gibbons and councillor Callum Thank You councillor Gibbons very straightforward Thank You counsel recommendation all in favor carried thank you page 116 item 1409 legal and consultancy fees the recommendation is at the report item is received as information can I have a mover place councillor Dhoni a second please councillor Dhoni what you want to move an amendment to the its report for information correct I would like the discussion of this report moved to confidential okay and the reasons I would like it if the confidential relating to section 10 a 2 of the Local Government Act may be number a or letter a personal matters concerning particular individuals other than councillors yep possibly see may confer commercial advantage I 'm not sure about that but I 'm not sure all the details e and G because if there are personnel issues here then there may be legal implications that come up in any discussion and therefore they should not be in the public arena the reasons I would like to move it in to confidential is that in the workforce management plan that we 've looked at there are a number of objectives and goals where the the health of and the council and the number of the legal costs in here of such a size that I would only had like a little bit more discussion and possibly some of the plan in the costs as well as to how how we have incurred at that level of costs Thank You counselor is there a second up girls from the Cuban thank you I 'll put it to the meeting all inside up against Council McCarthy is against thank you motions carried that the move that item 1409 be carried across into confidential yeah yeah I was just going to ask you the relevance to what happened that 's my concern I I 'm not against counselor down a gallon of confidential but I think say on an item loosen subdivision it should be itemized what what it was for and I don 't think that has to go into confidential there must be some relevance to seeking that advice that was all well I think the counselor MacArthur and counselor Dhoni did outline his concerns of questions he wants to ask that he can 't maybe not asking all right you take a lead mm consulting expert cleaning advice we we don 't know what it was for now is it for that one in the six-foot walkin tackle is that a final Road or whatever it should be some rep reference to what it 's for I 'll take that unnoticed counsel McCarthy but the resolution has been moved in and with successful to move it into confidential so that 's what will happen we 're now on page 117 counselors item 15 and there is no urgent business this evening page 117 item 16 closed session confidential reports in accordance with the Local Government Act 1993 and the local government general regulation 2005 in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kind as referred to in Section 10a bracket 2 of the Act and should be dealt with in part of the meeting close to the media and the public I 'd like to

culture of the elders both past and present as i said welcome councillors and welcome to our community that are joining us by zoom tonight item two on your business paper page four record of attendance we have several applications for leave of absence this evening um councillor dhoni councillor kellum and councillor mckibben um can i have someone to move that that leave of absence be granted council capital and councillor mckechnie thank you all in favor harry thank you and damian o 'shaughnessy planning and development director is also an apology this evening item three page four declarations of interest are there any declarations of interest this evening none thank you confirmation of the minutes works committee meeting minutes of the works committee meeting held on the 8th of september 2020 uh follow can i have someone to move those minutes please from the report the author of this explain how we had a young fellow hit with followed the driver into the yard apparently or where the driver pulled up and then when he made a claim we went to this um telemetry thing and that they were told that the truck was in the yard when the actual driver of the truck actually acknowledged that he was the younger followed him up so how did we get a mix-up when someone made the inquiry that the state was made the truck was in the yard all the time wasn 't_''_154.16 out the road that 's correct um what happened was we got the complaint i looked up the the gps system yep it definitely showed that the truck was in the yard we had a a second vehicle for some some reason checked that and then said it was in the yard and i knew in fact it wasn 't in here so i got onto the um to the gps um what 's the main pinpoint who managed the gps system and there was a glitch in the system the system had stalled on that particular vehicle for for a couple of days and it days when in fact it wasn 't i rang the uh the people and i apologized to him i said look there 's been there has been a glitch on it he wasn 't the uh he was where you say he was and he was there at the time and that uh super decline and uh i 'm not worried about the claim i 'll just want to spend the money that this system isn 't working well shiny glitch would have had it she obviously would have been an issue with the gps mob 's computer system that showed it as a fault yeah i i give credit to this kid that he actually pursued the vehicle because he 's he 's only a young kid and with insurance that yeah it wasn 't his fault and and our staff member that said that he didn 't know what fell off but he said it could and i said well it 's strange because the system showing your work but as it turned out it was it was a glitch in the system thank you very much so you haven 't used it already you 're about to use it again down at oregon lane to do the uh last fifty percent of the planning okay thank you another comments questions i 'll put the recommendation all in favor carrie thank you reports page 13 0501 proposed purchase of mobile traffic lights the recommendation is the council purchase one complete set of mobile traffic lights from a1 road lines provided limited for 42 321 plus gst and that council fund is purchased from the internal restricted engineering instruments budget and reports pretty straightforward and if it doesn 't have two people doing traffic control that should be an asset but um just because we 've got some old ones they either should be upgraded or made to work as well and we 've got two other sets yet through the chair we have and we 've certainly gone down the path of acquiring the modules to actually upgrade those um for the same tape well near enough the same capability what they possibly can to be adapted to so they will be still of some use um this various activities on that particular project and or uh other longer-term larger projects that we are going to embark on very shortly thank you oh yes i support the recommendation um council mccarthy but just a question from the note that they 're not registered the traders is is the registration um fee i don 't know how we pay our registration fees or what where the account is but the 42 321 does that cover the registration the insurance for two trials uh through the chair i say no to that uh however the fee would be for like unconditional type registration which uh is not of a great value other than probably a couple hundred dollars tops which come if you have the traffic lights up and say there 's a campbell 's river job going on do you have to have a support vehicle running through and back you would not have to would you uh through the chair certainly depending on what the activities or how many multiple activities were happening at one time transport from new south wales are going down the path of mandatory traffic control is a requirement they 're going to request off any council that is in a race maintenance council contract arrangement with the state government so it 's probably not a bad practice to have but again it doesn 't mean that we need to be tying up resources unnecessarily either with respect to your question and just further question i can see that holding the job 's up a bit i know it goes away with a couple of legs uh control of the traffic which is very handy when you 're there and you can ask them is that traffic coming through on a smaller job like campbell 's river but the other thing it holds the gravel trucks up it 's there 's a red light bull they 've naturally got to stop until the traffic comes through from another distance so you certainly lose productivity with them that might make up for having you know we 've got two well-trained blacks there and we 've got there 's been three jobs going at the one stage and canvas river and that doesn 't happen too at each one whereas there might be certain instances where a better system is having the controllers there but no objections to this particularly if the lights are a bit more modern than the other ones and they don 't have to be really depending on the activities and all those resourcing that 's required on any one time um it 's not necessarily always a need to to be running you know um with regard to traffic lights we certainly will help but uh certainly not the only cost um it 's lost my training thought sorry with regard to the traffic control um it it it can insult the pilot vehicle actually be beneficial obviously instead of having one two people i mean just having the one person in a pilot vehicle arrangement um through a particular activity or a job site um so it really depends on the toolbox that 's happening happening on the day on on the job site really into the outcome of where the physical traffic control or traffic light should be implemented on whatever activity this building where it 's coming from be needed because these traffic controllers our own blokes they 're brilliant they 'll tell you when the car is coming and when they 're held up at bit vehicles when you 're turning around the great or something on an arrow it 's certainly flowing well there but there 's three two or three separate operations so yeah depending on the nature of the problem think about it um just on the um on the comments that were given to us i 'm not entirely convinced that i support this idea um there are a few unanswered questions that somebody might be able to help me with 40 48 or 40 whatever 42 and [Music] you mentioned that hiring is difficult at the moment because there 's so many of them in use around the place i 'm sure if we wanted to hire either long-term term or as needs we 'd be able to come to an arrangement with some sort of a supplier to to do us do that for us i don 't know what the cost of that would be um somebody else might be no i 've got no idea how much we 're looking at as far as maintenance on these things go there 's a lot of batteries and bits and pieces i gather just by reading the comments um yeah so so an idea of the maintenance and the life of the of the plant would be handy uh also i didn 't realize that we already own some sets of lights um how many sets of lights do we own and while they might be used uh frequently just at the moment um year in year out how much use do they get it does say in the body of the report that we are true yeah yes yeah sorry so through the chair the current sets that we own are pover vinnies that are getting on certainly up to 10 years old it was anticipated to as part of the plant replacement program replace a set next financial year but given the current circumstances of the workload bringing it forward to get it out of this year 's budget is the primary reason uh yes they are obviously again another reason the maintenance regime on these things is not heavily involved in terms of you know a lot of cost to keep them in a condition yes they do need to check in over at least once or twice annually and they are of a solar solid capacity so the batteries and like are certainly the main components components that need checking um so we you know whilst we do have a lot of work on we also use them on maintenance projects um from time to time and i see it as an advantage you know not probably even selling uh the ones we do have in the yard as the older aged finish type ones it 's probably to run them to a point where you know the parts all they know are no longer worth the the arrangement of fixing i would say or suggest so that is probably why one of the main reasons why we 're trying to bring this forward to assist in in also reducing the need for physical uh traffic control uh predominantly on this campbell river road job which is stage that helps fair enough any other comments from this encounter comfortably through your madame just make a comment these particular lights [Music] they have the ability to to work at a greater distance because part of the part of the deal there 's a repeater station in between they also have the the ability to be able to be operated by the escort vehicle so if you are involved with an escorted vehicle you can switch them on and off from the vehicle or switching from red red to green from the vehicle depending on fish travels so we don 't have that capability in any of the systems we 've got the kimball river road project which extends over at quite a distance we 'll have the table winds way which extends over quite a distance and hopefully which extends over quite a distance [Music] the other the other problem we face at the moment is we can 't hire lights we pride every council is screaming up for them like we are and we looked everywhere we did manage to get a set but it 's not to operate the light from the vehicle but it 's not over a long distance it doesn 't have that capability okay 502 page 23 new concrete past construction program 2020-21 the recommendation is that report item 502 be received as information outlining proposed concrete footpath construction to be completed by june 2021 can i have a movement please counselor take me in a second announcement paper thank you councilman should i speak to this one oh yes very pleased to see this report in there as we probably know i 've been on about this sense even before the last work committee meeting in november and uh i appreciate input from from kristen and um and in coming to to speak to me about it so pleased to see there um i 'm so sure these um these streets are listed in this table um they 're the stretch that people have been approaching me um specifically scotia avenue but also the connection between [Music] the footpath and fleming street across to cunningham street to access the new um fitness centre and also the sporting precinct over there the 's missing and the other ones in cunningham street are the links from the new north street footpaths down to that same area and also for that area to the high school and onto ross street so i think it 's it 's a good report and it 's a good matrix of the the issues that have been raised by residents in town and some of the teachers at the schools very pleased to see it there and and more than happy to to propose it thank you that 's okay i 'm very pleased to see these and these particular ones um coming up for some footpaths and before i was on the council when the council had the consultants coming in the uh what the name of it was yeah that was one of the things that they highlighted the lack of footpaths in in oberon and i know the council has gone a significant way to um to doing something about that with a lot more footpaths now than we did have um and this will only add to it and particularly i 'm pleased to fitness centre um a footpath leading through the center it is getting a huge amount of use um and if people can can walk then make it easier for people to walk along there it is a bit difficult um walking on the grass sometimes and the slope is not always ideal i come in the recommendations thank you council any other comments on this one council yeah um just the last one karen i wrote i 'm just concerned about the trees that are down there at the moment up along behind dr perkins close still in darren road we 're busting the footpath there with the three roots you think in some of these cases where there 's been no part there that some of the trees might be worth removing and replacing them as we do the concrete path with them so we don 't bust the paths through the chair it certainly don 't be a decision for council i i i can 't really comment in terms of the removal but what i can say that they are in my view of a mature state would be doable and i think shouldn 't impact those trees by really great means anyway in terms of the built up or the availability of space contained within the footpath area so again look at a decision on council if they see that the tree should be removed but i think that they are a reasonably healthy state and mature state that you know shouldn 't really have an impact either way in terms of root jacking on that one football extension okay and the other one is we 've done some work up in springfield street um as you go off north street what 's the stunt being left there for is that a memorial or whatever there 's a stunt about that high uh goodness we should have took it out when we 're digging the footpaths that didn 't stick out to me so i 'll just wrap it up [Music] country bridges grant 2020-21 the recommendation is that the report item is received as information can i have a mover please counselor given thank you and a second of those councillors mccarthy thank you council 've been able to replace these bridges um and bridge washed away is there any chance that the decking on the solar nest bridge may be up with sail or we 've talked about bringing it back in the storage because i 'm just something that we might be able to talk later on something done some damage around the places um pretty straightforward done just where do we get those 50 000 per bridge from what source of fun are you through the chair it 's a source of funding will come from race recovery recovery can be can be utilized in this case thank you comments councils the recommendation all in favor works program progress update 2020-21 the recommendation is that report item be received as information can i have a move no it 's a massive workload for for the year the summer and we 're plowing through it and um a lot of this has been completed and there 's a lot more to guys [Music] a big program thank you any other comments um we spoke with chris today but can we find funds in road from junior hill road through the other bitumen the bitumen like as you 've seen this afternoon and road 's in pretty bad state all the way through are you excited about those um yeah at this stage but there are probably some uh funding or fun funding opportunities through race recovery where that possibly could be considered by account another comments councilors i was just going to comment that since we have been declared a disaster area there might be some funding coming up for things like that with a little bit of luck and i think that 's why the um director will take it on notice now the comments councilman 's it has the same problems all the time and uh it needs widening and drainage because it 's lost a lot of gravel in this last these rain events just recently the other day and uh that 's a real good link road from from the one bitsman road to the other through there and uh just through the chair that um council has recently been declared a natural disaster area under the under the out there looking at where all the damage is and we 'll need to put together a program around through the portal if we meet that magic number in which um we need to meet in order to get a to get that assessed so it 'll i think carrie also summed it up the road needs widening for the traffic it 's increased on thank you thank you any other comments counselors okay counselors i 'll put the recommendation all in favor thank you okay counselors i 'm going to bring forward item 7 general business we have one closed and confidential one confidential report at which point in time the general public will leave which means we don 't do general business before that general public are not privy to what we 're talking about so i 'm going to bring them forward either 7 general business i sent an email around asking for general business to be notified to the general manager to enable a report or to information to be available we didn 't get any any um enquiries is there anything from the floor just there at lunchtime and we 're hiring that is would there be an opportunity to think that we should look at purchasing one we 've got a lot of roadworks coming up and it 's very tight he 's got nice toilets there we can heat up some meals there and it 's a little tidy i 'm not too sure what it is a day or something but it may be worth considering having our own with the amount of you have to have a site on on your jobs these days so that 's one thing thought um with regards to the campbell 's river crossing that uh [Music] mckibben just mentioned earlier i don 't think it 's been a big cost to do what we 're doing there over the bridge we 've certainly improved the approaches and there 's no saying we 're going to get the greens i suppose i haven 't heard that we have and to have left that 300 metres on either side of that bridge we already had a tune up with the amount of vehicles having to turn around road as it was so you know put a few loads of gravel on it and tied it up and fixed the super elevation up on the bridge so it had been a real weak link if we hadn 't done anything there so i think we 've always planned to do that always plan to do oh i thought there was i think there 's always always numbers that 's the only thing numbers are a bit shorter can we look at yeah i don 't know contract gardening uh to help out with numbers or i just think the amount of roadworks we 've got on i feel they 're a bit stressed am i right or through the chair we 're looking at those issues constantly yeah a very busy time other than that [Music] thank you council given any i know where this fits in the works or not but we need to secure the uh norway bushfire shed some some way whether you 're going to secure it through the worst thing or general council meeting but here um we don 't want to go the choir and land and all this this um sheds there um it 's suitable it 's been updated so we need to throw some resources and try and work out with the forestry if you 're telling us that that lot of land has no building permit on it um yeah we should be approaching the forestry with that and uh find out where they got the evaluation from yeah we should be making approaches so we can secure that side so through the chair i 'm in consultation with forest as we speak about that how about the norway um the other one was what pipes on carl road took out with chris but i 'll speak to the works manager how can we stop this granite getting into these brand new pipes isn 't it better that we have a cement plinth around it or a bit of um environmental overlays like that that one down there near the car would um what do you call it something in the creek cinder valley creek people only lasted the first storm we got to do it better there it 's not as if we short of money to do it surely goodness we can 't can 't_''_1834.24 we put the pipes in and raise it up so the water enters and the silt stays there yeah through the chair certainly as i indicated today the council is on that tour that um certainly needs some work on the table drones and in doing that yeah if there 's money permitting after the widening of that culvert which we 've committed to to do then certainly further materials need to be recompacted in those table drains and fully sealed at least to act as a carrier i think of water for the short term anyway until further funding fuel roof funding is actually indeed required but this may that may be enough just to fix that problem i think yeah i understand that but we put the culvert in now we 've got the reworker to clean it out someone 's gonna have to clean that out whether you fire a water truck to blast it out or something gets out of the long shovel or whatever i don know and to me if someone put that mesh around there three or four hours and begged it down we we might be in this position that 's all yeah through the chair your points taken i think that i 'll notice thank you givens mr just commenting on those types of things will always get more washed when the job 's ruled and just been done although they must settle down but i 'm in favor of the calm winds either with rocks and then and we 're going to page 30 item six post session and confidential report the accordance was allowed to government act 1993 in the loads of government general regulation 2005. in the opinion of the general manager the following business is of a kind as referred to in section

the o 'connell valley ng group in relation to consultation undertaken by the group in development of concept plans for the o 'connell recreation ground welcome lauren where is yours thank you um yes i haven 't_''_188.72 met before um i 'm patricia and i 'm the chairperson of the kamala community group um and one of the things that we were really keen to do was be proactive with the design of the wreck lounge we have a long history with working with council and we 're really excited when the land became available and we understand the process of the council having a consultant from things and we just wanted to do our own consultation and i guess get on the front foot and tell me some of the things that the community you know um have envisaged for that area lauren 's going to go just through the process that we undertook and then i 'll explain a bit more about the map thank you thank you so um as trish said um we wanted to be on the platform and we also wanted to assist council with developing news as hustlers it was very [Music] exciting so to ensure that we got um a really good uh cover of the community to get good feedback we went out to the valley university page we also went out to the oklahoma valley members and we also went to the oklahoma valley public schools so we had a really good cross-section of the community providing that important survey which is very impossible and in total next slide we 've got 122 responses which great response so we looked at the survey but it was introduced to ensure that everyone knew that the council had a process to go through that they must you know just ask tell them what we want and we believe there actually is a process that does go through in developing such something like this exercise so they were told that it was a consultant was going to develop a master plan and master plan will begin by areas and opportunities for improvement to accommodate the rain sporting recreational continuing investments into the future meaning that it 's not going to happen all of us could be very much staged sections of this and the advice america is going to be located and then you also talked about it has natural undulations and topography that was obviously considered in the design as well that wasn 't going to be flattened that the screening will be provided for the neighbours because there is a section of the land that attacks into a good corner within the green and that needs to be protected and then a cricket pitch had already take that out of their thoughts knowing full well that that was the first thing that 's actually going to be done it 's just proof themselves so the survey covered off the slide we wanted to know um how many children live in the household of the 122 responses we got with no children who was 34 with one to two who were 46 the two to four was 30 and four class school is 12 which i think is fairly representative of our current community there is a lot of children and the growing community [Music] children they 're wearing area because they are probably the major users of their background and the future and then we asked if the children attended common public school and that 's important because the school is probably one of the key users of the background when it gets developed i don 't want to get bridge happening but um patricia will have ways to get the children to use that background but they certainly will be major use of because the community values it from time to time for different reasons children are changing within their hunting we 've got 106 responses discovering that there 's 37 that do have primary school and 69 of china but there 's also older children within households that go into that then we found we wanted to know how many people participated in sporting activities or physical activity and um we 've done just under 50 percent um undertaking our daily exercise and sporting activities and then second behind that was just like 42 weeks of monthly and the community um and then we asked would they or other family members use the recreation ground and there 's an overwhelming response that 1970 122 would you like to see available on the stage when building the common valley ground and the top uh response was an athletics walking or running chat and that 's also something that traditionally children are quite keen on was football and soccer and then um very closely with rugby and good practice and then there was a other that sort of ranked quite highly and it turned out that tennis is one of the popular choices between the other in the next slide you will see that tennis actually comes out very strongly as um outdoor sports courts that i would like to have available followed by um [Music] what other facilities they 'd like to see part of this master plan another stage um and top of the list was an amenities block second was community forum which is something that 's different from our theme currently we do used to have um the church available to us as you know to set that focus that that 's uh been taken away so a community wall is different [Music] adventure playground and outdoor fitness machines um we didn 't ask would they like to see the new recreation ground linked to castle park and again we have an overwhelming response i think that 's just leaving all that [Music] so from those results we then uh invested quite a bit of money um to produce a plan which you all have a copy of to um to show to you our commitment as a community and what we would like to see built and how excited we are think trish can take us through the actual design um so you can see some of the things that came through were um the the oval and where it would be located and you 'll see that they put um a running track of maybe an l4 hoping to get four there 's four lanes around the outside of the oval they 've got an idea of having that um a natural amphitheater uh with shade trees rather than a structure a grandstand type structure more of a natural amphitheatre and a lot of that ideas that that came out to around the um i don 't know if any of you 've been to the fisheries festival but the natural amphitheater behind the pub that has the trees and that 's also currently there it is built a couple times a year um moving up to the car park space um coming in off that the beaconsville road and they allow for 84 car park spaces based on the size of the community hall um we were sort of looking at a community hall of around um that seated that hundred um to 120 so having a big enough size for growth but also not making it too big that it is never filled or has the atmosphere of the community before and you 'll see up in the left-hand corner just some in negative designs for the hall just to give you an idea its placement is so that when you 're driving all over the road and you look up it doesn 't block the car call or the church so those architectural features can be seen from bakersfield road so it 's set back on the southern side but that it would have the same similar angles and lines and be built in sympathy with the buildings already in that precinct and the same would go for the amenities block if the building could be simply built in a sympathetic manner to that historical precinct the pathways that you see link the um the path that 's already established thank you very much along the avenue of trees and so they the walkers currently when they do their walk they walk around the block and then and being able to wander down and then at the other end there 's also a little the dotted lines down in that corner upon a load um where the pedestrian entry is those indicate where the anzac installation that is the anzac day and remembrance day the community erect a memorial installation that have been blue flags and it 's not just given through any of those times and then it 's the children are very much involved with that installation and it comes down between those times so that it 's not as it 's not static it 's just at that time um so we did think that um creating an an o 'connell avenue memorial sign would also be fitting in that sort of space because as pedestrians leave they enter the memorial we have all the brass plaques ready for that so it 's uh half of that 's already been waiting um the tennis courts you 'll see there 's actually two tennis courts for the enthusiasm of everyone wanting tennis but also as the school it 's much easier to organize friday sport a lot of problems that sort of restricts the usage but two thoughts um means that it can be much more active and also with evening competitions and things friendly social tennis it 's always fun to have two ports going on those ports you can see in light blue there are other markings and that 's where we tried to cater for the basketball and netball people so that there 'd be other markings on there not necessarily that they might have a game but at least they could practice shooting hoops and things off the end of the tennis courts we 've tried to incorporate those other sports in with the tennis the little green we 've looked at putting some um [Music] screening in the way of trees and that 's also where um for a better place we put the cricket nets over to that side too um i think that 's basically the juice juice of things um there 's a lot of this has been to the our meeting a couple of times um just to clarify and change the aid so that everyone with the originally with the architects for a couple of hours just to brainstorm what we thought um where things would go with adventure playgrounds um but because we 've got that wonderful one that 's covered down at um the castle park you 'll see there 's a landscaped area up near the church and that is probably our idea of having a natural playground um that 's more earthy and forest orientated so it 's it 's not made out of great or typing that it would be large granite pops and whatever else we can do that 's that 's allowable um so it was yeah more of a landscaped area that would occupy children if someone was playing sport they could go and get lost in some trees and lock some family spiders and bugs and talk to the snakes um so many questions thank you would i recommend the um community group that 's an excellent plan um just a couple of questions obviously the lower area there is subject for flooding so are we raising the oval on the bottom the drainage and things there was drainage with that proposal of the drainage so we just figured the drainage would work sufficiently it doesn 't flood um i mean it 's probably 50 and maybe 100 years rather flooded hugely um but i think that the drainage that they were looking at well the bottoms the bottom sides probably it would be the only side affected and it looks like that most of the infrastructure is on the top side so we 'd be honest yeah um bearing in mind this is obviously a long-term project in our minutes obviously for the future with the screening of liberal brain when you 're looking at sort of using um you 're looking at using some appropriate screen trees like bullalosa or something that 's longwood rather than playland it seems to be quite pervasive and that he 's actually been appointed she is a wrong state architect so i think so yeah the types of trees and things and yeah because everyone 's obviously got a free policy committee at the moment we 're looking very carefully over on the villages um brenda is very we 're looking at you know obviously beautification is very important so um good working with that committee also um and with the the new community hall um look i can then the roof line looks as though it 's obviously aligned with all the existing churches are very important um and i 'm not sure whether it 's appropriate or not or whether sometimes it 's good to have the contrast but if that 's up to you yeah and um that 's a valid point in that the two architects who give this uh um leon is predominantly a building architect um she does a lot of work in um doing just that melding the old with the new and she was very um up front and said sometimes it 's best to um for ease of construction of things use newer the new materials um but materials are synthetic with the so whether it 's um some iron wood glass um you 'll see that it has two breakout areas yeah and so that they can um there was a lot of natural light but that was too stuck on um making it look like it 's always been there because it can have beauty in being a new build so that was the actual materials and things that are still being discussed um the other thing is i know you 've got a sort of [Music] [Music] um and obviously things like irrigation and other and obviously potential power lines um i 'm just wondering whether you consider moving the um netball courts or sports up against the band you say the first deal with my colleagues so they just sort of prior to that that build but i think there in close enough proximity that they could well and truly yeah use them for that there 's no gate drawn just congratulate where they 're moving with this and you can feel the enthusiasm for this and and as i said young village and taking about 50 years when black springs are doing all this sort of stuff [Music] you 've got another just one more um and this is just about the name of the um even the reference up and just the oval new it 's always nice to find a little history about that area and it was a local sportsman but i understand that there 's a process that needs to be gone through so the community would like to get involved when that comes back sometime in the future and look forward to some suggestions for you some good suggestions and i will help people to understand more about the community that they live in and history [Music] congratulations thank you so much um um yeah so through the through the mayor the round one funding where the the cricket ground drainage works is required by the end of december 2022 but by undertaking this process you 'll note that um council 's keen to see this progress in a you know in a way that we can move that a little bit quicker than that time frame um we 've engaged our landscape architect and the landscape architects in fact met with the group already um she has a copy of this um plan and she was excited by the fact that this is stuff to get your head so we 'll be relying on her expertise in terms of the types of plantings that would be required but this is a huge step forward in trying to progress that that master plan there will be a level of confusion i think that someone 's developed a plan and someone 's coming out to have a look at it but that 's up to us to make sure that that 's well um well versed and able for people to recognize that this is what we 're working towards but yeah that 's where it 's up to thank you guys nice i will go back to our meeting counselors page six counselors [Music] questions from the public there are no questions from the public this evening councillors confirmation minutes item eight page six ordinary meeting 16th of february 2021 you have the minutes i will just note before i the mayor provides the following response it should read this is an operational matter not an operation matter in item two and three we

recommendation that the report item is received as information remove the police counsellors thank you [Music] uh laura white uh is inquiring how um she could change the lep and this response has been provided [Music] um [Music] to introduce themselves basically and to um let council know that they 're willing to work with councils it 's a pretty general type of meeting um and it was practically duplicated that country notifications item 1001 independent living units promotion is the reporter or reports be provided to council in relation to the development of the independent living units in curtis street upon finalization of the project can i have a move of those councilmen in a second place thank you madam mayor i think the reasons for those emotions speak to themselves um i realize that some of the questions i 've asked as i have said in the reasons may be in a confidential uh basis and i do expect that the answers in particular to the specific area under reasons g would probably come back under a closed session of council or confidential sessions with the nature of the responses that will be required um but i think it 's an everything in our interest as um councillors to understand why the delay and the reasons for the delay with the recommendation console and delegates reports council 's page 12 item 1101 over on business and tourism association agm and general meeting 10th of february 2021 the recommendation is that the report has received this information can i have a 's place that 's looking good mr papel thank you um uh [Music] association

years lobbying the state government were included and also interesting the comments in relation to solar [Music] very informative and obviously excellently represented these organizations and to get the lab from a number of people is it correct that yeah right so he actually raised some you know some interesting points um i was a little alarmed with the shortage of gps in the rural areas it got between 15 and 20 percent over the past 20 years quite a lot it has been a issue of concern for a very long time over lots of these kinds of meetings i mean i think some centers are relatively isolated from it i mean orange seems to seem to have a fairly i mean they 've got more orthopedic surgeons than they used to 20 years ago i 'm sure that they wrong um and there 's quite a few now but some areas aren 't west it 's just [Music] any other comments page 34 councillors items 401 overall sports facilities community the recommendation is that the minutes of the overall sports facilities committee held on the 10th of february 2021 be received and noted can i have a moving place council faith in the country yes we do i believe it 's councillor gibbons thank you so much for watching i 'm sorry friend of mine that 's the line she took the job on when i resigned last time um [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] and through the chair i can confirm that i was remote as well and i had the same problem so i have i in fact come back and ended the changes to have that discussion so it was a there was some issues that day with the connectivity is um through the chair now there was a there was a it was supposed to be a split but there 's there was enough people in the chambers to have a call on that the a very very important part of the community and while i understand council mckinney 's inability to to zoom in um [Music] people are actually suggesting things so i 'm actually [Music] um um [Music] age 38 counsellors item 1202 traffic advisory local committee the recommendation used at the minutes of the traffic advisory local committee meeting held on the 11th of february 2021 i received as information and i had a moving place [Music] and have them reposition so it 's intended to have 50 kilometers all the way through black springs he 's intended to have 60 kilometres all the way through experience that there was a bit of an issue with the uh congestion of road signs but the congestion road signs speak to the chair pleasure yeah through the chair uh and that was raised because of a number of signs road signs congested around the near black springs welcome to that site on the other coming in from um um i think you go straight into 50 but then you 're coming out of the abercrombie road you go 50 then 50 to 60 and we really need a 50 in black springs this has to be two i understand you are in certain towns to have the 60th there 's no anyway i don 't know but it does seem i always think it 's a little um interesting going 50s and 60s and 100 in quite a short period of time i 'm not suggesting obviously policeman yet we 've got him in the data [Music] so through the map um i think some of this information was um relayed out to members of top prior to the absolute committee being held get some feedback and comment he was speaking with new south wales any other application 10207 one three two four blue pill right o 'connell i will just clarify that on page 41 of this report councillors i 'm sorry item a21 and a26 that should read a dwelling can be located suitably on proposed lot two and the same in a26 it should say plot two will be suitable for a future page item a21 and a26 okay counselors there 's a recommendation here that policy of approved modification of two dot four being a modification for a four lot subdivision on lot two in dp one two six five nine three two being known as two bloom hill road o 'connell in accordance with section 4.16 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 and the modified conditions contained within this report for the following reasons hey the proposed modifications are considered to result in minimal environmental impact and is substantially the same development as the originally approved development thereby satisfying the requirements of sections 4.551a a and bracket b of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979. b those modifications comply with the requirements of the applicable applicable environmental planning instruments and over on development control plan 2001. we see the proposed modifications are considered satisfactory in terms of the matters identified in section 4.15 of the environmental planning and assessment act 1979 ii the division being called in accordance with section 375a of the local government act 1993 and i have a mover please what 's with helen a casual carter thank you house of commons [Music] [Music] um [Music] councillors use [Music] um there are just i did specifically i think the first one on [Music] exhaustively explained that [Music] age 50. that says it does not locations visual location sites while is at the moment you know falls road and that we might consider over time in our development um really making suggestions like buffers or tree additional tree locations of [Music] koala specific trees we 've got included in our development approvals to encourage people to facilitate that as i said it is adjacent to the the spot where um you know kuala lumpur [Music] in such a manner when in fact that 's the cause of the commercial transaction um page 58 and i 'm just asking for clarification here where there 's no environmental impact of koala 's water sources it talks about it building off the local essential column building you know i 'm not saying they should do building envelopes in this area fixed or through the chair they would be floating a future development application for a house would need to take into consideration the very things i 'd see that and sometimes we use a building because in saying it 's sure it puts more pressure on the planner at the time [Music] says [Music] um [Music] [Music] mature um how we how we put that into place is that likely to occur through the chair absolutely um and 60 65 the restriction to user is it there 's a couple of others down here but i 've been really pleased with um recommendations page 67 councils item 1302 local roads and community infrastructure program extension funding allocation phase 2 recommendation in four parts the council allocate three hundred and sixteen thousand three hundred sixteen thousand five hundred twenty dollars for the reconstruction of one point two kilometers of view as well the council will provide 180 000 towards the upgrade of the amenities of the overall hearing pool the council provide direction as to the residual thirty thirty five thousand three hundred and ninety four dollars to the above two projects the council submit nominations to the lrci program by the 31st of march 2021 to ensure fiscal completion and project acquittal by the 30th december 2021 and i have them over the place thousands of people it but i think so i degrees [Music] okay [Music] thank you so councilman and councillor kellen are still the movers we 're dealing with using four [Music] thousand five twenty dollars for the reconstruction of one point two kilometers of unions hill road do i have them can i move an amendment against that particular one and put forward a proposal do you wish to speak to those or do you wish to move an amendment before anybody speaks to them i 'd like to speak to the amendment before we go any further but i 'll go the way whatever 's the right way to go you lose an amendment you can move it now we 'll discuss that first before we discuss promotion but if you if you want to move an amendment what is your amendment you have to [Music] i 'm happy with the funding to go to that road by looking hard at what we need to do there we might get another one we have the amendment council given she needs to write the amendment out so you want to reduce the width created along the road council gary [Music] we just need to include the parts about the allocation of how much money into that amendment as well yes so reduce the reduced error to produce kilometers needs to come back to six meters i also reduce the width of movements will road to a six meters single week to allow additional seating to be created along the road to the value [Music] i 'm sure that would possibly give the engineer an opportunity to do another kilometer through the chair just based on that i i can 't guarantee that it 's going to be a kilometer of that because we haven 't looked at that assessment but if it 's up to cancer to debate thank you thanks for giving yes okay [Music] for the following reasons for making a seven metre biscuit road you obviously gotta have shoulders to obtain the seven metres um which could be you know the rate could be seven and a half or eight meters and that the catchment increases because you 're widening the road and uh when it rains you 've got a smaller road uh you 'll lessen the impact of the runoff the road is winding in nature and while widening it more i think we 're going to entice increased speed on the road it 's a 30 kilometer an hour ride at the best if you want to have a look at this this is it chris is it this yeah yes you 'll see that it 's it 's a it 's a steady road whichever way you go there 's a grade there and there 's a number of bends along there and we 'll talk about that in a minute and uh the existing road that 's there and technical services know it 's between five to six to even seven meters as it exists at the most and that 's the basis of your road if you 've got to start increasing without wider being an earth mover i know that that extra meter or two meters is where the big dollars cost because you 've got an existing road there you 've got batters you 've got fields you 've got to fill 's where the savings a lot of dollars could come where we could uh increase the bits when along the road it would require a lot of earthworks for seven meter rage and uh very expensive a seven meter road with you 've noticed the same driving with as the highways and major aids you 've got three and a half metres from the center line to your fog line that carries all their log trucks i don 't think we need it on this secondary road and this is not necessary for quite steady district road here are some sealed road widths in our shire now david road is 5.4 meters the beaconsfield road is 5.2 to 6.2 down towards the o 'clock reserve avenue is five meters traffic downs are six meters titanium at harris road is six metres fair view road with twenty houses thirty houses six metres rudders read their flight weight 5.6 to 6 metres peter bridge at the foot of the hill 6.1 metres on a major road hurricane 6.2 in farmhouse these roads were all hundred kilometer an hour roads and i just food we 've got a lot of work to do on erosion there i could see savings that we could put in to get more bitsmen done along the road and i 'm sure that the farmers down that way it 'd be much happier that they have a real dust problem there and i just believe it 's the right way to go cars are only 2.2 meters wide and you get two cars an hour there i just think it 's a bit of an overkill and i 'd rather be a bit prudent than extravagant so that 's the reasons and if you look here i think the engineer may say we 've got to knock on our tree here if we 're going to try and get the whip and i just don 't think it 's necessary but i 've numbered these number five or the middle one on the front or the back well both ones you can yeah you can widen that section quite easily and it 's not because but you can get an extra bit of width or i 'm happy degrees where it 's so i just think that 's my point i 'd like to see a six meter road thank you thank you you know perspective as well if they 're concerned thank you can i just ask for a comment in the director of the services um good premise of i suppose through traffic can sometimes be diverted down this road not that it 's desirable but at times can be required in the event of a motor vehicle accident or some other conditions that weren 't about to do so the issue from the technical perspective is really to get the water off the road as you can see in some of these pictures the road is quite lower than the surrounding property so in the view of drainage being very important to any road work and yeah they also take into account councillor engines comments regarding you know some roads around the shires are of a significant standard which is lesser than probably what we would typically see today as an australian standard so there 's some accounts there that that council we need to know take all views on board uh it is a country road no doubt about that um but again this has been based on some australian standards and some of those um particular points of view particularly getting water or water off that road is really the paramount objective of you know unless it 's lessening the frequency or costs um involved with ongoing maintenance four minutes or road thank you yeah [Music] are we saying that if we make this road six meters that we aren 't going to be able to have we 're still going to have to be able to raise the road as i understand so that it 's higher than surrounding land and we 're still going to have to make appropriate table grounds each side so if we do that appropriately will it be any major difference in the longevity of the road being a six meter seal on top so it 's still going to be um what uh six and a half meters to seven meters in width for a six meter seal okay is that right certainly that 's that of a substantial amount of reduction in longevity of this road if it 's reduced to a six-man seal over a seven metre city and i haven 't got the priority road matrix with me which indicates the usage of this road maybe someone could assist me with that as to what sort of usage this road has in relation to school buses trucks cars etc [Music] certainly trying to see that we reduce the actual longevity but it 's not saying that it wouldn 't it couldn 't be a bus rather than the future if uh it was so required to do so it 's really when you come to those bends certainly the wider the road in the australian standards is paramount so that needs to be taken into consideration um yes there are locations there where it can be wider and so that 's what council really needs to take into consideration making this decision through the through the chair if i could add new until road i think is it 's definitely in the top 10 of your i think it sits about eight don the top ten yeah i can 't remember i don 't think we had a truck here we only ever had correct development opportunities and i think there was um it gained points from the fact that there was private plantation on noon tour road [Music] um uh to do the job properly [Music] yeah i don 't have an exact um scientific account as uh in terms of daily use but um certainly would be a lot less on the eastern end being this section of road as opposed to the western is that very small residual risk that exists by having a slightly narrower load and we get the benefit of having a single road in an area which has potential for more traffic but it 's there to save us money in the world we have the comments now there are kilometers but the biggest thing of this is the environmental impact on the edge of the road the wash i think we have a letter from a landholder down there that measured a depression in the road where his neighbour [Music] [Music] um like you start you have to have them but when we 're improving a smaller road they were standing with a six metre seal i don 't think the australian standards are so important but i do think because we 're working with a six metre soil instead of a bigger road i think it gives you a bit better opportunity you 've got more room away from the fences on both sides to try and nail this drainage properly and [Music] actually grab it into the table drains and probably seal the road right into the table grains and everything you know if it was a road that was needed if there was an accident out here on the uh duck malloy road you you know you can easily get traffic control down the bottom and up the top and have traffic going either way for 10 minutes if you think the road 's a bit [Music] thank you what are our responsibilities what 's council 's responsibilities regarding australian standards if we do work on a road whether it 's a new road [Music] but it 's just a matter of parameters around new must because we have a number of roads that aren 't built to an australian standard now um i think councillor gibbons ray these some regional roads that don 't make the australian standard so it 'll be at the discretion of council to to make that determination thank you the council 's i 'm going to put this amendment then the council reduced the richard union to a road to a six meters seal width to allow additional ceiling to be created along the road to the value of three hundred and sixteen thousand five hundred twenty dollars all in favor of the amendment the amendment amendment is carried unanimously and the amendment now becomes the nation excuse me all in favor promotion thank you councillors [Music] number two the council provide one hundred and eighty thousand dollars towards the upgrade of the amenities of the overall swimming pool council mckinnon thank you speaking madam we did discuss this at the previous meeting number 13 item 1301 some detail um my view is that we should stick to the decision we made last time which was 've seen the new costings that have been proposed by the y um but that includes major work on the roof line etc i 'm assuming 180 000 which we had it costing for a previous meeting correct and the title 1301 um is still a viable proposal and that is what i think we should agree to castle [Music] [Music] the council provide 180 000 towards the upgrade of the amenities of the overall swimming pool all in favour married unanimously thank you number three council provide direction as to the residual of the thirty five thousand three hundred ninety four dollars to the above two projects and i have a movement place that 's the colony [Music] there is [Music] um [Music] through the chair given that giving the costing i think it was discussed that it should be a project that we consider doing without the need for grant funding and look at and look at other opportunities to use this month correct me if i 'm wrong i think we had several options emanating from the last meeting we were looking at reckoning whether it was were looking at black springs and was it the acoustics and we did have a memo from um council dhoni where they follow up here i can 't remember whether there were any other proposals for this well you can go with the recommendation but it be applied to one or other [Music] once you 've considered it one and two we 're going to have a residual 35 000 395 so that 's residual to the above two projects so we 're going to make a decision as to what we 're going to spend it can go through that is not how i understood through through the chair there were a number of projects that were being used around in february um ones sat way over the requirements of what was left as the residual some sat way under the perimeters and some also sit within current programs that we 're looking to try and achieve in this instance the report indicates that well given that you have two known projects that you could add value to i.e increase the the the um amount of soil that you the pools the way that the the um the intention of the report was to add it to one of those two projects however as was stated previously this is at the discretion of cancer cycle council want to provide another project where that money can be provided to it is at your discretion to do so the report recommendation says from my perspective add 35 000 to these two projects because they were the two that you identified as your as your go-to project and there were other funding and processes in place for the ones that we discussed however it 's up to council to make that decision [Music] acoustics in the hall of face springs and at the moving in discussion we 've already agreed from a black springs community meeting that we would fund some towards it because it was getting about to the amount that we needed to put acoustics in the hall and we were prepared to contribute that you 've got that email i hope it was to go and it was at the moment approved so that 's where i 'd like the black springs acoustics the scotia revenue pathways can something you remind us as to what the costumes were for each of those three projects um through the chair the iconic footpath was about five thousand dollars right the black springs acoustics is in the vicinity of 65 000. from the people we spoken to before so they 're thinking of the hooting and the solar panels we put in a grant for that and the scotia avenue footpath is going to be a varied solution given the variation of the footpath in that in that street however it 's something that our director of technical services is working on now through the town improvement fund where scotia avenue was one of those priority footpath areas that we 've discussed yes so on the acoustics is the black springs community association prepared to put in distances that 's what it should take i think if it 's fifty thousand forty four somewhere because we also applied for grants so is the black springs community association competitive nine thousand well they might be they certainly put in was a six and community association through you want to met or we have disparity through the chair a letter has been provided to council indicating that they would provide six thousand dollars to the to the acoustics that 's still not enough that is correct council cable the best way to spend it could be to do a little bit more on the new road because the features that we 've seen and and the reports that we 've had about the new seal road and been down there for a drive uh just confirmed all of that the more we can do on that road to local traffic law all of the time i think is the best way to spend the money thank you council um the pavement on earnings hill road council 's resolve to extend moon and hillary there is no saving in terms of the money spent the the benefit will be additional [Music] so or what specific project we 're looking at for thirty five thousand dollars three hundred and ninety four three three four thousand dollars what what what what component of the swimming pool would a go to value-add the the current proposal whilst trying to lead towards the revised proposal from my consent from my perspective it gives council an opportunity to potentially go to the y and say well we want to put this in if you want this are you going to come on board with funding if it doesn 't it would need to be a revised scope better to what better than what we had previously and less to what was provided here i know that doesn 't really answer your question counsellor but but what it it goes a long way to get what what 's being proposed supply and direct roof structure machine is that right well it 's thirty four thousand five hundred and fifty but there 's through the through the chair i wouldn 't like that i wouldn 't make that assumption so i would have thought if sorry you met a man i would have thought if you 're going to do something further from the pool um you 'd need another hundred thousand 116 000 so i 'm just not sure that this 's that 's fact it would not get to the funding which has been provided right now but what it will do is get you a value add to what you have originally approved which was a upgrading a retrofit of the existing facility so but what what i 'm trying to understand is what does that value add equate to i mean there 's nothing in this costing through without without being held to ransom i would suspect that what it would do is change the orientation of of the toilet facilities it would get it in a in a space whereas if money was to be made available potentially the roof could be changed at a later date so there 's some there could be some benefits equally there could be benefits from other projects so what we have calcium what we have here is a recommendation that council provide direction as to the residual 35 394 to the above two projects i 'd need an amendment and some direction as to what [Music] consider putting them back in the grandstand over the recreation that we can 't support council mckechnie 's footpath but i 'll understand in previous times when we get towards the financial year into the financial year the rms summaries rings up and say have you got some footpaths that need doing which is our windy one down there the common and you 've got to have them things shovel ready to go so if we knew that we were shoved already up there i 'd like to see that we spent the money if that will cover the put in the back in the grandstand that we can 't use because if you 've been over there when it rains you get washed away so you you can 't sit in the thing we need to complete that project and i think this money could go to that because jerry 's not going to put up the acoustics as a motion if i 'd like to put up that you spend the money and put the reason why that project hasn 't been earmarked in this fund is because we 're currently looking at grant funding to support that moving forward so similarly 's because we 're trying to seek other funding avenues for those [Music] to recommendation three the council utilized the residual 35 394 dollars for adding to the works on merman field linens hill road under recommendations one above or for undertaking additional works i have a second one [Music] can you comment on the [Music] and the third recommendation is that the residual will be added to the above two projects that 's the amendment my question is we have passed the first motion which was 316 000. and we dealt with that we dealt with that issue this this amendment is not in complete conflict with it but [Music] want a lot of money environmental reasons because some of the banks two and a half meet the street legislation to go that far up the road i don 't know how far the demanded amount of money is going to go but once you start to rise up you 're going to go in i think you 're going to have to start putting um cement barricades up to stop the erosion so you might get any extra and all that all the plane of that the erosion back anyway okay the other comics muscles i 'm going to put the amendment that council utilize the residual thirty five thousand three hundred ninety four dollars adding to receiving works on newman 's hill road all in favour one two three three in paper against one two three four six this amendment is defeated we now go back to our original motion all right we spend the money on the um [Music] how many one um foreign is that is that you amendment councilman i had a second house yeah and any discussion one doesn 't count application is um a dollar for dollar application through i think it 's a uh bushfire fund and it was we have just below thirty thousand dollars so we we sought a dollar for dollar contribution to to complete the project so that 'd make it a 60 000 project okay so this is the 61 000 yes so we 're still gonna have five thousand dollars if we get the graph through the chair if we get the grant then there i would suspect if you were to put this money towards that program but if you put the money towards that project and the grant doesn 't get up you haven 't got enough money that 's exactly what i 'm saying do we have a any threats in trying for um [Music] so it 's through the chair we 're looking at opportunities in that space we 're looking for opportunities in that space moving forward [Music] can i just have a flower concussion about the unused area at the back of the fitness center isn 't it already occupied with maps and they are using the space or the occupied computers have their research grant application in councillors please there is a brand application in to i think it 's to cover it from memphis yep to talk to in closer what i 'm saying is we 're looking at the western wall of the existing over recreation ground is there any other comment on this amendment yes you can okay we have a facility over there on the wreckage you can 't use you can sit in it back in so we can use the thing the other day there 's a shower or rain come down the people that were over there utilizing the site couldn 't even shelter from the rain because the rain just come in and come down the steps so i i 'd like to support this it 's one project we can get out of the road i support the project of the footpath i 'd like to say in the past the rms have run us up close to the end of finance with you and said can you do footpath so with this shovel already with these footballs and they 've got some money that they 've let 's channel that let 's use this money and fit in the back in the comments so can we utilise [Music] rugby league a lot of children are involved with bloody cows sitting up there watching soccer without a back in [Music] [Music] and just reiterate that this is not enough to complete that project if we do not get the grant funding where does the rest of the money comes is 30 000 that council has already provided to this project from ti ti supported the grant application for the 50 to create a 60 000 project should this get endorsed the grant will still roll along and if it was successful we would use that money that you 've just allocated and the town improvement would then get a unallocated fund attached to it where council then need to make a decision on what they want to do in that money okay but yes there would be enough money to do the project okay any other comments on this amendment councillors i 'm putting the amendment that council utilize the residual 35 394 for imposing the western war on the existing over on recreation ground grandstand all in favour one two three four five six the most amendment 's buried remember it becomes the motion all in favor how 's the line do you want your name your name will be mentioned emotions thank you number four nominations to the lrci program by the 31st of march 2001 to ensure physical completion and project acquittal by december 2021 a on

land being described as lot to dt868216 as the location for a dog off leash area i suggest that we could i suggest that we add locality to that that council adopt the amphitheater locality is there somebody to move that or is that [Music] we 'll just have that as a second recommendation yes can we move the motion first or is it about the so take out locality and put in adjacent [Laughter] [Music] there 's been considerable amount of reports and uh inquiry and a number of locations suggested over the years about the last three years as to where this off leash dog area should be and it appears that we 've finally come to an area that might be suitable and so i would have great pleasure in proposing this recommendation and that we before yes whilst madonna has movement of the motion before do i have a second one [Music] i 'm putting the recommendation in two parts all in favor okay [Music] don 't response risk management counselor 's place the recommendation is that council adopt policy 4-1-0 road response risk management as presented can i have a murder please counselor can i have a second one because the patient thank you thank you man this is a detailed policy and considerable improvement i think on this previous policy i 've read it tonight quite uh with the response codes the ratings the hazard risk scores um it will actually makes sense when you look at it and i think it 's a it 's a good document it obviously the best is for our categorization of roads the response times for correcting issues and all those sorts of things so i would commend the policy um to the council thank you thank you likewise page 100 item 1401 reports for information monthly activity report general manager the recommendation is that report item is received as information 's going to happen that you pennsylvania the current workload uh [Music] where people can [Music] the detailed analysis that council endorsed previously goes into providing a multi-use space not just mountain biking but still enabling those sort of facilities okay thank you very much 5 8 the way down the page of the overall fitness facility is that uh through the chair it 's with the wise leader of the tables um i keep on ringing and asking at this point in time they believe that it 'll be done this week thank you very much i think that 's all it 's pleasing to see halfway three that a lot of our recruitment positions have been built um in march in february march and that we have some new people also starting including a chief financial officer in april and uh [Music] is [Music] through the chair the issue when you 've got such a huge construction program is that sometimes our staff gets pushed and pulled in different directions you 're correct um we attempted to undertake a recruitment or a casual recruitment program in that space we 've we 've had um uh so we 're still looking to fill those positions yes you 're right so we 've uh recruited a couple of casuals but we 're looking for our auditions monthly activity report planning and development recommendation views that report item is received as information from another google place look for danny thank you the second approach has no kidding thank you danny apologize we 've got a number of things contributing to the [Music] [Music] problem [Music] um rather than maybe it 's got too much heritage you um to the director is it true that we 're nearly after six to eight weeks turn around for three hours um in respect that one i knew of the town planner went down and have a look and this is what i can 't understand when you 'd like to do it i haven 't lost a view the town planner went down and had a look at the site next thing you know the film inspectors down have a look at the site which takes time and these both people thought on camera like i just can 't to go to the so i understand that dylan need to go there because there was a change in the boundary but once his report says it 's okay i can 't understand why we need to have the time to for the bill inspector and then go there but there 's no building a place there and i 'm told that there 's six to eight weeks before you can get a va through it well that is correct um due to the uh staffing resource situation now that we 've got the new senior planner on board um hopefully we 've got to reduce the time again in regards to the uh the joinings for the inspections both by the planner and the inspector if it 's a joint application or a combined application for the da and a construction system that 's why we need uh that 's why we do both inspections you know i i just can 't understand when someone lodges the plan and it 's been approved by a planning person until some construction takes place i couldn 't understand why the other thank you thank you all the comments counselors the recommendation thank you 2012 three monthly activity report technical services the recommendation is that reporters receive this information moving thank you a second to customers i 'm thinking about the mayor of detail report and um work on campus rivera is um at the moment very quickly and it looks as though the base that 's been compared to that road excellent option and so obviously the shoulders are a lot wider than they were previously um my colleague next to me but uh it does look as though the good job is being done so and it 's being done uh fairly quickly i 'd imagine we 're probably ahead of schedule are we uh at this stage we are traveling quite comfortably um however looming into winter is our main concern that we 've had um if i could go to merits i would like to ask because i know it 's the two bridges that we 're replacing on ball bridge road and sewells creek road is um when is that working to be undertaken and are we this year right october through december you 've got to make sure that you take the turns quite quickly i mean not quickly you go slowly you 've got a sharp right sharp leg whichever way yes so we are changing your line but that 's appreciated and will they be much wider uh yeah certainly not cater for a dual lane uh carriageway um one weight limit uh anticipated to be a t44 the lt44 which is up to about 68 ton i believe so it 's quite substantial in terms of these um that that will move i believe yes even though the surroundings um and so um just on baldrige road i think we have discussed this before but it 's a road that continually requires maintenance because of the serrations that continue to appear in that road i know it 's a nightmare i think ultimately but uh good gravel is probably paramount in the initial stages as aside from their goes progress with looking at progressive ceilings on the road to reduce the need of thank you so much for the amount of work that i 've ever seen it happen like this before and they 're fairly well on top of it and it 's going great um after the bold ridges road i think it 's being an old road again it 's it needs four culverts and whether we can do that through the maintenance program i 'm not sure because breaking up with the waterfall even though i know [Music] uh [Music] material that sits in there so therefore you can 't get the water off the road build a cable table [Music] sections it 's uh to separate the high erosion so i think in pulling the drains out which router operators are expected to do again it 's very hard to i suppose stop the concentration of water to try and prevent that but i think again it 's probably one of those sections that may ultimately in the future again look at the council near the meadows and you can see where the grated river 's got nowhere he 's just pushed the material in and the thing 's already full so he 's got nowhere to put after we 've done the grading or something taken away the water 's just lying in the table right in the he 's done the best he can he can 't he 's got a machine that 's 20 foot long he can 't find that out better than what he 's done they 've done a fine job but as you can see they 're all full on the left hand side the water can 't [Music] and the other one was um recently uh completed hazel road or the meadows road um back on the over and in it 's starting to show where the water starts to cool on the road so that the road must be dishing out with the weight so it 's happening both sides and it 's it 's back within stockyards and then it 's starting to all the road must be needed the same is what happens is our list for inspection at the end of the week um [Music] an impressive operation however coming back up there on friday um in the rain it 's obvious that there are still _''_7800.56 water and i don 't think that that is optional in a newly new sealed road [Music] um [Music] [Music] 1304 monthly activity report corporate services recommendations use of the report item is received as information cannot have a mobile phrase council paper and cancelling the kittens um [Music] about [Music] directions guiding the town of urban front seem to have interpretations over time politically outside our school we just might appreciate some clarification [Music] [Music] and through the chair the guidelines have been previously provided in the public forum any other comments you come from the recommendation page 122 1405 statement of investments the recommendation is that council received report item 1405 as information can i have a leader please counselors counselor callum counselor don 't you mr kill him um [Music] um 125 councillors 1406 grants monthly update the recommendation is report item 14060 um reading through this um in particular on the page 128 near colorado stage 1 grant request i was a little bit confused here um [Music] we 've already secured partial funding of the 349 579 is that correct we have funding at 349 so in relation to the plan presented today we haven 't got a costing on this obviously and we 're having our landscape a little bit we we 've got 349 we 're looking for another 349. that 's how i understand it that 's correct um so we have presumed that that let 's say 700 000 because it 's close to it we 'll go how far to completing this we don 't know so how we 've how have we estimated well how have we made the grant application without actually incorporating the costing of if this is adopted of this plan that 's that 's my question i was so i couldn 't quite say yet so through the chair um if council can remember back to round three of the stronger country communities fund council lodged an application with that group to do stage one which was approximately a 600 000 project as part of the 350 that we got we had to reduce the scope of the current of that of that project the ability to then reuse that information that we 've had to the level that we are i understand that and that is the creation of a stage one cricket ground um drainage um landscaping irrigation it doesn 't complete let 's call it the proposal from that you 've seen today anything above let 's say the um [Music] uh the car park i was going with the empty thing with the car parks so anything from there on would need to be subject to further further okay so what i 'm asking is are we sat are we satisfied the current money we 've got under the drought communities ground plus what we 're now applying for would be able to do the ground as anticipated in this proposal through the chair no because you haven 't you haven 't endorsed yesterday that 's right so we 've costed a hypothetical ground yes we came up with yep not an actual grounding okay so we there still could be a mismatch this could cost more than what we 've actually applied for through it through the chair it would cost a substantial much more than what you have which saying well we understand this would be a stage project over a number of years the first stage which is the non-negotiables from my perspective would be that resolution from council that says this is our stage one and that 's where we 've looked to get the dollar for dollar funding through the through the bushfire fund to get that started so through you madame are we are we actually looking at putting and i know council has endorsed this but at some stage we 're going to be at need to do a costing of let 's say from the car park to the accommodate to actually know how that fits with what we what we have and what we 've requested so it 's through so and it may not be i i would have thought that that costing needs to be done sooner than later so that we actually know what the cost of this proposal is and how it meshes with what we have and what we 've requested and know what the delta is if there 's a delta i 'm not suggesting anything from the car down not including the car yet well i just think that 's an exercise that needs to be done no today even even before this comes to council to endorse it because we need to know what the delta is and what the options are what will come to council for endorsement will be planned from the architect integrating all sorts of things all sorts of things and that so when would my question i suppose is when would we be likely to be in a position to use that plan and that cost in particular um so through the chair the our landscape architect has been engaged that person has gone away and is looking at the site she 's been on site we 've had a number of discussions already a brief 's been prepared she will bring back similar to how we undertook the master plan at the common however this is on a much smaller scale than what the [Music] bus plan at the common would be i would suspect that in the next month we 'll be in a position to be um opportunities for the community to comment my only concern is that we don 't want to take twice we don 't want to pay for a consultant to do exactly what has already been done by the o 'connell community group um in that i realize our landscape guard the person may go into more detail but this is obviously had a regular likelihood to do it so i 'm just wondering how we get value for money from our landscape architect without doing duplication work through the chair i think it 's been acknowledged by both the person who put that plan together that it absolutely needs the expertise of a landscape architect to come up with a final design it 's been acknowledged that this is a good starting point however there 's a number of things that need to be undertaken and one of those is further consultation from council to the whole of the community and i 'm not suggesting that the whole the community couldn 't comment on the the proposal but there are others that we need to consult in this space so we possibly can so at what stage do we get a quantity surveyor or something to actually to do through the chair and take and through the chair and taking your point into consideration it will be imperative for council to understand where our stage is yeah i understand you 'll be right onto it but i just wanted to make sure we have to get a costing at some stage to know if we get the second grand what does that give us what 's that get us what is the short form if there 's a short form um so that we we we have that to play with as well as this i mean i think this is a fantastic concept but we also have to pay for it i mean if we do it for stages i 'm i 'm happy with that but you know we just we 've applied for money but we actually don 't know if that money is how much of it 's going to be covered if that wouldn 't what will the 349 thousand give us on this one think there 's maybe the opportunity for local people as well as the council to continue to use some of those age systems i 'm just wondering what 's rather than piling this stuff is it practical to consider bringing those centers that are potentially reusable back into the council compound i don 't have any [Music] [Music] declare a declaration of interest because i might put a tenure into [Music] [Music] because it sits over there and then watch your site right away it 's unusual this stuff would be all right and i understand that underneath it is um uh [Music] enjoyable um and you know there could be opportunities for use of those timbers to build 131 1407 water and silicon report recommendation is that item uh 1307 news procedures information help from the given second applies now together thank you itself i 'm just wondering if there 's any update on the damn level 32.2 i would have hoped over the weekend and the last few days it might have been slightly [Music] the water 's been flowing down the canvas 32.8 councillor it 's gone march [Music] [Music] 1408 councillors one patreon the recommendation is that the report item is received as information cannot please have a mover council table and a second but please i 've just asked the general manager of page 138 to take the application for the jrpp for the sports complex i know the the grant funding under the bushfires was launched then okay an application yeah it was the end of february as indicated councillors i think it was the 27th but what i 've said is have we got any update on the page 140 on the fluoride plant and if it 's going to be operational by march early april is that being operated by bathurst staff or by our own trade staff so through the chair there 'll be a number of options available to council and we 'll be looking at utilising those options and that will include both those things you 've talked about so are our staff currently being trained through the chair our staff are being trained yes so okay so how long do you visit the training uh couldn 't you so if our people need to train early april and they should be getting on the job pretty quickly so you through the chair so as soon as they become certified which is part of the course um requirement uh it will be an efficient orientation between regional council two council staff each council staff will [Music] uh yes we 'll guess a couple of weeks without freedom of council uh in that in that place uh and then we can get into cancer cycle so noting easter 's early april we 're probably looking at second or third regulations falls on the last weekend in march that 's right and the first weekend and the first order that 's why yeah it 's also one of the action audiences what it does okay that 's all i have thinking about it [Music] the other comments on [Music] as reported at the uh last black springs community meeting the plan director of planning and ir scheduling and inspection at this point in time [Music] we actually could see where the water was coming up off the top roof hitting against running into that moving room so it 's water damage this caused that damage to the floor he took some photos of it and also in the supper rooms the same thing must happen so the gathering 's uh really easy it looks like it seems like a smash trap or something that 's broken there and there 's a particular place in the garden where the water is coming down [Music] this one uh [Music] um just away um just a qualification due to the load on the um from the cleaning of wiring and sort of sufficient budget there will be two clear flags [Music] [Music] to [Music] thank the recommendation is report item 1409 is received as information can i have someone to move that place mr cable thank you guys thank you received this uh the report on what 's going on thus far um is to see the somewhere in there i think it mentions that um the uh mulching of all that big pile of green waste that was out there i suspected and and i didn 't see the mulched up stuff and an idea we started around thank you area was going i think some of the points of liberty [Music] just through the chair it 's noted that another report will need to be furnished with council at this point in time going into depth with the thing it 's at no point want to gloss over the requirements of the notice of motion however at the time it 's just trying to give the information back to council on where we are today and leading towards where we 're going to head into the future um thank you very much i 'm pleased to see the bottom two reps of page 151 what 's been done to address some of the issues um and i note the second paragraph and the comment halfway down uh i 'm on page 152 um the third the second full paragraph or it starts with currently the completion the office so as i understand it currently we have no allocated funding uh completion of the office in wc facilities or for the movement of the pound out there 's no allocated funding available through lodged a grant to the life of the ground to try and facilitate its complete movement rather than utilize waste funds to do it and i know that we 're due to know the second half of 2021 as to whether our grant 's been successful if it hasn 't been successful we 'll then have to come up with some funding to at least move the pound because especially the sdp goes so through the chair the funds in the waste fund would be utilized to complete that work if that was the case that 's as i understand i can 't remember what the waste current waste and reserves are but i was a bit confused with that paragraph the end of that paragraph which is the one that begins currently completion in the office in the last few lines which this process has been overtaken attempt to limit the need to utilize current waste fund reserves and then the final paragraph on 152 there are currently no unrestricted funds within the waste fund any reserve needs to be spent so what sorry there 's three words that to be spent within the waste fund yes why because the waste fund is a special fund that you collect money for for that distinct purpose yes i understand but so there are no unrespected funds and that is because the waste fund is the waste fund yeah so they 're yeah so they 're all restricted so there is no unrestricted fund within the waste fund so which is why it can 't be but facilities what i 'm saying is it can 't_''_9687.04 be used to bitumen soil roads i understand it but can it be used for the wc can it be used for installation of the donkey we would look at those things as long as there was the link to the waste fund so in this instance because it 's the dual the dual purpose gives us that opportunity um but otherwise those waste fund reserve may need to be used elsewhere correct um okay but i i was just i thought the last sentence was a little confusing because there are that 's absolutely correct with waste facility waste facilities or something like that the reason why it said the current unrestricted funds that exist in the waste fund is part of the notice of motion we just wanted to confirm that there are no unrestricted funds within the wastewater they 've been restricted to what funds exist within the waste fund that could be utilized for um other things within the wasteland and i think that what councillors will be aware of is that another report will be brought back and that information will be provided well i think we just need to clarify that 's probably what paul 's saying rather than what it says as it was presented it 's a part of the operation because i understand that if you 're not out there early enough to get the solar panel going you don 't have the power to use the machines that are out there apparently and there 's conflict between the staff and thank you so isn 't it a part that should be utilized straight away and put the damn thing out there like if you give it a moment we call for the report and this got the proper power source out there we we 're not achieving we 've got the staffing content from out there back in the elements so it 's the way so through the chair the second last paragraph dictates yes we know that we 're looking at solar but there 's other opportunities and maybe we should investigate those for long-term benefits rather than short-term months that 's what the that 's what the paragraph states i haven 't_''_9872.8 said that looked at the power on it years ago when the room was a thing and i don 't think the report can get back again today there was three options given by the provider yep there was a number so we have an income source we didn 't last financially you would get 45 40 000 in recycled uh uh alone recycled matter so isn 't that absolutely and we should have money in the fund because we have more than we have let 's say point away all the time there is absolutely money in the fund what i will do is bring back a report to cancel 's going to cost council one to close the old cell two to open the new cell and three to get the facility to a level that meets all the requirements of its license so that 's what i want to do rather than saying well we can rob peter to pay for it and we also need a report that we have green stuff going there that was tipped for free it costs later engages in 80 000 an hour or something and they sat there with an excavator in the machine but he 's putting dirt through that machine that dirt shouldn 't be in that green part and we 're charging them nothing to dump all that there through through the chair the issues we 've got with green waste are many um the major one is is that people seem to put all the stuff underneath the green waste put the green lace on top so i 've got green waste and empty it all into the pile when it comes to going through that mulcher there 's issues with that which adds cost but yes we provide that we that we continue to offer our community and until council make a decision to do something else that 's what we 'll continue to do the cost of the supervisor camera it could be there back into the heart wouldn 't cost much brief it 's reward pretty quick [Music] own back to council we 're hoping may because the the project with our consultant will take between four to six weeks so all right so can we know today we 're trying for may that 's when when we do the um issue before then we 'll go into this report if we could hope even if we could hopefully may or she a camera or something for these people who don 't abide by the green waste thing is serious i know that there have been fines imposed by some council on people who do as you say they cover the cover their other rubbish with green waste you 've only got to find a few people and the work gets round so i know we don 't have probably enough staff out there because you 're only going to find a couple in the world that 's right i 'm assuming this will come back to your review well recommendations page 153 there is no urgent business this evening item 16 procession confidential reports there are no post session or confidential reports this evening i 'm 17 i 'll now prepare the meeting closed at 8 19. the next ordinary council meeting on council will be held on tuesday the 20th of april 2021 commencing at 5 30. thank you counselors _"

was john f kennedy jr on the effects of 5g wi-fi damage on children i strongly urge the council to be aware of the issues concerning 5g so that if and when 5g is brought to the council 's attention by telstra or other telco company you are aware that people not only myself are concerned about the implications of 5g on the 3rd of june i emailed a letter to council regarding the concerns i had regarding 5g and the health outcomes for prominent people who have great knowledge regarding this matter my question is why did you not report this email meeting and i 'm happy to respond to that mr acting mayor and that is we 've had a look at those minutes and it and that correspondence was inadvertently uh omitted from the from the mayor 's incoming correspondence it 's been updated through this this meeting the information that was provided was generic sorry was information sent to all councillors regarding 5g and was provided to councillors at the time the information could be replied to ms wiseman at any time by any counsellor so that was the information that was omitted thank you general manager uh item made on page seven confirmation minutes we have two sets of minutes one is for the ordinary meeting in august and one is the works committee committee meeting held last week um the recommendation is that the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on the 18th of august 2020 be confirmed can i have a mover and account council mckibben and councillor mckinney i have you counseling given unmute sorry um yes i i would recommend that the minutes be approved subject to chew changes item 3.05 which was the until an inspection or a viewing had been held that should have been a unanimous decision i did not vote against it item three point eleven um that was noted as unanimous and that was in relation to the material for use on the recreation ground at o 'connell i believe that wasn 't unanimous i believe uh councillors capel mccarthy and mckechnie voted against that that is correct okay so subject to those changes being made i recommend that those minutes be approved um okay does there anyone has any problem with those amendments noting that uh there seems to be agreement that was the actual fact council mckinney um i think the executive secretary has checked the recordings sorry sorry go ahead councillor mckibben go ahead car sorry i think the executive secretary has checked the recordings and confirmed that my recollection was correct okay okay councillor mckinney if you 've got anything you wish to say uh no i was just going to say that i voted against the um the material that for the uh fence of our column but councilman kevin 's um already covered i as a mover and second are happy with the amendments that have been proposed for the um uh minutes yes okay then um i 'll put that to a vote uh all in favor against unanimous all right uh moving on to the worst committee meeting for the 8th of september 2020 uh recommendations of the minister of the works committee meeting held on the 8th september 2020 be confirmed i have a mover in a second to please it 's not that difficult come on councillor cable and council dhoni councillor

can i have a mover in a second to please counselor mckibben and councillor mccarthy councilman mckibben uh thank you distracting mayor thank you distracting mayor um could i ask and i think it was a meeting you 're present at the meeting with the honourable paul toole on the 4th of september about i 'd say 5 8 of the way down page 8 regarding the sewer treatment plan and a proper and a possible um uh extension of the period for completion of this project and possible funding sources i 'm assuming but that that was the discussion but and what was the result of that that discussion was was quite useful um we are in the process now of making some um administrative changes to will take a little while i think that the general managers is having is going to call a meeting of the working group sometime in the next week or so so the working party can discuss exactly what happened and what our way ahead is general manager can you add anything to that um through through the chair now i think you 've covered it uh mr acting mayor it was very useful and it 'd give our local member an opportunity to get an understanding of where we 're up to in the process any other questions councilman kevin uh yes i could in relation to correspondence uh mr actually mayor um the have we had any um feedback from on from the 20th of august correspondence was that further feedback from the director of greater sydney recovery alison morgan through any assistance for oberon from resilience new south wales i just noticed that there 's been a number of meetings and quite a bit of correspondence over the last couple of months so i was just wondering if there are any outcomes uh general manager you 're probably you mr chair yeah um resilience new south wales is very keen to support oberon council with their business reactivation initiatives and those meetings were in order to provide an update on where that up to um resilience of taking a very active approach from um our initial correspondent sentiment back after the fires and they 're keen to try and be involved in oberon 's bushfire recovery so i 'm more than happy to provide you with a copy of that correspondence you require no i i 'm happy with with that response mr mayor halfway down page 10 i note there was a meeting with marge armstrong regarding 2020-21 rates um was that in relation to the level of rates or what was that in relation to sorry what date was that uh councilman kevin uh sorry that was um third of september i 'd say two thirds of the way down page ten i don 't mind if you have to refer this back to um yeah um i will if that 's not a problem yeah uh general manager you have anything you can add to fed is the second item from the bottom on the page 10 from brad hargens in relation to the future development of alcohol recreation ground uh was that positive or negative or um constructive um you 're aware of this uh again if you have to refer that i 'm sure that 's fine okay i 'll get back to you councilman kevin through the chair both those meetings were held with the mayor and they have need to be taken on notice all right uh any thank you um i um i reckon i recommend that the mayoral minute uh thank you councillor mccarthy the report just shows how much is involved in what the mayor does the only thing my concern is that looks like the local ratepayers have gone off to paul toole about the miranda dogs out at poor 's retreat which looks like we can 't get on top of it so um looks like the people have gone off to our local member to try and get some action which is anyway i just thought we would have been able handled in-house anyway no put the recommendation all in favor sorry my apologies councillor gibbons uh yeah just correspondence on page nine uh and again on uh the next page where paula boom has made enquiries about the balfour pit and the management of it and i 'll see there 's been two responses is that in regards to a management plan soon we 're coming into the spring and summer again that 's our responsibility uh i 've been advised previously that this is about the vegetation management plan for that particular uh parcel of land yes right i just had a couple of calls and i didn 't know where it was up to and uh and yeah that 's the way to go a management plan thank you any more questions or comments nope okay i 'll put the recommendation all in favor against it 's unanimous okay notices of motion page 11 item 1001 recession rescission motion merrill minute althea johnson we the under the recision motion is that we the undersigned counselors give notice that the resolution of the ordinary council meeting held on the 18th of august 2020 which reads that the council over on council called six new units in the curtis street complex the leith johnson units and the council recognized the contribution of murph and dwyer and named the remaining four units the merv and dwyer units and that was carrick with um only only voted against it was uh mere statutes the motion is that that motion be rescinded and request that the matter be reconsidered at council 's ordinary meeting to be held on the 15th september 2020 and that 's signed council mccarthy councillor mckinney and council line uh a mover and a second to please councillor mccarthy councillor mckibben council mccarthy yes mr may um it was my fault i went down to the units and i couldn 't find the plaque on the um ones in curtis street all the other ones are on the end of the building and the other one for um the curtis street one is actually in the middle of the building and and it definitely shows that it 's the nurse box so i 'd like to move that we um recognize what the that way thank you councilman kevin uh thank you mr striking mayor uh yes i 've read this uh recision notice but more importantly i 've read the the latter item that deals with this um uh this item later in the business papers and agenda and on consideration of those of that together with this precision motion i would i would prepared to second this precision motion and uh support the three uh councillors who 've raised it okay um is it anyone else wishes to speak all right i pushed put the recision motion to the vote all in favor sorry sorry council danny councillor danny thank you uh mr acting mayor i 'll remember i think i must be on your peripheral vision tonight um uh i just two quick things i was um one of two who spoke against this when it first came up but not against it but for a deferral um and uh i just want to recognize that i don 't think there 's been any other motivations in this but to uh generously and um and justly recognize the effort of can be hard to do i need to find out about everybody i 'm very glad that this has now come this way and the latter motion clears it all up for us but i think we just do need to recognise the motivation uh was always the very best through all of this thank you councilman keeping nothing so any more anyone else wishes to speak all right i put the recipient motion to vote uh all in favor anyone against no that 's carried now i will now bring forward item 1301 uh on age 33 which is the naming of the curtis street units mr acting yeah um just a little bit of housekeeping and we 'd like to bring an item forward maybe you can get a mover and a seconder to bring that item forward i 'll have a move in a second to bring the item forward yes mccarthy and councilman counts mccarthy council mccarthy yes so i 'll move that we moved forward or or second it whatever you like all right councilman kevin you 're second um thank you mr mayor i relates to the same basic issue and as we 're sending one motion units it seems appropriate to deal with uh the linked one that actually deals with um probably reapplying uh the correct or what we some of us would see is the correct interpretation of what should happen with the naming of the unit so it is appropriate to deal with it now so i would gladly second that all right all in favor against all right carried um all right report for decision 1301 naming of the curtis street units the recommendation is that units five to eight of the curtis street unit complex be named the leith johnson units in recognition recognition of althea tamar johnson known as leith johnson and it 's nine and ten and be named the mervin dwyer units in recognition of merv and dwyer units one to four of the curtis street units remain named the nurse fox house do i have a mover in a second but please council mccarthy and council line councillor mccarthy yes um mr mayor um i i think what we 're trying to do is mrs johnson 's um plea was to have a aged care unit um and the money the way things demographic of the state government and federal government change we we don 't have any control into that and this is the best place for her her money that she provided and um also um councillor dwyer when he was on council and on the um board at the hospital he arranged to have significant money i think coming from the edith area with the sale of a um hall out there and and that money come back in the community back into the hospital so it 's good that we can recognize both these parties for this new news site anyway thank you very much uh council line your you need to unmute you are right uh thank you acting mayor um i just seconded what council mccarthy just repeated about um the service that mervyn dwyer has done for this community over the years thank you thank you council on council mckinney yes mr acting mayor uh just one comment on on the naming the recommendation uses the words i just would suggest that maybe we change it to elite johnson house in mervyn dwyer house to be consistent with the block that 's already named nurse fox house and and be consistent with the units in balfour street which uh also have the term house instead of units so councilman kenny are you proposing amendment yes okay can you bring that up on uh on shared screen please uh sharon through the chair if the mover and second are happy to change the word unit to house i don 't think we need to go too far uh mr chair like um okay i concur with uh councillor mckinney 's um commentary all the others are named houses and it 's it 's probably um a good recognition to keep consistency in this instance i am mindful of the uh coder meeting practice amendments that may be coming up later um council mccarthy you had your hand up a moment ago yeah i i was going to move that we just changed it to units so long as the second or was that be happy with that castle you just amend the recommendation please sharon bring it up so is that what you intended counselor mckinney yes okay with that sharon all right we 'll put the uh amended recommendation all in favor and passed unanimous right next item is item 1302 council committees there is a recommendation in four parts just through the chair sorry um missed acting there but we brought that bit forward so we need to go back of course thank you for catching my error all right next item is on page 12 item 1002 forestry corporation uh intended freight haulage route and this was the motion is that oberon council right to the new south wales state manager of forest new south wales seeking their intended routes to haul the pine pine plantation timber which is bound by the abercrombie mozart and murray 's lane that has no council road frontage and contact the local manager uh in contact with local manager has come back fruitless council needs this information for long term road planning of heavy impact roads there is no recommendation for this the general manager has placed some notes if he is would like to speak to those notes uh and then perhaps if there is a recommendation we can figure out what that is um through the chair this is a notice of motion from uh councillor mccarthy the notice of motion is that council seek to to forward additional correspondence back um the my general manager 's notes related to the response that council received back in 19 december 19 relating to the issue that was brought up previously so the notice of motion is for councillors to consider in its own merit based on the word on the information that 's provided okay do we have a mover and a seconder councilor mccarthy councillor doni councillor mccarthy um through you mr mayor um we need this information so we can plan ahead we we we 've requested this from a local um source and we can 't get a response council have approximately a hundred thousand dollars they 're going to spend on mozart road which might be fruitless if we don 't make the road strong enough to support log trucks in the future and i was approached in town by a lady that pointed out to us she 's sympathetic to the council if we can 't get a rescission a decision from the state forest she said she understands that cost of doing local roads is in the vicinity 130 000 per kilometer but when the impact of logging on the roads it adds another hundred thousand to the stronger pavement we need to find out where this timber is going to go out and not only the timber going out they 're going to have to build the road network in around this timber so there 's going to be have to be gravel and and road works done prior to the harvest so that 's going to impact on on the area somewhere too so that 's why i 've written this we need to find out and be in partnership with the state forest not this um we 'll we 'll tell you when we 're ready anyway thank you council donating thank you mr eckingbird um this request has gone in multiple times it 's quite reasonable it 's have the information that we need thank you council dhoni councillor mckibben um thank you mr acting man i 'm i 'm a little confused we have a general manager 's note that indicates there was a response um and i think the response was in response to our later the 17th of december 2019 or his response to a letter that followed that meeting um i 'm assuming that forestry gave us the local person gave us the best indication that they had the time as to what they would be doing i 'm not sure that writing again is going to get any better response even if it 's further up the chain i question whether we might be better writing a self-serving letter to forestry corporation saying thank you very much for your response david whatever and repeating what they have said and so we have asked we requested this information on the basis that we are upgrading mozart road and are not currently upgrading it to take forestry trucks or large haulage um should however you have to exercise your option five that you provided to the earliest notification possible and we would seek confirmation from forestry that they would contribute to upgrading that road prior to them using it for the use of um forestry haulage trucks is that a better way to go i don 't know i 'm just questioning because we have had a response it 's uh unclear response but it 's probably as good as we 're going to get because it does show what their options are um and until they actually get to the logging of it we may not get a better one the general manager might comment as well any other counselors wish to speak on this council gibbons yes we 've been pushing this one for a while i know there 's been verbal discussions with the forestry and the landowner which gives them a straight run in there they 're talking eight or ten years away i do know there 's gravel in the forestry there as well i know the forestry has used private property before when there have been shortcuts so i 'm a bit of a loss to know whether to gravel this as we plan to because there 's a lot of other ratepayers and land owners are using it there if they 're eight or ten years away it 's probably going to need another upgrade then gravel doesn 't last forever so we don 't seem to be able to get anywhere through the forestry so they may have to work it out when they get there and we 'd be putting the pressure on them thank you thank you councillor gibbons um uh uh councilman cuban i 'll give you one more yeah sorry sorry um acting may i miss vacuum i was actually seeking um some commentary from the general manager re the proposal i had as to whether because i 'm a shoot i i wasn 't sure whether the response you received that he commented on there was oral or writing and whether we should stand a self-serving letter back as to what his his view was uh it 's okay council of cuba and i was letting councils have a go first before i got back to the general manager sorry general manager have asked this question quite a number of times um i don 't think that there would be any um we 'd lose any friends if we gave an indication on how we were looking to upgrade this road and seek their interest in that in that way to try and work out if there 's any any activity going to occur there we can note that this is a this is a priority project for council and it 's been funded and if that then means that they need to come to the party and fund it at some other time now could be the opportunity to do that um however i do note the in the correspondence which was written it wasn 't verbal correspondence um it was indicating that look it 's eight to ten years away and we 'll we 'll cross that bridge when we get there because we don 't know if the same owners are going to be the same owners and and what will happen in the future is unknown but another letter indicating um a different spin on it maybe may write a reply um thank you just the uh in the report it says there that the um i think it 's in number two that it 's 30 years away that could change dramatically with the shortage of timber do you see timbers coming into over in the the present coming from walker and a long long haulage who has never perceived in the past the right that mr borg has some right to hold might mean that this forest might not get to its uh duration it might get thin prior to this 30-year date everything 's changed from the bushfires so that 's why i think it 's imperative that we send this letter off and try and get some resolution from the state forest so we can plan as a council plan these haulage roads thank you all right we 'll put the motion all in favor uh one two three four five so it 's mckechnie line gibbons stoney mccarthy and cable and mckibben and so unanimous happy okay next item is 1201 central table lands alliance audit and risk and improvement committee the recommendation a mover and a second please councillor mckibben and councillor cable um thank you mr acting mayor i my internet 's cutting out a little bit i think i was accepted as the proposal was i yes thank you um look it 's a detailed report i know the quite good work done in relation to a number of items in particular risk um and i also note um in particular the area that dealt with the oberon particularly um and um the questions raised of obron um i wasn 't um philip berget and i think the new auditors at john o 'malley uh from orange or from investors um and some of those are quite deep questions um and there were some questions in relation to the investment policy so i think it was quite a far-reaching audit from what i reckon read right through it um so well done to all those involved committee thank you

delegates to external recommendation organizations for the following year with a list of the organisations in the commentary and uh and who they who the representatives are i have a mover and a secondary uh councillor mckibben councillor cable councilman kevin thank you thank you thank you mr acting mayor yes um this is basically the same as the current situation um and obviously we all know the note at the end on page 43 the general managers um and should uh should we need to action any of these cash management committees um then i assume that the watching first people holding the watching brief will inform us um yes i 'd recommend uh i 'd recommend this proposal counselor cable thank you thank you mr acting mayor uh yes i 'm uh nothing to add councillor mckibben has covered it well um yes nothing further ahead thank you thank you councillor dhoni thank you mr acting mayor um the 43 the over on timber complex community consultative committee it sort of fell over for a while with changes of personnel i think out of borg originally and it moved to um a time in the day where i couldn 't go i 've yet to reconnect with it but i 'm i 'm happy to um to attempt to do that but i 'm not sure um in fact whether it was director of planning or one of the other councillors that was attending that meeting um and and not counsellor mckibben i 'd just want to recognize that if that was in fact the case um i 'm not sure i 've actually attended one of those meetings maybe two months ago and there wasn 't a lot of interest in the community in it i for a while too before that i don 't know whether council mckibben wants to stay there or whether we need to recognize some change council mckibben uh thank you um mr striking mayor i have attended uh one or two of these meetings um i think they went into suspension with uh covert 19 and i was unable to attend one uh due to some other circumstances i can 't remember what it was and i gave an apology through um executive secretary um look i 'm i 'm quite happy whatever council determines in this um yeah so is there i 'll ask a general question of counsellors is there anyone else who is willing uh or interested in being part of this consultative committee okay that answers that one uh in that case we 'll leave it with uh council mckibben and councillor dhoni at least as uh the delegates of record uh and we 've already proven that uh sometimes someone else will go if uh those two are unavailable so i 'll uh council mccarthy going on it 's open it 's community meeting isn no you 're absolutely right councillor mccarthy um um as an independent person absolutely uh these are just these are just the people we 've got down for council but if any other council wish to attend there 's no reason why they couldn 't all right i 'll put the recommendation all in favor against nil and next item item 1304 development application 10 20 20.5 1.1 construction of a shed patio cover and carport and removal of three existing sheds and carports the recommendation is that council very part c 5.5 building high plane and part c 6.4 carports and garages of its current dcp 2001 associated to an application 10 20 20 51.1 for construction of a shed patio cover and carport at lot 13 in dp 2364 section d being known as 10 springfield street oberon a division is to be called in accordance with section 375a of local government act 1993. do i have a move in a second council mccarthy and councillor gibbons council mccarthy i 'm happy with the report especially with the response on page 46 thank you thank you council gibbons and uh don 't have a problem with that support the recommendation anyone else wish to speak okay so i 'll put the put the motion all in favor against us unanimously all right the next item is 1305 on page 55 and this is the model policy 1102 model code of conduct the recommendation is that council endorse the draft model code of conduct policy 1102 and draft procedures for the administration of the model code of conduct as presented mover councillor mckibben seconda councillor dhoni council mckibben thank you mr uh thank you mr acting mayor um it 's look i 've read this through and um it makes sense however um i 'm assuming that we that our policy should now reflect the amendments on 50 pages 55 whilst the policy 1102 i don 't believe is marked up with the changes when i read it through relation gifts and benefits it seems that the existing um the the the code that existed up to fifty dollars for gifts etc and um um and also the removal of the captain relation to meals and expenses had not um an oversight or are we not accepting those changes proposed by the model code of conduct i 'm just questioning because i couldn 't read it into it when i read the attachment in the attachments it still retained what i thought was the old wording general manager yeah through the chair the council of cummins correct um ultimately we don 't receive too many applications for gifts and benefits now um but the 50 market didn 't seem to be a problem for us if councils of mine to up the limits for gifts to a hundred dollars they 're quite within their right to do so the reason why we left it as it was was simply because there is very limited numbers of gifts that have been applied for now and also the less the gift value the less the risk thank you general manager i 'm i 'm happy with that um i just thought this paper should have sort of indicated that we sort of stayed with the existing rather than taking up some of the amendments maybe it hasn 't maybe i didn why the the document is presented as it is is because we propose to keep it as it is if counsellors of mine to change it to the hundred dollars it 's simply a matter of changing the number within the code we 've just left it at 50 because the indication is council can rather than council must uh councillor dhoni mr acting mayor um if councilman kevin is concerned about the fifty dollars um i can only point him to um uh 6.8 where ties scarves coasters typings diaries chocolates or flowers are unlimited um if you know if you have some concern there mr acting mayor i feel that um [Music] this is a good document it 's always a very complex one for us mere mortals to have a full grip on and would also recommend that i know we only have a real 12 months left but if there is any requirement for us to continue to build our professional development um model code of conduct could be one such subject of a short course at a convenient time and length for councillors to help happy to to support this thank you council dhoni i i note your comment on on professional development i think that is a good idea anyone else wish to comment no i 'll put the motion those in favor unanimous all right next item is policy 1101 code of meeting practice on page 57. the recommendation is that council adopt the draft model code of meeting practice policy 1101 as presented do i have a mover and a second mover is uh councillor cable and secondary councillor mckibben councillor cable thank you mr mayor i would like to move the motion with um some changed wording if i may and is that does that change wording a minor change in the recommendation or in in the actual code of meeting practice in the code of meeting practice in the code of meeting practice the addition of two more points okay can you speak to those players uh this would have to mean i can um there 's a second a happy if i do that have you got a second yes yes all right i propose two additions to the is that the mover and seconder of emotion or an amendment may not speak against the motion or amendment second one is that the mover or seconder of a motion may not move or second an amendment to it but is entitled to speak upon any amendment and devote and favor council mckibben um i lost a little bit of that um in through the unstable internet connection i was wondering if the executive assistant would be able to place that up on the shed screen the proposed wording are you able to do that sharon good section 10 so counselor cable uh the first item would be in which particular section i 've got section ten it doesn 't really matter much you are asking me where it goes i 'm through through the chair if i may i would simply recommend if this is the way councils were looking to go it would need to be included at the end of section 10 with just some additions added to that to keep the code i 'm in line with that of the requirements of olg okay i think a formal amendment and take them separately because they 're quite different in their effect i agree all right if that mister mr acting mayor if that 's the case i can 't move the motion or i wouldn 't_:_3721.2 i don 't want the information okay is is there i can 't see the the uh councils at the moment except for a couple of them that 's better um so is there anyone willing to move the motion that those items be accepted as a as a amendment all right i think councillor cable was withdrawing his uh support his um movement he he might be able he can 't withdraw excuse his country mr councillor kevin just let happen why not i might be able to help you here the rules of debate state quite clearly that the mover and second of emotion may not move an amendment to it now that 's not exactly written into our rules of debate as yet but that 's where i would like written into the rules of debate they 've written into the rules of um debate in every reason i can 't move the motion if you want me to move an amendment well i 've asked other councillors is there another council willing to move that motion please clarify which motion you 're discussing this is this is item item one of the proposed amendment that uh that was up on the screen a few minutes ago well i i must say the councilor has put us in a difficult position if he wanted an amendment i recognize that and um if there 's no one if he 's not moving it and no one else is willing to move move it i will make the ruling that that motion now lapses or that proposed amendment now lapses that 's the givens a question so if i 've got it right we can 't move or second a motion for discussion anymore and to open it up we 've got to vote with that motion through the chair would you like some assistance in this instance it would probably help okay so it seems to me that what counselor cable has indicated that he does not want he wants a an amendment to that so going back to your original if you can get a mover and a seconder for the current recommendation you can move into rules of debate where councillor cable will then indicate that he 's proposing an amendment correct so you 're in effect withdrawing your original moving of the motion then castle cable yes okay well mr chairman if i am prepared to move the motion if i have a seconder as it sits on page 57 as a recommendation okay the the uh mover was uh was castle cable and then you seconded so you 're now moving the motion is there a seconder all right councillor mckibben thank you mr acting man um i think really we have we have to adopt the model code of meeting practice as it is presented um there are always we can make additional requirements if required but i think it 's pruned at this time that we do in accordance with the office of local government guide so i would move the recommendation as it currently sits on page 57 okay and counselor 's an amendment in the wind and should that should that amendment actually be put forward that would preclude me from speaking against the motion that i just sent him i 'm just trying to smooth the path for this so um i seconded the motion for the purposes of debate to give the uh anybody who should be interested the opportunity to now move an amendment thank you thank you councillor danny would anyone else like to come in at this point answer the cable i 'd like to move an amendment and that 's proper process counselor cable perhaps we should have gone there in the first place perhaps i 'm sorry sorry to do this to you mr acting mayor at your first meeting that 's okay counselor cable i 'm sure that what worse will be done so shall i um just please read out my proposed amendment um yeah i proposed two additions to the rules of debate in section 10 and i 'm happy as the general manager said for them to go at the end it doesn 't matter where they go as of a motion or an amendment may not speak against the motion or amendment and two the mover or second of emotion may not move or second an amendment to it but is entitled to speak upon any amendment and debate in favor of it or against it if he wants to okay so that that is an amendment that almost stands on its on itself because it 's an inclusion in the code of conduct a coded meeting practice um so we should be voting directly on that amendment correct general manager all right can you bring the amendment up a second oh sorry second up we have we haven 't got we have not a second for that amendment yet but if we got a second up well that might that might make it very easy might make it easier yes there is no secondary all right that amendment lapses we return to the with the original recommendation so i 'll put the recommendation that council adopt the draft model code of meeting practice policy 1101 as presented all in favour against unanimous all right moving on page provision facilities to councillors recommendation that the council endorsed policy 1103 payment of expenses and provisional facilities to councillors as presented do i have mover and councilman kibben seconder council mckenny uh thank you mr acting mayor um there 's no changes to these policy this policy from the existing situation and obviously because the election 's been deferred um we just need to endorse this for a further period of 12 months i would move the recommendation as um tabled on page 58 of the business papers thank you councillor mckevin council mckinney oh yes mr ackeemier i i [Music] support the recommendation it 's um there 's no change it 's just a status quo for another 12 months so i don 't see any issue with supporting the motion so i 'll put the recommendation all in favor against none all right the next item uh corporate services policies review item 1308 his recommendation three parts the council approved the following policies as presented in report 1308 part a collection developments 2402 and part b children and young people in the library 2403 and workplace security and mobile devices two one two four do i have a mover and a second to please councillor cable and council mckibben councillor cable thank you thank you mr acting mayor um no amendments this time uh yeah i 've read um read through the uh the marked up um documents and that 's all very straightforward and just updating to the place that we need to be now and um yeah i am i 'm happy to uh to move the recommendation thank you council cable uh councillor mckibben um thank you mr king man i thank council again for providing marked up versions that makes this easiest for us councils to review in relation to the third item which is the workplace security and monitoring um i 'm assuring this policy will only need to apply to those premises or those facilities etc that council has control over hence that 's why the swimming pool and fitness center for the swimming pool has been removed and fitness center has not been included because they will be under the control of whoever the relevant manager is in relation to i to um just before the notes section on page 59 that 'll obviously have to integrate into that workplace security and monitoring um when is it envisaged that that policy will have been developed um and obviously there are peculiar requirements in relation to cctv footage where it enters into the workplace domain so how we when we have that in place to ensure that it and this policy um are consistent and in compliance with the law little manager i 'm happy to divert to the uh corporate services director in this instance that 's right thank you um acting mayor i think was that uh we are currently in the process of developing a cc external cctv policy along with the regular regulatory guidelines and also the police force guidelines we are hoping to have that to cancel in the next couple of months and you 've got a follow-up question councilman kevin uh well well it 's just also that the question that i raised in relation to i 'm assuming this doesn 't apply to the swimming pool and fitness center because they are under the within our policy it has to fall within there is that correct yes that is correct right thank you um on that basis i i would move direct recommendations uh in report 313.8 a b and c which is the three policies uh be accepted by council thank you councilman kevin anyone else wish to speak to this in that case i 'll put the motion and uh all in favor unanimous all right uh item 1309 on page 60 on page 60 a request to widen a section of black bullock road there 's a recommendation that in two parts report item 39 1309 be received as information and council investigate potential grant funding opportunities that may permit further opportunity to expand the existing walking track due east along black bullock road uh do i have a mover and a seconder councillor mccarthy and councillor uh gibbons council mccarthy uh the report speaks to itself anything with a um the track the track deviates um from say north to south um it 's very hard to um actually get a alignment for a pacific walking track or a cycle a working progress thank you thank you for the report and council gibbons yeah through the chair uh it 's going to be a bit of a tough one this uh dense native trees either side and uh you know we 're only looking at it and may go ahead with it i think it 's a work in progress and it looks like a high cost and difficult one to achieve at this stage thank you council gibbons anyone else wish to speak to this i 'll put the motion then uh all in favor unanimous all right item 1310 on page 63. drought communities grant a connell road footpath and fence project the recommendation is the council proceed to construct the 200 metres of mortise post uh and three rail fence at equated cost of forty three thousand seven hundred fifty dollars along the frontage of the kong recreation ground and part two nominate the surplus funds of forty six thousand two and seventy five dollars fifty to the further extension of mortise timber and post rails fence along the beaconsville road boundary up to an additional 200 second though councillor dhoni and council mccarthy um the um director of technical services has um provided some good uh um pictures and data to um to look at whilst we 've been sorting this out um and the the fence that um is currently proposed uh the um the heritage group and the uh connell valley group are all uh extremely happy with it they reckon that 's exactly what they wanted it 's a great choice um the um [Music] the fact that it 's um we had a bit of a discussion trying to um you know fit it within budget and it 's really good that it 's the whole project has come in not only within budget but with the ability to shift a little bit of money saved in the pathway over to actually getting more fence from the original proposal [Music] i am quite pleased with this report i think it could give us an outstanding little public asset down there with that pathway coming down from the intersection of the mutton falls road all the way down past the cafe into the um uh just looking at like a really wonderful uh public asset so i just commend this report to the uh to the council thank you council dhoni castle uh i 'll stay with the report thank you thank you council mckibben um thank you mr acting mayor i would make the comment no sorry there 's a phone ring in the background um the only thing i support it but the only thing that worries me is page 65 the tender by um by brian mark to the technical services director halfway down page 65 it said all labor exceeding the included 90 hours will incur an hourly rate of 40 dollars so my mind from reading many many tenders over the years immediately gets sparked to say they 've allowed for 90 hours but it could exceed 90 hours and if so they 're going to charge 40 dollars an hour because perception why you would believe this was a fixed price tender but with that out there it is not a fixed price tender so i think we should be going back and insisting that they do accepted um because otherwise if it takes 150 hours for every hour over 90 we 're going to be charged 40 so we 're not going to have the surplus that recommendation who says so what and in any case with those words there recommendation two would have to be changed and because we cannot specify with specificity what that surplus is going to be on the basis that this is not a fixed price quote with those words halfway down page 65. general manager i 'm happy to give the tech services director to comment you need one mute chris yeah thanks mr maybe um yes this is a attended quotation uh again 90 hours is equivalent to to two and a half to three weeks to erect at the rate of i think two to three three men uh in that uh in that inclusive price again it 's very hard to put uh you know a total time frame on that uh there is a provision there yes for 40 per minute i have actually had that discussion with the the contractor and again certainly they 've something uh did exceed that 90 hour mark uh but again the likelihood that i 've been advised is not likely that it will again that there is a provision you will note in the report as i said the surplus funds from the footpath certainly could absorb costs and i have mentioned that you know should council get on the path of extending the timber fence along beaconsfield road that the fence could be extended up to an additional 200 meters so again there has to be a little bit of flexibility uh built in to this uh this particular project counselor um [Music] if it was the agreed by uh general manager and yourself from the meeting number two could be slightly changed so as not to alter the intent of the motion just some of the detail so it could read something like uh normally nominate the use of surplus funds without mentioning any sum and then i 'm just leaving out the distance if you feel that was still within the spirit of the motion so would read something like nominate the use of surplus funds fence along the beacons field road boundary cars mccarthy please to be honest i 'm sorry i missed your first couple of words well i think i think you 're getting we 've called call for a quote we 've received a quote i think it 's got to stay as it is but my question to the director also what we got in there is um in in this quote is a is that the removal of the old fence as well is that in the scope of works uh yeah through the chair that does include the removal of the old fence uh two to waste facility yes that 's correct uh uh uh i 'm just a bit concerned i 've given the flexibility of the yeah anyway that that 's my concern that we prayed someone to give a quote and the quotes as it is and that 's what it should be to be honest counselor mckibben um i think council mccarthy 's missing the point here in that the tender has given a let out in that they 've said they 've allowed for that they charge us 40 hours my view is they should have said we will do it for 90 hours whatever because they 've put the lead out there we then can 't specify what the surplus and it may cost us more i mean i think we should have a requirement on this company that once they get to 90 hours they have to stop work and just specify any extension to the technical services director and give reasons as to why it is going over the 90 hours that would be the normal course of events and then it would be that ex like any variation under a project then it 's up to the technical services director if it 's within his delegation and the contract management policy and if not then it got to go to the general manager as a variation over that 90 hours that 's my view um and then if we 've got the second recommendation and that 's to apply then the surplus fund but first of all i think the chandra should be required to do the work and we if there 's any extension over that then they 've got it it 's got to be by a variation and that has to be justified and approved by the technical services director if it 's within his delegation if it 's in within the 10 or whatever the rule is under the contract management policy and if not then it 's got to go to the general manager general manager and technical services director please comment [Music] okay councillor gibbons said the chair you know i believe attend as a tender and uh it 's too loose ended like that unless uh after the tenders there 's more work there to do well he 's given his hourly rate but just as it is there a bit loose ended to me yeah i 'll come back to you council danny councillor uh mckinney yeah yes mr acting mayor i had quite a bit to do with tenders over the years and to me it 's very open-ended if there are extenuating circumstances or a valid reason for extras they are normally discussed when the contracted or quoted time has a percentage in the original tender as a contingency so i think to accept this leaving us open to um you know an over expenditure that we um that we probably shouldn 't be being liable to incur so i i agree with um with councillors givens mccarthy and uh mckibben that uh yeah this this tenders this quotation is uh it 's not tight enough and i i wouldn 't be accepting it if it was my money coin general manager thank you mr chair i want to cast council 's minds back to one meeting ago where you developed a contract management policy a project management policy and a procurement policy as part of this project we will put together a contract that will outline exactly what councils have raised as their concerns the contract as is is to establish 200 metres of fence for 90 hours and that 's how the contract will be will be prescribed i 'm noting that they have indicated that if there 's more than 90 hours worth of work there then they will need to come back to us in order director has indicated he has been in negotiation and certainly conversation with the with the current um contractor and they believe that they 'll do it within the 90 hours so the contract that we develop and get the contract door to sign will specifically outline what the requirements are and they 'll be in bait around the quotation that 's being provided so it won 't go over 90 hours because there 's a provision in our contract management procedure the base said when we prepare a document we give those limitations out so simply is the quote is for that for is for 43 700 for 90 hours of work to create 200 metres of fence if it was to is there some variation or some other issues that they 're having milestones within that contract will need to be met because that 's how we now develop our contracts so i 'm hoping that that gives councillors some assurance about how this project will will move forward because we 're putting processes in place that outline what we expect from the contractor to do these things in that there is additional funds to an additional 200 million so if you add 46 000 to 43 000 they are different but we 're still wanting 200 moves offence so there is some contingency in there should there be reasonable um need to utilize that that funding and that is the contingency that the director could use as part of finalizing this process i hope that that gives some certain clarity and some comfort around how this project will will move forward from this from this point based on the quotes of intersect council dona you write a reply thank you mr acting mayor i um i too noticed that um that comment um i support the prudence that uh other councillors have discussed um of you know the possibility of shooting over at forty forty dollars an hour um but i i and general managers reference to recently adopted policies and how they can be exercised in this case i think is all doing our job exactly right um i just draw your attention to point one of the motion the point one of the motion says proceed a quoted cost of 43 750 along the frontage of the o 'connell recreation ground that point one already sets the limits that councils have been talking about it is not an open-ended um uh recommendation it is a recommendation um set firmly at forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty so i i um i think this is um worked out well i think uh our council is doing its job well thank you councillor dhoni um i 'll put the motion uh the recommendation all in favor uh councilman kevin you 're in favor councilman kevin or against i can 't tell okay sorry he said in favor okay thank you that 's unanimous uh for councils and staff um it is my intention that if we slow down from now on uh that we will take a break for 15 minutes at about eight o 'clock or a convenient time around that uh our staff have been working a full day and now continuing on and uh i don 't think it is wise to not have a break uh because otherwise we will start they will as well so plan on a break for about 15 minutes around about 8 o 'clock all right item 1311 bitchman spray seal tender for the campbells river and abercrombie road project recommendation that one council nominate the open tendering method as prescribed in accordance with clause 166 alpha of the local government regulation 2005 for the provision of the bitumen spray seal sealed services for both the fixing local roads and safer roads projects and two at the conclusion of the tender period a detailed report be called brought back to council meeting at the council meeting of october 2020 for the adoption of a suitably qualified company to complete bitumen spray ceiling work associated with both the fixing local roads and safer roads project do i have a mover and a seconder councilor mckibben and councillor cable council mckibben um thank you mr eckie mayor uh having read this paper it 's some obviously prudent we have to obviously get a tender for this bitumen spraying for what is a quite a lengthy project and i 'm assuming that this will cover stages one stage two and stage services director but i think the bitumen in sections were basically sections to stages two and three and stage one was purely stabilization so i would move this recommendation in two parts number one as as a as a multiple uh recommendation parts one and two thank you councilman kevin councillor cable thank you mr acting thank i look forward to the report coming back to council for our decision uh in october thank you council cable anyone else wish to wish to comment okay to put the motion in two parts those in favor goes against nil motion is passed all right item 1312 on page 69 participate in regional contracts for the supply and delivery of road signs the recommendation is that council agreed to participate in the regional procurement contract for supply and delivery of road signs to provide and and to provide the central new south wales joint organization with advice accordingly mover and a second to please councilman kevin and councillor gibbons thank you mr acting thank you mr acting mayor obviously we have considerable benefits from the joy procurement uh operations and we get the procurement i suppose what 's of interest is on page 70 um that our expenditure on signs for 1819 and 1920 um was relatively small compared to most of the other um other councils in the area um in fact i think cumulatively it was the smallest um by at least two thousand dollars but it 's so it shows that we could benefit to aven as a small council from the bigger buying power of the joint organizer the bigger councils involved as well so i would move the recommendation mr mayor mr acting man thank you councillor mckibben uh council gibbons through the chairs the only way to go and has been covered well there by councilman kevin so support the recommendation thank you council gibbons any other comments casey put the motion all in favor and against nel nil motion passed next item is 1401 reports for information um sorry yeah through the tarot down no you you know hurry um but you 've missed 13 13. just oh sorry i have two how could i miss the master plan all right 13 13 the abroad two parts but i am going to put a couple of minor amendments in before we uh call for uh movers and that is uh in the first part of the recommendation that should read the draft common master plan be supported in principle by the council um and in the second uh part of the recommendation that council allocate sixty thousand dollars uh from the common fund for the purchase and installation of 40 living treasure plaques have you got those sharon so the recommendation is in two parts the draft common master plan be supported in principle by council and placed on the public exhibition on public exhibition from thursday 24th september to friday the 6th of november 2020 that community submissions be invited during the exhibition period two council allocate sixty thousand dollars for the purchase and installation of forty living treasure plaques in the in the oberon common um let me say it again council allocate 60 000 from the common fund for the purchase and installation of 40 living treasures parks in the oberon common do i have a mover and a seconder councillor cable mayor uh it 's a pleasure to uh to move this uh recommend recommendation be uh adopted it 's been a trend tremendous amount of work done on the master plan over a fair period of time we 've all been involved we 've all had a fair bit to say about it and i think what we 've come up with is a really good final draft i look forward to hearing what the community has to say after it goes on exhibition i think the allocation of the money for the plaques for the living treasures i think uh is a great idea we we did uh mess around earlier on uh wondering whether we might do them in stages but i think uh it is it is uh the best way to go that we um we do the whole lot in one go and then they 'll all be the same and i think i think it will be a tremendous addition to the common thank you thank you council line thank you acting man um it 's good to see that we now have a this common uh a place of some renown in oberon you can see it 's being very well used by the public and the general population in this town um i think we 're setting a good example thank you thank you thank you council line uh any other any other comments please council mccarthy just a clarification but i thought we um agreed to get rid of the um viewing platform so i i it 's level with the end of the car park and towards the east and it says place of viewing area at the highest point i thought originally it was a viewing point on top of a tank and then i thought we agreed to just get rid of it entirely but my concern is if we 're going to develop this plan and it goes out in the public which is fine do we have the funds to grow graze grass over the area and that or is that a revote of money when we get submissions from the public because we have a lot of money in in this to in the development the best way to move this walk forward would be on the back of the submissions received from the public a report be tabled to the working party that can then look at the priorities that they would like to see moved to progress the the development of the common master plan upon its adoption so the recommend the recommendation simply states that in principally councils support it let 's put it out on exhibition for the community to have a look at and have their say in what they want to see proceed within the within the parameters of the con thank you general manager uh council danny you had you indicated you wanted to speak thank you mr acting mayor um yes i i think um we can expect uh an active response from the oberon community as as um as is always their way on things that are important to them in their town um and i 'm quite sure there will be compliments and a few brick bats as well um uh i i 've just got to say the living treasures the 10-year guarantee um a long time uh that means that 's six thousand dollars a year uh those things will cost us um i i just hope we 've got them in storage so we can redo it in 10 years but um otherwise i think you know we we um you know i look forward to wrestling with the issues that the public 's brings up with this and uh i support uh this master plan thank you anyone else uh from my perspective i 'm very pleased to support the master plan going on public exhibition i think it 's a the common is a wonderful asset to this town and this master plan will enhance it over time over my time here i 've often seen the living treasures living legends um in their hanging place in the robert hooper centre where very few people see them and i think having them out in a public space where facsimiles can be seen and the originals can then be kept in a safe place away from light and and properly stored is an excellent way of doing business and we 'll people um if there 's no one else wishes to speak i 'll put the recommendations all in favor against unanimous all right thank you and now we get to 1401 the general manager 's monthly activity report the recommendation is that the item 0 1401 is received as information a mover and a second applies council gibbons and council mccarthy councillor gibbons yeah just a a good report a full report uh over slowing things down here and there a bit but uh yeah happy with the recommendation council mccarthy yeah pretty straightforward thank you um uh deputy mayor uh anyone else wish to comment uh council mckibben councilman kevin um thank you mr acne mayor uh thank you mr acting mayor bottom of page 75 um do we know when the request for tender will be issued out for the pool and fitness centre general manager through the chair i 'm just uh wading through a number of comments that were made by certain councillors in regards in putting this plan together um let me also say thank you to that certain counsellor for their input um uh would hope by the end of this week follow-up counselor if i could comment that certain counselor sorry that certain counselor can provide assistance i indicated in certain areas if required so please don 't hesitate to call that certain counsellor all right um the incident from the administration center which i think is a wh s issue which was referred to on page 76 i wasn 't sure what it meant when it said a staff member sustained an injury aligning the administration building does that mean they jumped off the roof they fell over the step or um came in contact with the door i just wasn 't sure what a lighting meant whilst it was moving all right um general manager a lighting in this instance was removing themselves from the office and a incident occurring when they tripped over a mat thank you for clarification i i thought it might have been something worse more in the light of what council donai was sending apart from that i um yeah i have no further comments on that uh anyone else with comments or questions acting all all in favor against uh motion passed all right uh item 1402 monthly activity report planning and development uh recommendation that the item is received as information mover and a though uh council dhoni and councilman kevin councillor donai um thank you thank you mr acting thank you mr again here uh extensive report forgive me i i i called on councillor donai council kevin you 're you 're the second forgive me i uh councilman kevin i 'm sorry i forgot to unmute myself uh i am um uh happy with the content of the report uh mr general manager and mr acting there thank you councilman kevin councilman kevin councilman kevin are you hearing me ah thank you mr acting man i 'm i 'm having a little trouble with my internet connection everything 's a bit delayed um um that 's probably me so um um i um yes i commend the report it 's lengthy i would just like to in relation to the fitness center um we approved rather an extensive variation i thought somewhere in this project to in hence the um enhance this the original cost estimate uh because from what i understood it was more than the thirty four thousand dollars stated there is an approved variation um i might be wrong and if that is the case then does that still bring it within the the original expenditure amount i thought it was um quite a large variation and had been recommended to us by our project management company at the time um to enhance the facility to make it more appealing to the community and that was approved by council so i 'm just wondering how that in the original cost estimate to bring us total expenditure and how that fits with the original budget estimate that 's my first question uh the director of planning i 'll go through the general manager happy for the director to comment if that 's correct uh through the chair um it was a lot larger than the thirty four thousand dollars uh we this was straight from the uh project management team they gave us a final report and this was purely put out that report they had those numbers inside the council report i can 't get it to you offline if you so desire but it 's in your project plan through the chair just add to that that does include the variations of the change in scope in the original in the original cost estimate so can we have a total yet so we can we get a total price breakdown from the original estimate with the variations to get us to the total project costs um so we know you know where it fits and whether where the money where the money 's come from i.e what we 've been given with the grant and what excess we 've had to pay if any through the chair there is no excess it fits within the project plan and happy to close out report to you you happy with that uh councilman mckibben i am if if it also goes to all councillors i think it should go to that greg provide that report to all councils if you would please general manager that would be our intention mr chair thank you so just going to the second but page 83 um on the living units um independent living units um so that actually as i understand it sets out the full price increase so we 've got the original contract amount preliminaries approved variations the carport 's landscaping so we 're over budget by four thousand is that correct do i read that correctly um i 'm under budget by four thousand or are we under budget by 4 000 we 're under budget by 4 000 is that how i read it sorry yes and and when do we believe it 'll be completed through the chair uh hopefully the next three or so weeks as i mentioned in the report there 's been some delays with gas connection but um yeah sorry i missed that through the chair by early october pretty sure so there 'll be a full report at the next meeting um i move the recommendation the report at 1402 be accepted by council thank you now any other questions or comments council mccarthy um yes miss deputy mayor um where does it show the reinstatement of the um double garage that was chair that 's in the carport 's landscaping it 's in that one it 's in that section there i didn 't yeah no that 's that 's fine and the other one was its council agreed we 've missed two heritage meetings um with council agree to we maybe um have the next heritage meeting at the um o 'connell bushfire shed it seems that you can fit a few more people in down there and due to the age of the participants maybe that would be a better venue site i think we can get 18 or 20 down there can we whereas we can only get 12 in the chambers how does this can feel i think we need to check that i thought 12 was probably well maybe maybe you 're right could be as high as 18 i 'm just thinking how many we had about 12 there last night we could take more uh council mccarthy i i i think as chairman you 'll you have that um ability to move the the location to suit the circumstances and i think if the fire further comments all right all in favor against nil okay thank you very much item 1403 monthly activity report technical services and the recommendations the report be received as information can i have a mover and a second to please uh council mckinney councillor gibbons councilman cagney ah yes mr acting mayor a um a good report and a challenging time with snow events and some storms but just one question on on page 88 under water and sewer we the last sentence the source of dirty water is yet to be determined with flushing of the mains the only solution at present [Music] this is rare to chat again today and uh and yesterday several residents who had calls and inspired several residents down the street different areas of town with pretty ordinary water they had some samples and showed me and i hoped that they they took the advice and referred the complaints to straight to the council i think they did some of them at least this is a been an ongoing problem for a while and it 's sporadic around town i think so i just 're actually doing about it besides flushing one resident told me yesterday work they were advised to flush their own water main using the garden hose but you know i don 't think that 's an acceptable response i don 't know what the response or what the actual corrective actions are but i 'm just wondering if we could get an update on on what we are doing about it and um and what the plans going forward are to remedy to remedy it if i could please second service director uh yeah thanks mr mayor um yeah certainly with the lower dam levels has created uh a lot more turbidity with the raw water into the treatment plant and also with the the pleating levels in the dam which were happening until recent rainfall and like which has been positive damn going back the other way still the uh the takeoffs have had high manganese uh coming into the water treatment plant now that also has caused issues with uh the filtration of water certainly the membranes requiring more frequent cleaning um and and and has has a tendency even though coming out clear on the uh in in within the water it 's is of no no health concern but uh it does have a tendency to uh over time uh cling to the inner linings of uh pipe work and with that has a tendency also to uh to release as it becomes deposited within within pipes and chases through the system so that can create certainly more dirty border issues uh you know that do go with the water demand through the water reticulation pipelines through the through the town the remedy of what we are doing at the minute is certainly monitoring those issues but the plumbing staff are flushing hydrants and like we have certainly put something an advertisement out on facebook today indicating uh much the same but also advising that you know if residents are experiencing water issues um certainly you know they can assist by flushing uh or releasing water through their individual taps but again contacting council so we and certainly get around and let some water out of the hydrants in in in the side of actually trying it is an ongoing issue but manganese appears to be one of the key elements or culprits involved with the dirty water at the minute thank you uh councillor gibbons yeah through the chair just as the roadside vegetation works the excavator and mulches seems to be going gangbusters clearing the canopy just wondering you keep a record of kilometres done versus hours completed or not there through the chair i i don 't actually have that record but i certainly could facilitate out of interest some statistics on that yes i could do that well thank you then it just gives you a bit of an idea of how we 're going and how much work 's involved and how long just on page 88 there 's just a spelling mistake we 've got maybe israel there under the works on local roads it should be new views with the n-u-p-i-e-r halfway down the page um don 't suppose we 've heard anything else with regards to shep 's hill and the the road works of the foreign police out that way uh through the chair um certainly we currently facilitating some geotechnical investigation work which is envisaged to happen here in the next few weeks the rms are undertaking what their transport for new south wales as as they formerly were roads and maritime services uh undertaking those uh particular geotechnical investigations and will form the uh the basis of the outcome for uh pavement repairs through that wattle grove section of road that they actually completed around about two years ago yeah just the last one the tennis of external meetings is the central new south wales joint organization water utilities any comments on that movie technical director uh no it 's more operational um matters in relation to uh you know joint council businesses i suppose running their their water facilities and alike uh at this stage there 's really nothing to report other than uh concern around ongoing um monitoring of covert and the like uh in and through uh syria 's treatment plants at this stage i mean open council has been quite fortunate we haven 't had any cases but um uh you know certainly uh it may be something that council looks future thank you uh council dhoni thank you just acting there um just a couple of comments at 87 karlwood road i 've been along there a few times on the western end where they 're extending through the saunders road and um i 'd have to compliment the work crews that 's um that 's a really rough patch of land and road surface to be working through there just you know stones of every size really so i think they 're doing a pretty good job through there um page 88 uh parks and gardens last sentence staff have continued to manually clean the town gutters where 's our gutter cleaner uh where 's our truck yeah through the chair certainly we have taken delivery of the truck we are just facilitating the uh the staff training now to to get that up and running um talking about gutters primarily in the main cbd area is where that cleaning is still actually occurring at this stage so uh but we will and envisage to have that training up and running here in the next couple of weeks and in in the apparatus of that machinery thank you um page 90 if i may yes 19th of the 8th 2020 trade waste borg oberon you know borg is you know they 're central to the economic health of the town in so many ways and we used to sell them a lot of water uh and that fell away and we used to sell them a lot of waste which that fell away too just what was the nature of that meeting uh through the chair again uh the nature of that meeting was in conjunction with the uh project manager for the urban series treatment plant uh borg have uh or requested council to come and discuss uh their business opportunities with relation to the reverse osmosis in their ongoing water treatment processes as part of their business and what opportunity they may have in terms of getting their uh their i suppose their brine water from their processes to a point where it may be possible for consideration and uh seeking concurrence of the state government uh to then discharge back to open councils uh new water so it was really getting an idea of uh you know what that i suppose that makeup is of their business and working with council in in relation to a a potential discharge into the future could i paraphrase that to say that um we they 're suggesting and i i think this is a really interesting that in fact we could be in a position where we will be buying water from law absolutely no through the chair can i kind of just make some just some further clarification just to just to support chris in this instance and that is if all were to look at a trade waste agreement it would be for everything other than their brine water from their reverse osmosis yeah so they are in fact looking at ways that they could potentially discharge into our our system articulated system and they would pay for the privilege of doing that all right that 's what i was just but it is not for the brine water because the brine water can 't_''_7791.84 go through any treatment process it 's everything but their blind water couple and what what quality is that water after reverse osmosis should be fairly good i 'm assuming after reversals most of they can use it on their own side if they want if it 's that good it 's not the the legislation weren 't allowed at this point in time for for an stp to have salt water go through your treatment works that 's my understanding at this point in time interesting um and just a general one um i think i made the comment a couple of times recently and i and i think there 's no shortage of effort i was looking at the pave liner working out on the abercrombie road i look at um the efforts along the o 'connell road um and i don 't know whether it 's weather or that simply i for a layman i can only say it 's the weight of the vehicles on our roads but um uh you know they they are taking a bit of a pounding um uh you mentioned sheps hill um there 's just a number of places at the moment where a ship where a truck shifts gears or brakes or turns is really showing up on our road network at the moment and i think we need to lobby for um compensation for uh for you know carrying that that freight weight on our um on our area road um continue thank you mr acting there thank you council mckibben um thank you mr acting mayor um a couple of a few issues one is um if we 're getting there uh reverse osmosis water from or considering it surely it 's a possibility it could be used to water our playing fields if nothing else and any proposed new playing fields and that should be put into the mix um because it would certain only be suitable for that as i understand it um and and if it had to go through the stp we 'd also need to consider whether that plant the new plant would have the capacity i 'm assuming it does from the figures but anyway for consideration by the general manager and the technical services director a third of the way down works concern is here that it says that mount david road goes from barrier to abercrombie road actually goes from burriga road to campbell 's river road last wednesday i noted that the mulcher and vehicles had all stopped at mount david and since last wednesday the mulcher has disappeared yet it has left the piece of road from mount david to burricaro not done and i was assured by the technical services director that this bit would be done uh could i ask the technical services director therefore um as the motion has disappeared and has not reappeared since i last saw it parked at mount david on wednesday where it has gone and isn 't intended to come back yeah through the chair um thanks counselor mckibben uh yeah the mulcher has correctly finished right to mount david and again yes i have uh as you correctly point out indicated that it will complete that section from mount david road through to burrigan road we have had to take it through to some other projects at the minute on both edith and edith road and then on to on project works because there 's some new uh upgrade work being done on particularly on the edith road on one bend up from mcgill 's creek it 's not feasible to put the machine on on new work afterwards uh so again in conjunction with moving back out towards campbell 's river road the machine will return and do that section of road um from mount over road through to burrica road as as indicated to you uh general manager would you like to um provide a small commentary on uh councilman kevin 's observation about watering playing fields with the residue of a reversal osmosis plant um yeah through the chair just by way of a bit of information borg 's is what we call a class c polluter which means they 're an indus industrial polluter which means that the way that you get a trade waste agreement it has very specific conditions attached to it none of which would relate to watering playing fields with that with that type of um product once again we would not be looking to utilize any brine water or any reverse all the other water that comes from their site or and it 's only whether we can accommodate it or not um as chris indicated it 's early stages and they 're looking at their options so that we won 't we couldn 't use um a classy trade waste um pollutant in on our playing fields which it just wouldn 't be allowed all right thank you general manager any any other comments council mccarthy um thank you um to the director i 'm out on the meadows road about halfway along what i call kenmar 's house why is the pavement falling apart and being patched and it 's on the um side to sit mainly on on whether trucks aren 't loaded what was the road base falling apart and had it been patched through the chair uh having looked at that particular section of road it seems to have got water into the the subsurface of it um and with trucks actually the way and the speeds that have been on that particular road and again it is on a corner i believe that the trucks and it has stripped off so um with that additional weight loading uh i believe the actual bitumen probably has lifted uh under the stress of the trucks and the speed they 've been traveling i have requested uh forestry corporation [Music] restrict or reduce the uh or tell the uh all these companies to uh reduce their speeds down to 60 kilometers to assist council in terms of the uh the conditions of the road at the currents at the current time so you 're saying that they 're getting onto the wrong side the road loaded uh through the chair when i was at the day looking at the particular payment there was uh was trucks observed you know certainly trailing what i would consider probably higher speeds and i would anticipate on that particular road okay thank you um could we pass to the staff a big thank you for their snow input it was really good and just with parks and gardens can we have a look at the walla mine pine i went up there yesterday there 's a stack of rubbish stacked around it think it needs some of the bottom limbs cut off it hasn 't changed since we asked some work to be done at christmas time and we asked it to be watered but it was a gift to us i think the bushfires impacted on a lot of one of my points and i think we need to preserve this one that we 've been given as a present thank you all right any other questions if not i 'll put the the emotional in favor thank you unanimous um next item is 1404 the month the activity report for corporate services and and the recommendations the item be received as information a mover and a second to place uh councillor mckibben and councillor dhoni councilman kevin um thank you mr mayor yes an informative um informative paper um i was um sorry i missed the walk and talk for life but unfortunately i had children playing football that day so it was um i had to attend um and i note that the director of community services included a section on the i.t and information technology on page 92-93 end of october 2020 with one rather of the providers um named and that we 'd like to obviously keep us informed no doubt there 'll be a a very extensive report in what 's happened in an october report um the exhibitions obviously are interested and obviously community technology is continues to be a major interest in these covert times so thank you i 'd move the recommendation uh council dhoni thank you mr acting mayor i too am quite pleased with the report uh i 'll be interested in the area of information technology to see um apparently we 're waiting for some sort of resubmission from civica and to see if they are they 're you know capable and willing to do a better job um just one of my little piccadillos that annoys me that they call it the icloud and then make us feel good that they 've launched a product called altitude which gives us the impression that all this wonderful stuff is benignly floating up into the sky and it 's not a problem they would be better to call their software um this is reliant upon huge economic computer houses council dona is that relevant to this particular report only to me sir only okay well let 's let 's move on then thank you most like the chance uh is there anyone else who has comment uh councilman kevin oh sorry look it was just a um a repercharge to council dhoni with the issues we 've had with civica to date maybe they should rename their uh program attitude thank you councilman kevin my previous comment applies all right i 'll put the motion all in favor unanimous and where are we statement investments items 1405 on page 96 the council received the report as information a mover and seconder councillors it 's about the lapse uh council mccarthy and councillor dhoni yes the the report 's pretty straightforward uh hacking there the only thing i 'm i was wondering but uh we get a report that there 's 16 million dollars 930 000 there um could we in the future get boxes so that the councillors know what money is available in each fund in other words when someone a list that there 's x amount of dollars in that uh or this restricted fund that there 's x amount of dollars that would put away for the staff entitlements at possibly 70 but i think we get this report that we got this money but as as we 've seen in the last couple of weeks when some councils are looking to support something with some funding we don 't have that detail anyway it 's just food for thought that we can maybe change this report uh council mccarthy i i i sympathise but this is an investment report but i would like the general manager to comment on the ability to provide a report about where uh restricted funds are and section 92 for example and and the level of that funding general manager yeah i 'm happy to defer this to the corporate services director who will answer it you acting mayor um the uh restricted funds are incorporated into the quarterly budget review is just not it 's just not practical staff would not be able to manage to report it on a monthly that we provide in the quarterly budget review to include it but i 'm sorry we just could not do it monthly i 'd be happy with the quarterly that would be fine thank you okay uh council danny thank you mr acting mayor i am i pull from the front of my diary the um note 6 restricted from funds cash cash estimates and assessments provided by the director it doesn 't allocate it functionally but it does break it up into restricted internal and external then current assets and non-current assets i do appreciate any guidance on functionality would be good but i do appreciate that would be very difficult to achieve thank you i support the recommendation thank you council danny anyone else all right put the motion all in favor against unanimous all right 1406 monthly grants update recommendation uh is that the report item 1406 has received his information move in a second to please um councillor mckibben and councilman kickby councilman kevin uh thank you mr acting mayor a detailed report um it 's good to see down page 99 that our campbell 's is uh hopefully we may have a determination shortly and that would be good because that would obviously fit in with our other uh 4.8 million for the campbell 's river camels river road work that 's currently being done and we 'll be able to know where we are with that um i it 's also good to see that the grant the round two of the vmt grant program 8 000 for the tapestries is in progress um and it was being lodged and the also the safer roads program where we 've uh obviously the cluster of accidents on that edith road stretch also which is good is the ground application in progress for the swallow 's nest bridge being a user of that swallows nest bridge i know how narrow it is and i wouldn 't if you come down there like hit at night and you don 't turn quickly to the right or quickly to the left depending on which way you 're coming you could miss the bridge completely i 'm actually surprised um but we haven 't lost a few more cars pleasing to see that we 're making a grant for that wooden bridge to be to be replaced and hopefully realigned as well if that can be done at the same time so i would uh move the recommendations this report be accepted mr acting mayor thank you very much uh councilman cagney ah yes mr acting man nothing further to add um just to comment on uh been a lot of positive feedback as the report says but i 've had a lot of positive feedback on the fitness centre so i 'll just just add that as a as a note nothing else to add okay councillor dhoni castle doning newton myself thank you mr acting there i just note on grants in grant applications um seventh of july burger war memorial community war memorials fund eight thousand dollars pending there 's another one in there for um o 'connell which is ten thousand dollars pending i have seen it in this list before i 'm not sure why it 's not in there tonight um it just the swallows nest road bridge you know how i feel so the intention is to replace the timber bridge with um the new concrete bridge is that how i should read that technical services director yeah through the chair that 's correct it 's fixing country bridges which primarily targets the longevity replacement of timber bridges which this one is uh certainly of a vintage that it does require certainly significant work will ideally replacement for for a a better outcome for life of asset so that 's the intent at this stage thank you uh mr acting mayor uh anyone else got questions or comments council mccarthy yes um just to swallow this bridge um i believe there 's a contractor in the district that has a modular bridge formation that 's already engineered and approved are we considering that rather than box culverts that continually need to be cleaned out like the abercrombie um crossing down there that um we 've been there down there to clean the box culverts out haven 't_''_8972.399 we we 're starting with more opening under a bridge lets the rubbish flow through and keeps going downstream that 's all just ask me through the chair uh yeah certainly uh not december to what was done on the kaner walls road is a a full span spanning bridge so that is what is being proposed and it is a modular bridge it 's very very much the same as what was done there and again in answer to your uh bridge question about abercrombie briefly working with that balochlinshire council again that asset is actually uh belonging to the lachlan shire council i realized that anyway thank you for your input all right if there 's no more questions or observations i 'll put the motion all in favor against milt unanimous all right uh water usage drought assistance uh recommendations this report item 1407 be received and noted mover and secondary councillor cable council mckibben councillor cable thank you mr thank you distracting mayor um yeah a good report uh pleasing to see that the water consumption trend uh is uh way down on the same time last year for obvious reasons um and it 's also very pleasing to notice that the um damn sits at 30.1 i don 't know that we have not seen it move for a long time thank you uh uh councilman kevin uh thank you mr acting man no further comments to those uh made by the mover uh councillor cable uh put the most emotional in favor i 'd commend the recommendation uh that 's unanimous and the 1408 water and sewage sewer plant report recommendations 14 oas received as information uh mover and secondary council gibbons and council dhoni council gibbons yeah fairly straightforward averaging other times so uh yeah leave that for information thank you uh council danielle get to your next uh council line council dona thank you mistaking me i 'm happy with the report thank you council line thank you acting mayor i just have a question about the on page 105 halfway down the page um is the is that the average of 200 kilograms of rags collected normal uh through the chair um it certainly does fluctuate but certainly for the month um during august that 's what was actually uh collated or collected there at that particular pump station which is is quite a large volume expectation does the general public need an education on what should go in the toilet or down the system [Music] because we have this problem that these sort of things block up the system and as a cost is there um and since i i used covered uh when toilet paper was in short supply um people were putting using anything and everything um on in the toilet but it is a problem with the nappy liners and things like that that shouldn 't go down the system and i 'm just wondering whether we should have a bigger education move to explain to the pub general public what should go in the toilet and what should go through our system uh yeah through the chair certainly we have had um certainly community awareness campaigns put through the community newsletter and alike uh alluding to uh certainly the do 's and the don 'ts and you are correct in saying in terms of uh wet wipes and all nappy components not suitable to put or dispose of into the sewer system so we did have certainly uh ongoing issues through to run a uh you know community newsletter um or an article to that effect so it certainly has come down but again it 's uh it is disappointing at times that we do experience uh influx unfortunately that uh you know we will continue to do as much community consultation as we can thank you any more comments i 'll put the motion all in favor against nil um at this point i 'm going to call on a german of 10 minutes to allow people at comfort stop i think the council resolution will probably take a while and there 's a couple other items that maybe made to take up some time so we 'll continue to keep the zoom links up and i apologize to the people watching that they can just watch a blank screen for 10 minutes and i 'll give the councils an opportunity to make a cup of tea and staff make cup of tea or her comfort stop uh put we 'll just recommencing the ordinary council meeting item 1409 on page 107 the monthly update of status of council resolutions information can i have a mover and a second to please councilman kevin and councillor cable councillor mckibben uh thank you uh mr um acting mayor uh yes that obviously uh as it 's been indicated previous meetings this is a a much more preferable way to view the status of uh council resolutions i just have some a couple of questions the first is in relation to the roadside vegetation management resolution which is on page 113 under 15 200 819 and is then taken up again in page 100 page 118 at 08 1808 20. can i ask through you [Music] acting at mad to the general manager so the roadside vegetation management planners as a result of the resolution of the 18th of august is being amended to take the upper macquarie county council comments etc into account is the roadside

involving rates and the high level of rates um and i was asked whether the general manager had actually responded to that letter to which i could give no reply um apparently the letter was i think it was february from memory um but there was a letter and it also talked about some categories and was council considering subcategories and asked a lot of questions is the general manager aware of that letter general manager i 'm through that jared doesn 't ring a bell i 'm more than happy to take you on notice and have a look but they met that um i i would forward it to the corporate services

um just just some really good projects coming to fruition and my compliments to all within council and council staff who uh helped get them there thank you you canceled only anyone else with the comments council mccarthy yes um on page it spreads over one one one and one one two um that 's a to do with the sport and complex a special report required additional input from consultants um does that take him to consider covert conditions that may be with us forever and part of that is a crowd separation being considered in that additional information uh general manager um a good question councillor look at this point in time cavities with us for quite some time until someone finds a solution to it um we would need to be mindful of that but the specialist reports we are looking for are more in line with traffic management um the the contamination requirements those types of specialist reports that have been um sourced as we speak but yeah it um are there any more comments or observations or questions i 'll put the motion all in favor against ask next item is item 1410 over on library hours and the report of item 1410 is received as information can i have a mover in a second to please counselor dhoni councillor mckibben councillor donai thank you mr acting mayor um yeah very impressive exhaustive report i support the library in all the functions it carries out and in particular is somewhere warm and safe for those who need it to go um the rather exhaustive analysis of 24 7 and extending hours um comes to the right conclusion that it 's beyond a bit beyond our means but i 'm just wondering if we wanted extra hours um is it possible that we offer a part-time position for a few after a few hours and an afternoon so that there 's no member of staff alone in the library during in particular the winter months i just put that out there for consideration but otherwise um a very good report and um such facilities as access and ancestry and to get to the library uh online and use these facilities good report uh councillor mckibben uh thank you mr acting mayor look having asked for this report i accept the findings but i think the investigation was worthwhile it goes from taking the inves investigation i realize it 's um financially beyond our means um i would have thought that we may have been allowed to permit remote access or we do uh remote access via i.t but i was thinking we with proper access cards and things we may be able to allow access other than the necessity for staff there but not a possibility i i accept the the findings and i also note the findings that by far the biggest users of the library are those over 65 and that there is not a huge demand from people in younger age groups which which surprises me to some degree but not all together um thank you i i have pleasure in seconding the report thank you any other uh council 's wish to speak okay in that case i 'll put the motion um all in hub the report the recommendations report 1411 is received as information can i have a mover in a second to please will someone move it councillor cable and councillor donai councillor cable thank you mr acting mayor uh yes i 'm happy to move this report for information um we are going about the investigation in the right way um there 's going to be a lot of um a lot of investigation a lot of work go into anything before the first sod is turned obviously and going to be important as we know that the community is going to be involved in the in the consideration so i 'm i 'm happy to to move the recommendation as information thank you councillor doni thank you mr acting mayor i think i would just repeat um an earlier comment i made about uh the community 's energetic response and opinion to issues that affect them and i think we need to do our best to start calming some of those fears or assuaging or answering some of those questions and so i look forward to this group assisting us support thank you any other comments observations and questions i have one for the general manager and that is that the second paragraph for the comment section um is a little at odds with um the fourth fifth uh when you talk about the initial phases of the oberon community hub would involve demolition demolishing the community centre and you talk about other options and locations would need to be considered can you clarify that slight discrepancy um sure happy to through the chair so initially council needed to put up something to gauge the scope of a project we put that up on the basis of that is the intention previously of the council through its ongoing processes however we need to look at all options when it comes to um discussing a consult and design phase for the community up so the the one two three the let 's call it the fourth paragraph um tries to get some balance around well even though that we 've indicated that that 's where it is because that 's where the the um the the initial scope was provided for the other options and i make a comment in the report that we 've already had members of the community indicating that or well we 'll council look at other options and they should look at other options this is now the time where those options need to be looked at and that 's what the consultant is engaged to do so i just wanted to make it clear that even though the original commentary relates to the hub in its current location there is an element that needs to be looked at and that is is it the best location do we need to go down the path of something else and that 's what this consultant design will do i hope that clarifies it thank you general manager any anyone has have any other comments i put the motion all in favor against that 's unanimous um there is no urgent business at the moment so we 'll move from urgent business sorry from open council to a closed session in accordance with the local government act of 1993 the general regulation 2005 in if in the opinion kind as referred to in section 10a brackets two of the act and should be dealt with in part of a meeting close to the media in public in this case it is section d which is commercial information is of a confidential nature that would if disclosed prejudice the commercial position of a person who supplied it or confer a commercial advantage on a competitor of the council or reveal a trade secret uh can i ask for a a mover in a second to move into closed session uh councillor mckechnie councillor cable all in favor against all right all in favor then uh and we 'll move into closed session um can we stop the uh webinar please at all the the council is back in open session during the confidential section a resolution was made that council accepted tender pricing submission from regional quarries australia propriety limited for a period of up to three years from the 16th of september 2020 to the 30th of june 2023 and also the council authorised a general manager or his appointed delegate to execute contract documents that recommendation was 42 thank you all for your attendance and thank you all to thank staff and councillors _"

interest counsellors page five our declaration thank you we 'll move on to page six item reports for decision item 501 community hub concept plan 1a submissions there is a recommendation there councillors the council will include all submissions together with preferred points indicated at the meeting for consideration during final design of the oberon community hub i need someone to move that recommendation please counselors mccarthy and council cable thank you general manager wants to make a comment um yeah just a council 's um clarity there they 've been furnished with three copies of correspondence in relation to this matter um they 're you 've been provided with all of them and i trust that that will be included as part of your deliberations in use in this process thank you carrie okay counselors council mccarthy i know it 's pretty straightforward we 're going out to the architect as long as and i can 't see in this submission but one of the other submissions were that the toilets for the staff should be separate and uh on board i 'm happy for it to go in um the right thing to do that to include all the submissions um along with their preferred points so unfair to the people who have made those solutions thank you councilman i will just say council that we will need to indicate the preferred points that we want the architect to take on board from this report so i 've already heard council mccarthy mention box gutters and toilets council cable did you have any particular uh yet we need to integrate the one thing that i thought was important is the access to the the auditorium the big auditorium for uh you know if there 's a big event uh there there needs to be adequate reception space for the people leaving the venue i just personally before i go out to the other councillors on zoom i i think we should pay um or ask the architect to pay attention to equipment in in the concept plan that we 've looked at um and also um yeah i think that that 's my main that 's my main thing any other comments on this counselors counseling technique um yes i agree with with all the points so far especially just like the support clive in the the toy on box gutters you definitely should be avoiding them um even if there is a an extra cost involved but we we haven 't been able to avoid what goes um just a couple other points to the um mobility impaired toilets i think we need to make sure that those ramps are um are adequate and that they 're wide enough there 's no detailed drawings yet but we just need to make sure that are very easily negotiable and that um they can conform with the with the specs for those those items the other thing is that 's been raised is the window coverings in floor coverings we we need to look at those and in conjunction with that we need to look at the insulation it 's probably um better in the walls and and then one one great higher than the minimum spec in in the roof both for heating and cooling but we all should be they also should be more important the window wall coverings but we know four coverings just take that insulation there 's no mention of double glazing that 's another point that that 's probably going to come out in the final specifications but it 's also really important that we use double glazing techniques double glazing was indicated in our discussions but i think that one 's fine that 's all i have thank you councilman council online i 'll come with the zoom participants in a moment that 's alone so um yes i um agree with you on the storage um it would be better if it was stored there storage for chairs and furniture and for large fun for the large function space but there 's also storage for community groups um also the um is there space set aside for the historical collections now we 're only a young country but we do have history of this overall special facility like an air conditioner or something um well i have um actually spoken to the librarian i don 't know if anybody else has spoken to the librarian um about this and she 's assured me that everyone has a very small local history collection which does not require special archival actions but does require expanded space so we need space it doesn 't need any um archival um special action for that um it 's mostly consist of the allen brown collection um and that mostly consists of articles and photos that have been photocopied from the oberon review over a 30-year period and these articles are all digitized now and readily available online from a variety of sources and as i said haven 't spoken to the librarian i 've been assured that the current method of storage is very adequate um for all of our local history collection including alan brown when the storage current story for the allen brown collection and the photos was um was carried out by the friends of the overall library on advice from the state library of new south good condition and that 's how it sits at the moment so the librarian has assured me that nothing further is required thank you um the kitchen if we can 't afford to um [Music] put in all of the facilities that could make a commercial kitchen could we sort of have like a planning so it 's designed that it could be a possible addition later so kitchen design thank you councilman thank you any other comments tell us from the kibben mayor have i been unmuted ah thank you um yes look i i welcomed all the submissions i thought they were good i i um fully support uh council mccarthy and councilman kekney in relation to the box gutters issue i think we can if we can avoid them we should at all possibility i also uh in relation to what council mckechnie said i recall them saying the windows would be double glazed because i think i asked the question single double or triple and they said double so i 'm assuming that 's going to be the case in relation to insulation yes i would to be r5 in the walls and and what was going to be in the ceiling and they actually didn 't know um so i would agree with him that we should upgrade the insulation noting the environment we 're in um um to at least r5 r6 in the walls and um similarly in the in the ceiling cavity um i thought a number of the other that the storage of um of chairs and tables etc and needing additional storage was a matter we should take on um i also thought the concept of maybe a larger foyer and exit to i think was dart street should also be noted um and i as part of this consideration obviously i 've put forth a notice of motion for costings on fit out and for through life support which we will need to take into account as well um i know in relation to the council mckechnie 's raised the floor coverings and also window coverings um i 'm assuming that if we 're doing anything [Music] other than what is specified in relation to floor coverings and if that they would be included as part of the fit out cost and not part of this build cost so we might have to look at those separately um the other thing is i noticed there was a bit of contention whether the business room should be smaller or larger i might wonder whether we should look into that a bit further i 'm certainly no expert on that it depends how much the business rooms are going to be used i noticed in the suggestion some suggesting largest i think you and stewart suggested um smaller and more space should be given to other areas but i noticed in um deputy mayor kellums comments that you suggested they 'd be larger so we need to i think as a council we need to uh probably make a direction in that area to the architects rather than leave it up in the air as we may as we probably should do in a number of these things where there is some disparity between opinions thank you madam thank you any other comments councillors councillor gibbons not just the overnights council a bit further includes possible child secure play areas adjacent to moving areas for the young mothers to joint interest groups as they 've been covered i just think there needs to be room there and okay for the for the younger mums and get them involved with the activities thank you councillor callum can we um thank you thank you madam mayor um and uh thank you councillor mckibben for mentioning that the item i raised when i looked at that business plan business center plan i was struck by its uh it was a bit pokey and uh and there were spaces that were dedicated to certain functions where that didn 't need to be the case we have used a large space for the function center which is dividable and i think on a smaller scale that is the same principle we should be using the business center so the rooms are adaptable and are multifunctional where they can be thank you any other comments comes with us yes madam mayor can you hear me okay okay thank you um i don 't wish to run through said they seem to have covered all the salient points that i took down um but i did follow the format aside from making my own list i did follow the format that was in the business papers where it had a range of numbered points and there was it to be indicated whether they were in or out so if i could just ask bear with the recorder i just would like to give those uh that data as to the points that i thought were important there 's a little bit of repetition and they cover most of what the other councillors have said but they also therefore support that argument by that i mean i 'd like to say point one c g and h uh from sig soviet points three five eight and nine um ewan stewart 13 14 16 18. u3a 25 26 28 over on shy ratepayers 29 and 30. callum 34 sullivan 37 and a half and 38. i 'm hoping that when they 're put to the architect they express much the same opinion as the other councillors have put forward i an improvement in the kitchen facilities perhaps not for 250. perhaps an improved library space and i think the points about insulation and floor covers and stuff like that are very important that 's that 's the comment i 'd like to make madame so we have a counsellors councillor kevin i 'm i 'm sorry madame meadow have a repert charge but it was something that was raised uh that tweaked my mind with council of cody and and you 'd be well aware of the issue um in relation to the buriga hall they have actually obtained a quite good value for commercial uh kitchen equipment i think it would be there for and i i 'd suggest this may be outside the architects but council could investigate it that we also that we maybe look at that supplier to actually do some pricing of what commercial kitchen equipment would cost us in the new or second hand to put in that kitchen the proposed kitchen uh to compare it with what a high-level domestic kitchen would cost because i was quite surprised at the pricing and you company in sydney um the other thing i i i did want to pop a comment on was there 's been a couple of suggestions about a pop-up cafe etc which i think 's is a good idea but i don 't think we 've got the funds to put that in now um i don 't know if we we probably can 't even fit it within the uh the total building carcass um but it may be something for the future that the architect could sort of indicate where an area could be or could be added onto the building where one could be added or if it could be done in conjunction with the kitchen um because obviously we would want someone privately to run it so the council 's not running it um so it 'll have to be sort of profitable in its own right it may only operate from certain hours but i think it 's worth consideration uh the other um issue is the child mining center which has obviously been raised as one of the preferable we obviously have to um do as a child minder within the facility and that would be an extra cost to counsel in the operation um i think it 's a it 's a very admirable suggestion and a great idea but i i 'm just not sure how we 're going to cope with staffing it and having an appropriately qualified person to do that because i um obviously having a fiance who 's in the child care and kindergarten area i know the the parameters you have are quite strict in all of this area but i would um just ask those who may be better informed in these areas to comment councilman kevin i think the suggestion was to provide a space not a service are we obliged then to provide a mind if the parent goes away looking for books or on the computer i don 't know what the requirement is library at the moment um that had their own statement okay i 'm happy with that then i i would fully support that on that basis i noticed councillor um dhoni um supported item three in mr sobek 's submission library stacks there are two kinds of library stacks there 's open stacks which are the bookshelves you see in your library and there are what they call hidden stacks which are for items that are seldom borrowed or resources are not available for the public hidden stacks in modern libraries are no longer used there are no hidden stacks anymore hard copies of all publications are kept at the state and the national libraries and can be sourced from there upon request so hidden stacks are no longer a part of modern libraries and of course the national library in the state library do have extensive hidden stats because they supply the rest of the country with books that are not seldom used so a space for hidden stacks in my view is unnecessary and i 've already covered um the humidity and temperature control for the local history collection on advice from our librarian so whether that makes a difference to councillor dhoni 's preference i 'm not sure i 'll go back to councillor dhoni um thank you madam mayor uh my circumstance means i i actually at the same time as i 've got the screen but um no i 'm i 'm quite happy with that um if it 's not too much just return to the pop-up cafe if we have an improved kitchen facility for a pop-up cafe all we need is um not intruding too much on businesses in the main street is a van parked out on the grass verge that can be our pop-up cafe if we have that level of attendance and feel the need to um you know invite a private provider aside from our kitchen facilities which can be run by us or a community group a pop-up cafe can be and we know they turn up to australia those celebrations in oberon that 's all we need thank you okay councillors the general manager has compiled a list here of all of your comments and suggestions i don 't think we need to name them all in the recommendation i think that the recommendation as it stands the preferred points be indicated for the meetings consideration is everybody happy with the recommendation stand as it is i 'm going to put the recommendation counselors all in favor carriage unanimously thank you item 502 counselors on page nine bottle recreation ground waters timber post and rail fencing project there 's a recommendation there that council engage a current fencing contractor to supply and construct the final 75 lineal meters of mortise post and bracket three times rail fence across along the beacon beaconsfield road boundary of the o 'connell recreation ground at a quoted cost of sixteen thousand five hundred dollars x gst that council provide funding from section seven eleven open space contributions and section 711 community facilities fund to complete the o 'connell recreation ground fencing project do i have a mover please councillor gibbons do i have a second one councillor darling thank you you wish to speak to this council gibbons uh through the chair not really but just that uh as the contractors that were involved before they 've done a good job they like the contractors and uh thank you madam mayor um i 've got to say it 's turning into a mighty fine fence down there um we just quote there 's space for caps on the fence posts as well i 'm very pleased it 's grant money and not our money that has done most of the work to this point but we do need to finish it and i think the sources of funds identified are appropriate i can only encourage council that as one of the gateways to oberon council area the fence invites and the way things are proceeding at o 'connell invites a huge amount of favorable comment people think it looks terrific it 's a lovely entrance you 're coming across the river and into the council area i know it has taken significant resources to achieve but i think in the long run um i think it 's going to be um a really positive asset to the council thank you madam mayor thank you councilman can i just note that the 16 500 on the quote doesn 't include the caps if you look at the quote but that the sixteen thousand five hundred recommended by the direct time is just to complete the post and rail fence uh 75 contrary advice and so just technically limit it again i i believe that was part of the one quote i 'm looking at accounts when it isn 't okay and uh just forgive my limited resources what 's the price beside it for cats um tin caps get around 1900 okay i did make a comment to the director of technical services just recently about caps suggesting that perhaps over time um if in if the parties agree village funds could be used to provide caps but i was assured it was part of the coat so well i 'm looking at the quote counsellor and it 's attached to the business paper and it 's definitely separate well it is part of the quote but the sixteen thousand five hundred that 's recommended by the director excludes excludes that okay um well that was the suggestion i made to the director that uh if caps were not included then um in consultation with the right people we might look at seeing if we can use some village funds to finish that uh that point because the caps do need so i i would proceed along those lines with the caps that are met thank you councilman councilwoman cuban um look i 've been back and forward to the uh technical services is directed on this one um what i think we would i would like to see is an account for the 140 000 um for this project under the drought community 's grant to see actually what 's been expended today and how it 's been expended we i would have expected that to come with this to show us that all monies are expended how they 've been expended and that 's why we 're asking for sixteen and a half thousand more um i now understand that there 's been forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty spent on the first two hundred meters forty three thousand seven fifty cent on a second two hundred meters but then i 'm told that we 've actually done 411.5 meters um i find that a little difficult because when i counted the number of panels i came up with 386 meters because each panel is 2.7 meters long as the the um technical services director sort of verifies that the other issue is that we have sprayed with a um a preservative paint the piece along o 'connell road we really need to do the whole fence it 's no good preserving part of it and not and i asked the technical services director and i think it said it cost two thousand one hundred dollars for the painting to do the spraying it 's no good having half the fence sprayed and the other half not sprayed so i think we actually should be looking at including that cost but what i would like to know from the technical services director and i i thought he was going to circulate a paper an exact breakdown of 140 000 because i understood that there was some money left over from the granite path and i 'm not sure where that 's gone and there is also the difference between the 46 270 which was the remaining amount of 140 000 that we allocated to the fence and and the 40 um 3750 which the second lot second amount i don 't we don 't have a breakdown a spreadsheet of how this 140 000 has actually ended up being spent when we went to the recommendation in in september we were working on budgeted figures not actually spent figures we now should have actually spent figures we should actually know whether there 's any money left under that fund to go to this so councillor should should know that so my i reckon i would i 'm foreshadowing an amendment madam mayor that would keep one as it is propose a two council engaged the fencing contract to spray on the beaconsville road fence from wintergreen to the church a protective coating at a price of two hundred and eighty eight seven at two thousand eight hundred eighty eight seven dollars if the technical services director confirms that 's the figure exclusive of gst council reconcile the this is number three ralph council reconcile 140 000 drought communities grant used the o 'connell fence and footpath to ascertain if any funds remain underspent and if so those funds be allocated to one and two above four any shortfall one and two above is to be funded from section 711 open space contributions and section 711 community facilities fund to complete the ocala recreation ground fencing project and five the technical services director verify the length of the fence completed and the existing amounts allocated to the fencing contractor because i can 't get to 411 he assures me it 's 411 but if i count the number of panels it comes to 386. i 'm happy if he verifies and satisfies himself on that um but i don 't think i think the technical services directory said he actually hadn 't been out there to measure or look at if he 'd done it on google so that 's my recommendation i have given a copy of that proposed amendment um to the executive secretary uh so that uh she has it at hand i 'd look for a second for that motion please matter ma 'am okay do we have a secondary i 'll give the executive director a chance to i 'm sorry i 'm gonna have to open my emails and copy it now i some of that before we move it or we 're going to talk about it the amendment we need to talk about we need a second amendment to talk about it counselors the executive assistant has not received the email with the um amendment in it so she 's having to copy that down at the moment i don 't want to bear with this place we need to see what the amendment actually is that you 're not worried about do you get it read it out so we need to have a copy i 'm having already at the because i might have to put another point in so just if council would stick with me the first the first recommendation remains the same the second recommendation is the council engaged the fencing contractor to spray on the beaconsfield road fence from windell green to the church a protected coating at a cost of 2 87. exclusive gst the third is that council reconcile 140 000 drought communities grant used for the ocal fence and for path to ascertain if any funds remain unspent and if so these shortfall in funding after the reconciliation in recommendation three is performed for one and two and is funded from section seven dot eleven open space and section 7.11 community facilities fund to complete the o 'connell wreck ground fencing project and five the technical services director verify the length of fence completed under the existing amounts allocated to the fencing contractor and sharon that should save for 440 000 you get another naughty number three yep would you like to share this video okay house on the cabin is that your amendment iv i think after the words performed for one and two and is funded not funding is funded from it is madame the only thing i would ask the technical services director was the painting done by the fencing contractor i wasn 't sure about that before we go to discussion mccarthy you happy to see that amendment what 's done by defensive contractor that 's right now you wish to speak to the amendment council cricut at all uh well i have spoken to it madam mayor but i would just say that like all projects i when we 're funding it out ourselves we should get a reconciliation of how the money has actually ended up being spent that the grant was for i think this is good practice so we received 140 000 grand we budgeted for certain amounts to be spent we said indicated there was about forty six thousand two hundred and seventy dollars and fifty cents remaining uh um but we noted the time that might be up or down so we should have a reconciliation statement i would have thought as part of the business paper before we actually go to agreeing to provide additional funding i thought that would have been a matter of course of project management we actually should know what the path has cost us what the fence has cost us to where he 's got where the fencing contractors got to and any other costs incurred such as the additional cost for protective coating on the on the o 'connell road fence so that we actually have a breakdown of the actual pricing to see if there is any money left or if we 're in deficit then it may be that we need more than 16 and a half thousand plus the cost of doing it um i just don 't believe um that proper process has been here when when a business paper comes up like this it should include that breakdown and reconciliation of how the grants been spent before we then ask for more money from the council thank you the second thing have you finished counseling given or you still speaking sorry oh sorry i was just speaking to the other areas i i don 't oppose as see obviously using more money i mean we have got um if i can use the term a gold-plated fence here um you know it 's cost ninety thousand a bit over ninety thousand already by the time we get to the end of this it will be 106 to 108 000 i believe um so it 's a very expensive fence i think it 's council donaius they said thank goodness we 've got grant funds for the majority of it um but we certainly want to minimize the amount that we that 's why i 'm saying we need to look at the reconciliation of 140 000. similarly i know this is a highly reputable fencing contractor as councillor gibbons said but um i just couldn 't get to the the length of 411 meters that the technical services director doesn 't know as i said before i just wanted to do a verification doesn 't have to come back to us but he 's just got to convince himself that that 's the correct length um because i just did a count um and couldn 't come up taking each panel length as 2.7 meters i couldn 't get up to 411. i did agree that there 's 755 metres to go that 's that 's not an issue um so there that 's that 's why i have reframed this resolution as i have madame mayor thank you um the general manager has indicated he 'd like to make a comment here um my comment would simply be is that as part of any reconciliation of any kind of grant monies council has to do that through the funding reconciliation um council 's been supplied with a number of quotes and and processes in regards to this project and um has been provided i was of the belief that the um the the matters have been dealt with appropriately uh the matter of of spraying beacons for fence is a matter that the the technical service director took on board to to for in longevity of the fence it 's a protective coating that protects the fence and it 's something that um he and i agree with councillor mckibben within in regards to his into uh his recommendation so um as that as that amendment sits we sit reasonably comfortably with it if it 's the council 's benefit thank you council mccarthy and thank you madam um i spoke to the uh technical services director and suggested if we 're gonna do this extra bit of fence we should have a setback for the filling point incorporated while we 're doing the fence so that it 's maybe had six meters by three metres so you can add the standpipe in that area so we 're not would require probably another thousand dollars or something but we should be considering that i don 't know why the director didn 't put it in the report um because like i said to spoke to him about it um the other thing is what was um when i spoke to the contractor down there i was led to believe that he was doing the fence around little green but apparently it 's changed but he did emphasize that if a stay is not put in on the wooden fence properly the existing vents and they just run the new fence the little green owner just doesn 't do the fence properly that fence will fall over so i think we should engage our contractor to put the stay off that post on the ocon road and the convenience bill rate and appropriate stay whether you want to go denver or metal or allude up the council but he 's at the point where he says that if if it 's not stayed properly his fence will fall over on that end if you get down you want to move i thought we 'd have got a report on the expended money and and i 'll use the carwood road as an example we 've got a grant for the garwood road and i remember what councilman kevin said about if we 've got money left over we 'll do a little bit extra road there 's fifty thousand dollars left over but we didn 't do the extra road i know we 're doing other work down there but i thought if you get what i mean like we need to know the expenditure on this how much we 've been spending that 's why i support andrew 's recommendation there but i still like to throw it out to the councils do you want to consider instead of double work put the spilling point up of say six metres set back by three meters while he 's doing the work because i i think eventually you shouldn 't have the trucks going into the wreck round to fill up that the thing and i did have a win on last thursday week i spoke to the lady from and i said there 's a green box hindering your design she said yes it is she said gary said it can be moved more money if you remove that green box more money but all all i 'm saying is that we could should consider this setback point for the thing while we 're actually building the fence it might cost us an extra thousand dollars but okay so this needed to be added to the amendment or this can be taken through the chair i 'm happy for that to be taken in because it will be an additional expense because that will lead to additional fencing that 's required um the second thing is is it it 's not staff 's intention not to expend grant monies in the in the way that they 've been intended to to do that which is why we we have indicated this to start with the the contracted monies had been provided to council as part of this council was aware that there was going to be a short fall wind in this fence being completed and this is the to be a anything other than that which is why i 'm more than happy to give a reconciliation because we need to do that as part of the project anyway we do that as part of this process so that 's why i 've got no problem in providing that to council moving forward okay so do you feel it i mean it 's councilman kevin 's motion and council mccarthy 's second but that is a point six needs to go in there would you consider that andrew the point six yeah i i i i 'd consider it um i i wonder if it 's appropriate if we could have a comment from the director of technical services um because i 'd just like to hear his view on that because i i 'm i think i understand what you mean i think you 've spoken to to chris about it so he should make a comment on it uh yeah through the chair thanks um councilman mckinnon um yeah look certainly with regard to uh the expenditure date to date uh look we have really got the funding uh hence why i 'm i suppose put a report to ward council in regard to the sixteen and a half thousand rick to complete the uh 75 meters that 's required uh again i have furnished uh a bit of a report there this morning uh for the general manager 's consideration regarding the uh acquittal or the reconciliation of costs so a number of things there where council mccarthy 's also raised the issue of posts for lindelgrain discussion has been had with the fencing contractor in terms of you know protecting our fencing asset and having a uh an off-take for lindell green as a provision and at the end of the day regarding the protection of the fence asset it 's uh recommended that council consider its position regarding the uh application of the oil spray uh for longevity of the fence so a number of factors uh in that and and and recognizing councilman gibbons point where uh not just 200 meters but 275 meters would certainly equate to uh just a little bit more of a margin of cost of ran about additional costs that certainly would need to be considered by council in relation to taking from uh potentially open space uh contributions thanks madam man the on the offset fencing chris i think um councilman 's asking about the offset fencing and the and where a potential standpoint could locate in accordance with councillor mccarthy 's suggestion yep again thanks uh madame um yeah counselor mccarthy certainly taking on board your uh uh your uh request certainly that can be taken into account without i suppose a you know full-blown master plan as such um the positioning of that um is not known but certainly can be provided for now whilst that fence material would be ordered if council was to proceed would take up to eight weeks uh along with another order that 's already a customer order is already current uh i believe we would be taking a you know stock of that material within eight weeks and you know within that week period eight week period we would uh certainly discuss that with fencing contractor about a location for uh you know the future filling point uh from the uh bakersfield uh big bigger school road for uh filling up watercolors and like i think what i meant can i just clarify to the director the setback are you suggesting that that will be the post and rail fence the same as the other things for the chair um yeah certainly that would be a continuance of post and rail not unlike the inset for the uh access to the o 'connell sport wrecked ground uh we could do a an insert of the fence um to allow i suppose for a a pull-off area so say for you know trucks or in all you know clients to be able to fill from an overhead or or some sort of water filling uh dispensing facility adjacent to the biggest field road thanks madame thank you councilwoman kevin unmuted am i thank you madam man i 'm i 'm still a little bit um confused because if we 've got to order the fencing now because it 's got an eight-week lead time we actually need to know whether we 're going to have this um further indent um so we actually need to make a decision now to order to have actually more than 16 and a half thousand say for instance we 've got four more panels um because um otherwise we 'll be at the end of eight weeks we 'll have decide the the technical services director will come back with the cost of doing this then he 'll suddenly say we need eight more panels and we 'll have to go off and order eight more panels at that stage um i 'm just not quite clear as to how it 's the director of technical services is suggesting this should be handled um noting this uh this issue and also i 'd also like to know this protective coating how often should do we have to apply it should we be applying it in another four years because i 'm i 'm sure the um and i don 't know whether the air cottle community group would be prepared to do the follow-up maintenance on you know every four years applying the coach through the chair very good questions but that 's will provide for council i 'm given i think that that 's a very good point that you 're right he 's like um look i 've had a i 've had a conversation with the with the um fencing contractor who 's indicated that the protective coating is a good way to to issue longevity but it will require to be reissued after a point in time so it will have to be included as part of our whole of life costs in regards to in regards to whether council wants to put an infill point at this point in time to as a as a preferred option for uh water to be to be sourced cancel the cubans absolutely correct like the last thing you want to do is do something like or not do something like that and then have to come back and retrofit it or pull it out and do that again so if cancel are of an opinion that they want us to do that i 'd suggest a 6 that allows us to bring back a short report to march outlining what the do that um this will still allow us to get on the front foot with ordering the fence but then give you a more of an understanding on what on on what that would look like that 's forgiveness yeah through the chair just clarify a couple of things with council mccarthy so you have a straight fence lying along beacon swirl road then you 're going to have to recess in to get into the ground because the fence would be too close to the bitsman road so that 's where you 'd like to extend the fence so they 'd fill up on in the laneway on beaconsfield road rather than in the ground [Music] that 's correct but my opinion was that you go south of the gateway so that yeah it could decide distance rides from the rms requirements in other words as you come down you don 't hinder that but reason why i thought we should consider it now because going by the reports that we get from council how much is it going to cost you to get a road from the gates down there working why aren 't we looking at having a set back provided now it still doesn 't give you a standpoint like that but it 's something for the future but that that 's all i was getting at we 've got the chat working there you have this set point which is big enough to get a a car and a trailer or a small truck off to a filling point that was come in the future so i see the filling point has been back towards black springs from the existing gateway so you 're going to have two recesses one to get into the ground and then another one to get in the field not not only there 's one into the ground at the moment isn 't it well that wasn 't the chair there is there is yes it 's done yep yep it 's done yes so you you 're creating another one up here no no it 's not you 've got the existing one here into the ground yeah it 's like just like that fence still stays yeah so 't have a gate that 's costed in here no it 's not the first recess into the greenhouse first in the advantage so you want another recess up in the back springs in to provide a filling two recesses in 170 150 700 metres well you understand now and then it costs the polly pipe to run it over there to standpoint through the chair i don 't think council mccarthy is recommending that we move the current location it 'll come as part of the development of the o 'connell recreational master plan i think what council mccarthy is requesting is that council look at putting a second recess that could accommodate a down pipe in the future rather than [Music] retrofitting an existing fence that 's a good idea yeah so we would need a then 8.6 and about a thousand dollars think it should come back yeah we need to know exactly what that is through the chair i 'd really like to bring it back to council so as we 're all on the same page before we get that fight so council mccarthy can andrew mr councilman mckinnon and i also can 't see councillor kellum on the screen i 'm not sure whether the council killer may want to speak to this thank you madam mayor i wasn 't you wanted to speak to it or not i couldn 't see you i i would like to say a couple of things uh i think that the points raised by council mccarthy and councilman kevin are quite valid uh what i 'm disappointed by is the fact that even though these points have been discussed with council staff none of it appears in the business paper and i find this business payment efficient i support the amendments uh as they exist and would expect to see a proper business paper which gives all counsellors all the information available to make a a reasoned decision at the march ordinary meeting are you saying that you think the amendment should have been in the in the business paper council no matter mayor i 'm saying the information should have been in the business paper it could reasonably be expected it would be raised because two and so we 're we 're trying to make this on the run um i do agree with the amendments that are there but you know that 's information that should have been reasonably foreseen in putting together this business paper and it shows that efficiency in the ability uh to write a cogent paper that counselors can read beforehand with all the available information and make a proper decision and i thank councilman cuban and council mccarthy for raising the issues that they were aware of thank you for your comments so response to that i 'm i i 'm happy to respond to it through the chair um this process has been aligned to a number of council resolutions and count and this process certainly um was provided to to follow those the only reason that this application has been put into this business paper is through the um advice from a contractor that says if council was able to make a decision in this instance the the lag time could be substantially reduced if council are of the opinion that this needs to be re-dealt with at this project put the report to council with the information that 's been provided and added however it may mean that the lag times grow to to an extended period okay counsellors council mccarthy we need a point six here that we need to i just don 't know whether andrew would consider installing the 0.6 of council consider the fuel point um south of the existing gateway and i take on board the general manager 's comment that there was a proviso possibly if we put the order up we might have got this material in four weeks but i said i had input into this it didn 't come back in in the paper anyway i 'm just a bit disappointed too just like mark okay so we have a point six so and councilman kevin are you happy with point six um thank you madame i am happy with point six the only issue that concerns me is if we need four extra panels it 's probably gonna cost us four thousand three hundred and forty dollars are we then going to make an order for that be ordering it now and that 'll be a further installment and we won 't be tagging it on to the end of another order which is i understand the opportunity we have now and that 's why we 're looking at this 16 and a half thousand dollar proposal for the additional 75 meters that 's my concern we suddenly have this um orphan order coming out of the march meeting for say four panels to allow for this ingress um i 'm not sure how we handle that unless we increase the sixteen and half thousand to a figure say twenty thousand five hundred um subject to point six below being investigated by the director of technical services i 'd ask the general manager how he intends to handle that um i think and on the comments made by deputy matt callum i think i alluded to all those issues when i raised this amendment and the necessity i also did suggest to the technical services director that he might like to circulate a resolution today sorry a reconciliation today to all councillors to look at so we 't receive that and i appreciate the time was probably short um but that 's my question to the to the general manager and the technical services director i support the addition of six but will that then create an orphan order at the end of march for say four additional panic panels to allow for this inlet um that will then be hard to tag on for another order and we have to get another budget amount for that because in my quick calculation of its four panels it 's going to cost us 4 341.58 um with the council 's indulgence i agree and wasn 't aware that there was an in put being proposed however in saying that if we made a provision in condition one that says up to 21 000 which would cover the four and a half but remembering it 's up to rather than a number that that gives the technical service director an opportunity to go back to the to receive a an amended quote to allow for that indent i 'm noting that it 'll be over and therefore there 'll in order to to do the thing that you 've said rather than having a orphan quote of four panels how 's radoni thank you madame um i appreciate the diligence with which uh councillor mckibben and councillor kellum uh wish to put forward this motion um against that i also see that a council has been acting in a way it always does uh i 've spoke to the director about the the caps a bit of a discussion there um council mckibben spoke about the ingress about council mccarthy spoke about the ingress and councillor mckibben spoke about reconciliations um i don 't i don 't see those pressures as necessarily criticisms as long as we 're at the end of the game we have the rigorous information in front of us now i did mention to councillor mckibben i believe yesterday that we could use plastic or tin cups and i 'm glad he suggested we use gold caps i think i i thought that would be uh rather nice but if if the councillors are suggesting that this is expensive and then keep adding thousands to caps back into that funding amount as well just to make that point um madame i um i 'm happy really with council to either add six so we can get that order in because i think that 's sensible and trust that the all the other details of that motion will be provided by the director of technical services and and we will have an accurate and due process accounting of the funds before us i i don 't think we need to worry about this as much as we are as well okay counselors i 'm going to put this amendment now in six parts you all have it in front of you point one has now been changed to say up to 21 000 xgst to take up this egress i 'm going to put the record i 'm going to put the amendment all information out of me i think councilman callum wants to talk counselor callum are you indicating you wish to speak still madam mayor i don 't have the amendment in front of me okay you want me to read it out for thank you can you indicate when you 're already councillor kellum players i 've got it come out of me okay counselors i 'm going to put that amendment in six parts all in favor council kellum are you in favor i 've got my hand up madam mayor you weren 't on my screen thank you councillors the amendment 's carried the moment now becomes the nation all in favor of the motion carried unanimously thank you item 0503 stp steering committee update there 's a recommendation that council confirm its position in relation to the scope of the series treatment plant project as only the sewerage treatment plant and not the initially included east oberon reticulation component and the council reaffirmed its request to retain all of the restart funding allocation and overplays councilman kevin and councillor callum thank you councilman kevin you wish to speak to me thank you about a man um so what has happened broadly to councillors who are not on the stp steering committee is that the government although we went to the government seeking to say we would deal with the east a bands but may may not be proceeding and what was the attitude of the government if we did not proceed would we keep those ground funds the government has basically indicated to council staff and to um gary styles that basically they want a decision from council in relation to the east oberon before they will make a decision in relation to going ahead and for further grant funding so it 's a bit like a catch-22 situation that has arisen so the sap steering committee considered this in detail and it was our view that basically we had no choice but to make the decision now in relation to east oberon and say that we would not be going ahead at this stage um and that we would withdrawing that and then asking the government to reallocate those funds to the stp after us having made that decision there 's obviously no guarantee that the government will reallocate those decisions but if we don 't make this decision now it appears that we 'll be perpetually in limbo in that the government is unlikely to make a decision so on the basis of that of of the position we 've been put we met we we have no alternative i believe in council determining that we will not proceed with the east abroad and advising the government accordingly thank you councillor council kellum thank you madam mayor and council mckibben 's summation is very accurate we must make this decision and and that is confirm our views on east oberon for us to progress and i support the uh the motion thank you councilman any other comments councillors can i say um to proceed uh so i think i don 't i don 't personally have a problem with this we only have one folio out of 50. sorry wasn 't there only one possible failure out of 50 residents one possible failure well we 've done an order i 'm sorry the order of the septic system yeah yes and and was found only that 's correct so doesn 't that give us a pretty good indication that 's yeah that was my point any other comments on this one councilman i 'm putting the recommendation all are no pro-session reports this evening so i 'm going this afternoon so i 'm going to close the meeting at 3 10. thank you councillors and thank you to our community _"

Director of Corporate Services when it 's a Phoenix and we 'll start the presentation thank you you Lynette you 're muted good afternoon everybody this presentation outlines the drive twenty twenty twenty-one operational plan currently on public exhibition some of the assumptions for the drive twenty twenty twenty one operational plan include a forecast total income of approximately twenty six million dollars made up or a rate Peck increase of two point six percent on land rates which is set by the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal an increase in the financial assistance grant Block Grant and block supplementary a significant increase in capital grants based on all works being completed during 2021 in line with double ASP fifteen details of the projects will be discussed later in this presentation a reduction in investment revenue in accordance with the Reserve Bank of Australia forecast and council 's investment policy we are also forecasting after council sets there 's the reduction in road maintenance means that council will need to find other works funding sources any adjustment to this area will be reviewed in accordance with use employees salary wages and superannuation are forecast to increase by three point five percent this includes the local government award and performance increases training expenses have been calculated at two point five percent of total salary and wages cost which is standard for local government fees and charges have a 1.3 percent CPI increase unless statutory this draft operational plan will be finalized for the July ordinary council meeting taking into consideration any movement identified such as additional grant funding being announced during the public exhibition period councils planning and development deck director will outline the waist assumptions Thank You Lynette it is proposed under the current draft the council continue to provide the our community before free tips per assessment as well as one free tip day the bulky good collection will continue to be undertaken in the oberon Township area it is also proposed under the current draft the council continued to operate the black in 2020 21 in 2020 122 I thought a planning and construction of a new landfill cell plan to the Oberon waste Depot councils Technical Service the director will now outline the water and sewer assumptions thanks Paul so this year in regard to the sewer fund councils councils plans is to continue with the development of a design of the new sewer treatment plant in preparation for its construction other undertakings in this area include maintenance work involving councils sewer reticulation and infrastructure asset upgrades to its water treatment plan and sewage treatment plant respectively capital works and purchases in the water fund are forecast to include and continue infrastructure renewal and operational performance upgrades to optimise water treatment hub functions councils Corporate Services Director will outline the long term financial plan thanks thank you so some of the assumptions for the long term financial plan include the rates and annual charges castle councils special rate variations ceased in 2019 20 council has used a flat rate of 2.9 percent by Park has been known to drop the rape pegging significantly like it did several years ago when it there is no indication that I part will do this in the immediate future this rate will rip will be reviewed each year in line with the iPod ruling other revenue council has in council is increasing the revenues by nought point oh five percent each year reaching an increase of 1.75 percent in 2020 30 council has increased the projected capital grants in 2223 by 900,000 for the sewer fund on the assumption that iran will receive state or federal federal grant funds to construct the new sewer treatment plant with regards to employee benefits and own costs we have used a 3% increase for each year for salary wages and superannuation for the long-term plan this is representative of the local government award increase and performance increases for staff all materials and contracts such as contractors for roads and cleaning purchase of fuel chemicals utilities and materials for the maintenance of plants buildings cemetery stock parks gardens and grounds library etc each year will increase at one at 0.05 percent reaching once again 1.75 percent in 2020 30 I 've just outlined the future the performance benchmarks the expenditure with operating revenue which we continue to achieve a positive result and anticipate this to continue what we 've forecasted different council 's own source operating revenue for the 2021 due to the amount of external stimulus grant funding it is forecast a return to above the benchmark in 2021 2022 onwards as grant funding is expected to slow the water and sewer asset renewal ratio is to assess the rate at which they ask these assets are being renewed relative to the rate that they are depreciating council continues to maintain the benchmark and forecast to continue the infrastructure backlog ratio shows what proportion on the infrastructure backlog is against the total value of councils council 's infrastructure Council has met the backlog benchmark with a current level of 1.8% this was achieved by the introduction of the special rate variation and the local infrastructure renewal scheme low-interest loans I 'll now outline income statement comparisons as mentioned previously we are forecasting an increased total income of approximately twenty six million dollars made up are the 2.6 percent rate PEG increase and 1.3 percent CPI increase on annual block supplementary a significant increase in capital grants based on all works being completed during twenty twenty twenty-one in line with double ASB fifteen this increase in capital grants will be explained shortly a reduction in investment revenue in accordance with the Reserve Bank of Australia forecast as well as the fees and charges are forecast to reduce slightly in twenty twenty twenty-one predominately due to the increase in RMS order ordered works on reviewing the draft 2021 operational plan placed on public exhibition it has come to our attention that we overlooked three items in the draft 2021 income statement the draft 2021 operational plan is correct with a forecast deficit of forty seven thousand two hundred and sixty seven with all income and expenditure included throughout the document the errors were made in the transfer of data from the draft operational plan to the draft income statement to ensure more transparency the figures in other expenses have been increased to include expenses that in the past have typically been included in materials and contractors such as operating leases debt recovery legal costs and audit this accounts for an thousand for the proposed twenty 2021 however the materials and contracts have not moved by this amount as there has been a decrease in army expenses and the block grants have increased council was endeavoring to show the insurance rebates and an insurance rebate of thirty five thousand seven hundred and fifteen was not shown in the list of other expenses on the original document the total expenses equal fourteen million nine hundred and eight thousand eight hundred ninety five dollars which did not show up the amount of eleven million one hundred and fifty six thousand eight hundred and forty two should they should be on the line below as it is operating result before disposal of assets and carry and carry Oliver 's during the development of the draft twenty twenty twenty one operational plan staff identified savings in other expenses with efficiencies in items such as administration consultants debt recovery and subscriptions to the value of approximately seventy six thousand dollars staff will provide a comprehensive comparison table as part of the July report to Council to explain the budget movements from 2019 to 2020 this slide before disposal of carry overs and before capital hour as a result of the substantial capital projects anticipated in twenty twenty twenty-one there is a forecast decrease in net gains from disposal of assets as most projects have been completed in 2019 2020 financial year we are forecasting minor carry auditors the increase in transfers from restricted relates predominantly to the sewer treatment plant Council is looking at one off at a one-off adjustment to address the changes that will affect the 2018-19 balance sheet in relation to the changes to the Accounting Standards double ASP 15 and double a SB 1050 eight as well as changes to the list recognition under double v16 where necessary these will be addressed during the financial year end and will be available for viewing following audit counsels technical services director will now outline the projects plans during twenty twenty twenty-one thanks Lynette yes during

path back to Winnetka so connect before the draft statement of revenue thank you so for the road in year 2020 21 Council has adopted a rating structure which in complying with the Local Government Act 1993 maintains the equities of the present structure this chart shows the different rating categories that make up the total rating revenue and how they contribute to the total revenue collected so you can see here that farmland contribute forty seven three percent rural residential contributes 16.5% non-urban provide 4.0 five percent and business contribute nine point one nine percent making up the total revenue contributions if should also be noted that with an average increase of 2.6 percent there will be assessments that have a higher than expected increase these will be as a result of the land value changes through the supplementary listings that is land transfers and revaluation of land values from the general value ageneral whilst putting together their draft to any 2021 operational plan staff looked for efficiencies as well as other savings such as no rate PEG increase on general rates and town improvement levy for 2021 this was not used as it would not only see an increased deficit but all other considerations in operational plan in the operational plan need to remain the same to provide our community with the same standard of services and facilities in accordance with state government amended regulation any increase not included in 2020 21 operational plan can be recovered within the next 10 years we also looked at a reduced increase in general rates in town improvement used as it would see an increased deficit once again all other considerations in operational plan need to remain the same to provide our community with the same standard of services and facilities in accordance with the state government amended regulation any increase not included in 2021 operational plan can be recovered within the next 10 years the iveron mayor and councillors are currently seven point seven one percent behind the maximum remuneration allowed by the tribunal the draft 2020 21 operational plan currently includes a 2.5 percent increase to the mayor and council of fees which would be a total increase of 2800 across all councillors investment interest forecast is very conservative in accordance with the reserve bank of the of Australia forecast and over to the deputy mayor who will now discuss possible covert 19 effects you code nodding was a difficult issue to deal with earlier this year and it has cost council a total of about seventy four thousand dollars since the beginning of march the next financial year and the effect of komen is unpredictable and so prudent allocation of funds to that to cope dollars now that may or may not be enough and we will be updating that at each quarterly budget review but I think it is a prudent figure to put in as a provision and prospect to the mare to speak about the vision and mission statements thank you in 2018 council began consulting with the community to formulate a new strategic plan which was then adopted in addition and mission statements were put together by the community and endorsed by council we are now looking towards 2021 and beyond and noting that the CSP is a living document counseling during that perhaps we need to revisit the vision commitments to reflect a change in society so we once again asked the community impulse a vision statement depicts where we want to be in the future our aspirations and our direction the New South Wales Government through the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal set the allowable Raider entry increase councils but it d1 designated increase has been set at 2.6 percent forever on this means in increasing revenue of a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars it is interesting to consider and are forecast to rise by a similar or greater amount utility and other external costs have been forecast to rise by the CPI which for this financial year is 1.3 percent councils general fees and charges are also proposed to increase by 1.3 percent water and sewer rates are proposed to increase by one 31.3% also this ensures these areas of council operations are sustainable all monies collected through these rates goes directly into the water and sewer funds to ensure plant and deputy levels through these rates are maintained cognizant of the difficulties experienced by the community over recent time through drought fire and Cobert ways to assist and support over on residents one possibility is the option rate relief for the coming financial year one way to achieve this could claim all or part of the recommended 2.6 rate increase or not pass on the 1.3 percent increase in fees and charges unfortunately there are ramifications no matter what option for rate relief if any is decided on services still have to be delivered to an acceptable level staffing levels need to made to be and maintained the office of local government has advised that as a one-off scenario foregone rates can be recouped by adding the foregone percentage to future increases is this ideal maybe not a bit like buy now pay later awesome may be supported that the designated increase be applied please read the options put forward for consideration by staff in the operational plan and delivery program that they 'll be discussing here today and on which are on current currently still on exhibition these documents can be viewed online hard copies are available at council admin and at the library your feedback is greatly appreciated I will now pass on to the general manager Gary Wallace Thank You Madame mayor my wrap-up is the final part of this presentation and it looking at the where to from here at the June ordinary meeting council resolved to place the current draft on exhibition that is the plans that has just been discussed and and provided to the community today further to that resolution however council has requested that staff look at potential savings of up to one hundred and sixty six thousand dollars the 2021 period a further stipulation on that has been placed on staff as savings are not to include the current Rhodes budget further constraining this resolution is that water and sewer funds cannot be considered at this time because they 're self-sustaining this in effect minimizes the request to look at service levels within the general fund this could have impact on some of the proposed programs surprised with in this draft I 'm staff will be providing information to counsel in this regard during the July ordinary meeting as in the mirror is indicated this consult consultation process is not ideal however we continue to seek the support and engagement with afternoon submissions can be provided to Council up until the 13th of July 2020 and I encourage the community to lodge their submission in relation to the draft I 'm sure you wish to speak to anyone in the inner relating to this plan police contact them through the website we through the email address highlighted on the screen or contact them or contact us on six three two nine eight one double zero thank you for ongoing involvement in this process and wish you well thank you very much _"

have just joined us you will be able to see your three presenters pinned at the in the speaker view uh nick scott and mark will be your presenters tonight nick if you 'd just like to do that little bit of housekeeping again for those that have just come in yeah thanks for joining us all um under normal circumstance we would have loved to have done this face-to-face but unfortunately the world we live in we 're going to do it a little differently so the hell we 're going to run tonight is the two directors one being scott wander who 's recreation and cultural director and mark hodges is director of development services they 'll give short presentations around what their roles in this project are and what their functions are scott is managing the project um from the uh construction perspective and mark is the director of development so part of this so everyone will be on mute except myself and the two directors as the we go ahead they 'll do their short presentations and then you can use the chat function to ask questions and then i 'll put those questions to the two directors so we hope to hope to get through this in about an hour we have sort of 30 odd people in the meeting now so we 'll try to get through in an hour see how we go so we might start with you mark if you 're ready to go okay apologies i 've got a powerpoint presentation but i can 't get it across on the ipad from the computer and the computer doesn 't work all of a sudden but uh so i might just verbally do it we can potentially get this up in a tick but um let 's talk about what application is before council right at this point in time so it 's an application for for the overall concept approval or a concept designed for the uh the sporting um the bloomfield sporting precinct of view a concept approval it means what used to be called probably more more in uh general terms a stage development so in the total span of what a development might look like it 's and it 's appropriate to do it this way is now to give people an overview what what the end product will look like in concept so that 's firstly the part of the application before council this the more detailed part because that 'll then break it up into three stages stage one is also what they 're they 're seeking approval for the applicant is both work earthworks tree clearing uh building demolition minor buildings around the site and also some remediation of some soil that 's in one of the tee offs so that 's that 's the technical or the detailed application that has been sought in this application as well as the overall general concept stage two and three is the next part of the of the development process would be the subject of separate of separate applications and so they will come into the future once those details and design those matters and then bring them back for another with another application for detailed assessment uh same process as this advertising community engagement and referral after government agencies key key dates for you to be aware of so currently the application is on exhibition so public comment is being sought it 's on exhibition until 5 pm on wednesday the 13th of october so that 's key where can you go to to have a look at the documents on council 's website so orange.nsw.gov.a_:_236.2 you look under the section um of the heading of planning news and it will have a list of the all the documents that have been submitted with this application uh it includes things like the architectural plans the statement of environmental effects all the all the um the civil designs to go with that stage one earthworks um the tree studies um landscape master plan which has been developed even the traffic studies and noise assessments so that does give the details of um of the how the whole precinct will will effectively work whilst giving the very fine detail of the part of this approval so um that 's where you can go to find the information have a look at all those documents it 's quite extensive um now let 's talk post exhibition um process so following the 13th of october once the um the the application comes off of exhibition staff then take any submissions that have been received and they forwarded them off to the because this application remains as an integrated development [Music] application same as the previous one it 'll go off to the in this case the new south wales heritage office any submissions that is uh they review the submissions and report back to council 's assessment staff any terms of their approval process so they might put conditions on the on the consent in effect following that our staff will complete their assessment of the proposal and it will then report the provide that reports straight to the western region planning panel so that 's the um the determining authority is not council itself as it does with its normal local development this is with this is the next step up so to the western region planning panel um so um that when that might happen it depends on how how the submissions go how the um the government agencies go reviewing the the the submissions received and when we get the general terms of consent um and then again once the staff have completed their own assessment council itself may choose as a proponent to put a letter of um support or whatever with that that process but that 's a minor part of it the main part is we do the assessment report and um and it goes straight to the planning panel okay so that is about it i might whilst um i 'll hand back to nick and then i 'll try keep trying to um to have a look at my data here if not we 'll put this same detail up on the uh website i 'd imagine uh thanks mark we might go to scott now if you 're alright to go score oh yeah thanks nick i 'll do that mark just the question mate that the planning panel when they do their assessment public hearing in orange if they so choose yeah they certainly do um they 'll be doing a site visit i met with them last week just to to run through the process where they want to go they pretty keen to come up and actually get a good feel of the site so they 'll do that soon and with their um their meetings they are normally uh public meetings um they can determine not to but in this case i 'm of the understanding that would be um the so the process would be where um during that um that meeting the joint regional planning panel meeting or western region planning panel meeting they may invite people to give presentations or allow people to give presentations as well okay thank you so i suppose what i wanted to do was really talk to what we 've been working on uh really since the last time this uh this application was public and that 's really we 've worked with um a company to develop the landscape master plan and in so doing that we 've also developed uh plan so the process we went through with tyler bremer was to develop an initial landscape master plan building on what we 'd already proposed and then we had a meeting with heritage council staff that was quite an extensive meeting went for a good period of time they gave us some feedback we then incorporated that feedback uh into this revised plan and then we presented that to what 's called the approvals committee which is the body of heritage that assesses applications to get their feedback so they were also it wasn 't the full committee it was a a sub-committee of of that group um and again they were happy with where we 'd gotten to the to the landscape master plan i suppose this was the pace that brought all the different elements together and gave heritage and the approvals committee and now the public a level of understanding and feel for how the project will look in its final state we 're not yet this plan whilst whilst we think it 's around um 90 um we still need to have some consultation with the 'll do that over the coming weeks and then we 'll finalise the plan and that will go up as a finalised document but this gives everyone an understanding for where we 're at and what we think we 'll end up with so in developing the plan which is public now we ran through all the history about where it 's located we 've also acknowledged of course the aboriginal heritage and the european heritage of the site so that 's included in the plan um we 've looked at how it connects with the city um and all the different access points um it 's very it 's it 's worth noting that the extended uh development of the southern feeder road which you can see on that diagram there on the right uh which has dotted lines and the number five next to it so that provides additional connectivity to the site and also south of the site that road isn 't considered in the traffic management study so that will increase have the access points and egress points to the site so you can see there connections to the site so as i said whilst we know that will happen because it 's not doesn 't exist at the moment it 's not included in the traffic plan we 've also dealt with some visual connections of the site and what we did also was to include some topography so really anyone that 's been out there knows how that site uh changes from its high point near the entrance down to the lower point uh where the existing fields are and why that 's important is uh whilst it 's a gradual slope from south to north um why that is important is because when we 're developing our civil design we need to do what 's called cut and fill so we so we cut from the high point and we fill at the low point to get a level playing surface obviously the impact of that is the ground changes as you do that cut and fill and we balance that across the site but it makes it pretty hard to retain um vegetation that sits within that cut and fill so that of the change in the topography where you can see cut and fill um so particularly down these areas here you can see with the cut these trees are above the ground so they 'd be in mid-air if you were to leave them in place obviously you can 't and similarly on the field side they go far above the base of the existing trees so that just gives you an indication of how we have to manage it across the site with which limits what we can do um a b and c a b and c so top to bottom is how you read that plan a b and c across the page um and then we 've provided some extra indication so how it sits within the precinct so you can see there 's quite a bit of cut this end and then we level out down here so that 's in this zone across there we dealt with how we deal with water surface management how we so the blue lines are surface water the red lines uh a pit and pipe and so how recycle using the existing water up here the overflow from uh from the hospital down south and through these ponds will be underground uh and then so that will get picked up in that network so there 's quite a bit of detail in the civil designs um to deal with that so just an indication of how that will work on the site the layout hasn 't changed so we still have the main stadium in of itself on the western side and the athletics on the east inside with the multi-purpose fields in the middle what has changed a little bit is how we deal with the ingress and egress as that design has developed and so a two-way in and out and then back to town or heading south but it also afforded us an opportunity to do something in front of the existing in the front of the proposed stadium rather so all that details uh obviously included that 's just this um this slide is intended to pick up some significant trays and uh history points the new blah pit some of the elder trees that as well this is the existing trees and what we 're proposing to remove now so the trees in the lighter grain are the ones we 'll keep these ones down the middle will be transplanted um these ones will be protected uh these ones will be moved within the next week or so the truths within the footprints of the two stadiums are the ones that we 've already taken out and then we 're including uh now the trees the long forest road and some of the trees along huntley road and that 's fundamentally because they 're pine trees and they 're not terrific specimens and they will also need a replacement strategy in the near future so whether they stay there or not now at some point they would need to be replaced so part of the replacement strategy is to build on um some of the both the natural uh trees that existed on in this zone beforehand but also to bring in some exotic trees so that brings the color um into the the precinct with when those trees uh lose their legs purpose of this diagram is to show the trees that have been protected and the treatment for those trees and so they 've all been identified and numbered um this is a this is a summary of the process around managing those trees and how we will protect them there 's a 20 odd page document that details that but this is the summary document but you can see predominantly there around the borders and the reason for that is um because as i said with the change in the slope there 's very little opportunity to keep the trees along the site along through the through the proposed development area and obviously along the northern boundary um this one shows you what we 'll end up with so the intent with this was to create a park-like atmosphere around the playing fields that could be used uh by the community when it 's not in active use as a spawning precinct these trees the red ones are the exotic trees and the native trees are basically the balance so you can see those have been introduced into um the 're in clumps uh along here you 've also seen some clumping of trees brought in here so you 'll have whilst there 's a lot of trees there 'll also be a lot of open space the two stadiums will be fenced but the rest of the precinct will be open and available it includes walking trails mating points picks up the orange signers heritage and there 's some nodes here so you can see these dark green dots are all our marker indicators so you could there 'll be lots of navigation around the site pretty sure the next one shows you um so that 's just how we plan on planting and staging so what we can do wine and when we have to procure trees our biggest limiter will be the availability of trees and growing that stock on um this is a plan designed to ensure that when we that we can acquire the required trees when we need to uh and then we can plant them as we work through the through the development this one 's important from showing you the pedestrian lengths the existing site how they will work they 've all been designed around accessible um traversing of the site so while these paths are on tops of batters or run along the bottoms or batters or around they all meet the requirements for uh accessibility and then this this is the pathway obviously that links through to existing um and you can see here we 'll pick up uh different access points so if you were to use this site um other than attending a sporting event you could park in any of these car parks pick up these trails go for a walk around the precinct uh incorporate it in a loop do whatever you do and also access the southern nine hulls of the golf course uh this just gives it we start to get into the detail about how it looks so we start to get to some more imagery around that again all these different points on the on the uh diagram are all picked up in here and what they are and what we 're trying to achieve and how we 're trying to achieve you see a number seven it links to number seven over here obviously so people can work their way through that uh we get into some zoom shots um so this obviously is the main stadium this is the treatment that we 're proposing along uh forest road uh again these are exotic trees a double laneway in and out a nice access point parking zone area here for the buses etc this yellow part here is a concourse out in front of the stadium itself and then obviously access to the stadium similarly oh there 's some sections same as we did before so the top one is across the field so that 's how it would look and forest road across so you can see it 's quite low profile if that 's the street level uh what you see you 've got the two rows of deciduous trays and then you pick up the grandstand um and so it 's quite well sheltered uh and then again uh this is uh from the cross section from uh that car there is on that existing access road through of granary trees etc sympathetic treatment to shelter the visual impact of the development part planting of trees within the car park and also using a product that allows us to green the the car park itself so it 's not a black bitumen it 's something that we 've also included in this document um this one again is the um athletics precinct obviously see the car parking see some of that detail i was talking about of the draining of the of the parking bays those are accessible car parks along there you 've got pathways meeting points there 's informal play areas considered in there those dots are humans to scale so you can get a feel for what the scale is and then obviously connects through to the rest of the precinct and also to bloomfield itself to grab them itself rather again some cross sections so you can see how to look so this one here is across the northern end of the proposal so a natural waterway that 's a meeting point so if you 're looking from here left to right that 's high once they grow obviously and then you 've got the understory uh and places so that people can can recreate outside of the sporting process itself details on planning strategy principles et proposed plants um how they work a lot of these were picked up from studies that we 'd uh done within the precinct certainly some of them even go go back to where we looked at goblin tree creek and replanting that precinct um when that work was done to remove predominantly the pine plantation down there and and replace those uh trees down there to create that environment now the different sources and reference points are in there they publish documents but if anyone wants those we can provide them again it shows what we 're proposing so that 's the main element that we have been working on since um since the last proposal um we haven 't developed the grand stand uh anymore uh other than to have some further meetings with state bodies and federal bodies sporting groups to end the same with the athletics precinct so we 're just refining the inputs say at this point okay thanks scott we might now as i mentioned earlier if you go to the chat function you can start posting questions and then i 'll put them to the directors we 've got one already from melanie mcdonald 's question for scott the tree canopy sizes on the drawings how far down the road is this presume presumably the new plantings are not that large yeah that 's right so they 'll be the mature trees um you won 't have that at start point but we 'll look to be buying advanced stock as i said before one of the limiters is actually the availability of that stock so we 're looking to acquire that and grow that on now so that we can put in as mature stock as we can but that 'll take some time to reach full maturity of course uh subscribe question from melanie saying so 20 years well we can provide the growth profile of of those trees if it 's required and how fast they grow and how many centimeters they grow a year but uh i guess there 'll be some variations too because it 'll be different species but yeah we 'll see what you can find on that absolutely any other questions um please put up the attachments too so you know where to find the da where it 's on exhibition in the chats as well so you should be able to see that nick i might just clarify just because i was flustered of being on a normal computer but i 'm i 'm there now but when i spoke so that this stage is the overall concept as you saw with all those plans it will work so to to do the leveling for those uh the groundworks for those play areas the next two stages the ones i didn 't really talk about which was the easternmost end of it which is the athletics oval um sodium and then car park is the is the following stage that 's stage two and then stage three is the uh western main main stadium so those two are still a bit of a way down the track but it 's the civil from david mallard can you explain the reasons for the significant increase in the number of trees to be removed from the earlier concept plans and given that increase on what basis do you consider the landscape master plan to comply with the heritage council approvals committee condition that it should retain as many existing mature mature trees as possible so that plan was developed in conjunction with heritage so they 've been involved in how it 's been developed uh what its content is and what our approach is so initially heritage asked us to retain the pine trees along forest road and huntley road and in the northwest corner so the original d.a focused on leaving those trees in situ an assessment done by the landscape architect as to the conditions of those those trees um and how long they were likely to live for uh indicated that we could achieve a much greater outcome by what is proposed in the landscape plan so the elements around retaining the significant trees are really the ones along the southern boundary and the ones that are highlighted through the precinct retained certainly the ones across the playing fields are unable to be retained because of that change in slope i 'd talk to but you know at some point those pine trees will die we all know that it won 't be in 50 years time it will most likely be in within five years time and they will need replacing so those trees aren 't staying there uh at some point they 'll perish um they 're in poor condition they 're in bad they 're they 're in bad health so uh you know we ought to replace them now and then we have a precinct that incorporates that uh replacement and grow them on with the rest of the site and create a lovely uh feel to the site that will last for decades or we do it in five years time and have a missing teeth approach so they 're the reasons really around why there 's a change in the tree count um i 'd really encourage people to concentrate on on what we 'll achieve and what the outcome will be from my perspective have a question from leslie smith why has work commenced when still in the planning process uh quite certainly there was an approval obtained for the works that were conducted on site i 've got a question around can we post this recording on the your say site i think we can we 'll have a look at that um from stephen nugent council and urgent will there be a net increase or decrease in trees when all the new plantings are done ah it 's a net increase and that 's documented on those two shapes within a landscape plan if the community inherits this is from western.ryan if the community and heritage council reject the proposal to remove remove the trees is there a plan b [Music] uh so heritage have been involved in this project now for about a year and a half they support the project that 's the sport they support a sports precinct being created on that site what we 've done is address uh some elements that heritage have asked us to address heritage gave us an approval to conduct the works on was having an understanding for what we might achieve in the future so there 's a fair bit of work done around what the grandstands would look like and how they would present to satisfy heritage council requirements for that site so i 'm very confident that that work that 's been produced is will meet the requirement of heritage council uh is that a no is the question that ryan is um i suppose what scott 's saying is that we 've done enough work that we 're confident we can get approval um the the site is crown land so if it 's not a sporting precinct then it 'll be a question for the crown at some point on what they do going forward any other questions i 'm not getting any other questions so nick i 've got a couple that i can see here i have from nick king we have an offset plan to replace the removal of all trees can you read that again please um [Music] lee sorry from nick king do we have an offset plan to replace the removal of is what 's been presented um people will also be aware that we 're proposing um to develop an arboretum on the northern distributor site up on the hill so i 'm sure that we can document an offset plan if required but i 'm pretty comfortable with where we are with what we 're proposing to replace the trees that we 're removing so any other questions you 've got lee that i can 't see on my particular screen for some reason since this day deals with the overall concept is there a place where the public can see an overall budget for the complete project relevant as we wouldn 't be logically changing the land this much unless we were certain the project could be completed for the 25 million has it been confirmed as a feasible budget so we 've developed obviously a costing for this project that hasn 't been finalized yet because the design elements of the grandstands haven 't been finalized yet but we can make that public when it 's when it 's finalized uh if the selection of the designer of us the process used to appoint the designer well multiple candidates invited to submit an application uh so i 'm not sure what that refers to the design for the grandstands uh and the final design for the precinct haven 't been intended yet so the concept design was that intended uh the concept designed for the landscape plan was was not intended it was uh we appointed taylor branham based on their experience with similar sites uh and also refer and also referred that to the heritage council as to um their comfort around who was developing that so that 's how they were appointed uh to develop the landscape plan just just with the questions if you can if people are the one who asked questions if they could send them to me nick redmond and then i can answer them i think we 're getting through some through the lead which is fine are you is that all that you 've got there no i 've got a couple more nick so from how soon before sport can be played on the new fields uh so the that will become available so if we 're able to progress with the civil works it 's about a 12-week exercise to conduct those civil works so as soon as those approvals come through if they do we 'll conduct that work we 've then got about a six six to eight months windows for growing the grass on those fields and making them playable so they 'd be the they 'll be the two fields that will come online uh first then the athletics and then the main stadium i 've only got two more nick i 've got one from neil jones will council provide an opportunity for an on-site consultation with interested community members before the closing date yeah i 'm happy too last one from me could we have an overall indication of the stages to final commissioning and use sorry would we have an overall indication of the stages to final commissioning and use i can give you the development stages so the development stages that we 're proposing obviously is the civil works which will also include some of that piping uh underground preliminary for um that creates the pads if you like for the uh further development we would at the same time be running two tenders for the athletic stadium in the main stadium so part of that work will incorporate the finalising of those designs and then submissions of those das for approval and then again uh when those approvals or if those approvals come through those works would commence so it 'll be um bulk earthworks at the end they 'll obviously those eight multi-purpose fields in the middle start to take form than the athletics and then the main stadium but i 'd imagine that um both athletics and the main stadium will be um being constructed at the same time so this might have been one that came from lee but this is from kate hook so just to confirm if costs aren 't finalized we don 't actually know that the project is feasible so we could be completely changing the land without without being sure the project is deliverable for 25 million are we pretty comfortable with our initial costings for the program and the project uh within the scope of those funding that 's available so are you comfortable with the costing uh one from neil jones undercover restrictions how many people can attend the on-site meeting when we 've when we 've got a date we 'll sort of work out those details but obviously if anything we do out there i 'll have to meet the cable restrictions so we 'll we 'll just have to comply with what we have to comply with i don 't have in front of me about how many content but we 'll sort that out when we when we get a date for the on-site yeah i wouldn 't i thought it would be any less than 20 based on the current restrictions around outdoor gatherings um i 've never had 20 on site when i 've been out there with interest in parties yeah we 'll we 'll deal with that any other questions that you might have lee no that exhausts mine nick i 've got another one from kate hook has crown land being consulted as to how they would like the land to go into more detail scott ah not really we 've consulted with lamp ground lands on on that we 're the crown land manager for the site obviously the project requires a landowner 's consent with the landowner and being crowned land we 've obtained those consent so from a facility they 're happy with what we 're proposing otherwise they wouldn 't have provided the landowner 's consent for the development okay any other questions before we wind up i think that 's it all right thank you of course thank you everyone for attending we 'll um we 'll keep consulting on this as we go there 's a fair bit yet to do on this but we 'll keep you um as engaged as possible as we go forward with the project thanks for your time _"

    "text": "oranges stormwater harvesting system continues to draw interest from across the country built-in operated by Orange City Council the scheme has taken on the challenge of how to capture and make use of water that 's come from an urban landscape when rain falls or a rural environment water soaks it up arch bellick 's and there won 't be run off with a dams and creeks until after that moisture has built up in the soil that 's in sharp contrast with urban settings where most of the rain that falls on hard streets roofs and car parks will flow into gutters and stormwater channels but what about potential pollution water experts wondered if that water could be cleaned up if contamination could be removed so that stormwater could make a contribution to the day-to-day water needs of urban residents Orange City Council 's pioneering search to find answers to those questions grew from the Millennium drought when the level of its main water supply Dan filter record low levels that prompted a search for new water sources and one of the options was storm water harvesting [Music] my coordinator with Orion City Council I 've been with Council for nine years we had a Millenial drought down to 27 percent in 2008 in sumer Park Dam so I 've got quite low and other sources of water to supplement our supply the traditional catchment just wasn 't catching enough water the idea behind storm water harvesting within an urban area is that the paved areas they 're now sealed off so you 're actually getting additional runoff into the creek system when we have rainfall we have run off very quickly because it doesn 't seep into the ground and runoff straight into the stormwater drainage system the one gutters and that 'll get directed into the creeks and into the wetlands when the water runs off the car parks and off the industrial states and there 's going to be some rubbish we have a gross pollutant trap that is taking up the large materials and might have plastic bags or basketballs shopping trolleys and the gross pollute and takes out those feed bits of rubbish weeds in the water because they were chosen specifically to assist that they use the nutrients to grow and we 've used native plants specifically for wetlands the wetlands slow down the flow and in slowing the flow it drops out sediments and cleans up the water a bit contaminants that could be in the water the suspended solids and oil and grease which can come off the roads in an in a nutshell they they clean the water well from this wetland here on cargo road it 'll go down further to another wetland downstream and we 've got we 've got four wetlands in total and we 've got three pump stations which we harvest to to the stormwater harvesting scheme holding down the holding dam is located at the northern part of the city holding down it it 's about two hundred and forty mega litres and then that water can then get transferred to the batch problems with stormwater it can be quite cloudy contain a lot of sediment and what we do is we add this chemical is called a flocculent and what it does is it attaches to the sediment and helps it drop out can pump to swimmer Park Dam in a day is about six and a half milliliters which is about 65% of daily water consumption foreign average annual volume that we can get out of these systems like 1,300 mega litres which is around around a quarter of oranges supply and you 're surprised so it 's quite a significant addition to supply external harvesting scheme has been really rewarding so it 's been really interesting because it was the first of its type in Australia really enjoyed like the water quality so out of it and proving that the system is working that we 're yeah they 're achieving these targets that with water quality targets that were set to be able to transfer water to sooner that 's safe for consumers you _"

    "text": "well today we 're going for a drive around the streets that are typical orange and we 'll have some bad streets we 'll have some good streets and we 'll also have some new but the idea is to give you a factual indication of what is actually happening in our city and we 're coming to one of the one of the busiest roundabouts in town and it was only six months ago this was in shocking condition and it 's been upgraded been hot mixed and it 's a credit to the staff i 'm going to turn into windham street uh which was basically a de facto bypass for many years and so you had a very high usage road with a lot of commercial buildings and it 's done its job fantastically well however it 's it 's day is over and this is in the program in the next 12 months to redo it 's going to be done no ifs buts maybe and a lot of people will appreciate that straight away because it 's it 's a high usage road high probe said it 's a typical road so like for example it could have been done up in the last three or four or five years the road straight ahead going to clifton grove uh it 's it 's in the budget and also in the planning to be upgraded from here out we 're now in the bypass we 've got sections here which was done in recent times and as you can see this has got to be redone it 's not a case of the foundations being a problem it 's only the the top section and that will be done in the next six to twelve months in our program fully funded planned we 're now onto the hot mix from basically in front of our major new subdivision here industrial estate we are now into the new section which has been laid in the last six months coming onto the major roundabout in front of bunnings on our right hand side is the clergy road which with funding 50 funding we will be able to upgrade uh it 's certainly a challenge uh it 's certainly but it is in the plan again to be done not maybe funded fully funded and planned and it 'll happen in this next 12 months i think the numbers in the northern bypass now is upwards of eight to ten thousand a day enormous amounts of heavy trucks that have come out of the main street this was one of the worst sections of the bypass it 's now super quiet holding up to the conditions and we expect it to be there for many years um we 're now leading down to what used to be road or um the barrandong way now this is sort of an original bit of road that 's been done a number of years ago and we will be doing this section this road is as good a road as you 'll find anywhere it 's um well constructed it 's it 's it 's hasn 't got a blemish and i think this is what everybody would be keen to have at least as good as this or even better we 're coming back into town now we 've got a of the original roads it will be um done in this program as well and they said the roundabout 's been done up in hot mix so that 's fine now we 've got a section here which is the same as the other side and it 's got quite a bit of patching and it 's going to be upgraded we 'll turn left here and go down dalton street you know this is the typical orange road great road within the city it 's a community in the residential area no trouble at all where we 're going to turn into bean street where the road is has to be done but uh people might see and it 's you know pretty common sense when you think about it there 's a major upgrade in in regards to guantanamo and it 's a bit silly to do this right now and then get it ripped up so we 've basically tried to make it it 's a bit of a patchwork but the fact is people be patient and drive to the conditions that block will be fixed going around saying everything 's perfect but what we 're trying to point out is that the roads are being updated we 're a far better position we were 12 months ago we spent we had a budget of 7 million we got to 8.3 million last year the budget now is 15 million but money is not everything it 's got to be done right in in a good a good fashion and like for example this section here in front of the services club templars mill the hotel this was left in a very ordinary condition for a couple years while they did their extensions and now it 's absolutely magnificent the positive decision of all councillors and the staff to hot mix the majority of road system in orange in the in the business area is paying huge dividends if anybody in the community would like to know a bit more about the roads or what the program is if you get on the website of orange city council and it 's all documented there people will be absolutely amazed the biggest problem is with road works road and it gets fixed it 's only six months and you forget about it of how bad it was in orange they certainly mean major improvements now they could always be better but the fact is that there is a plan and the staff are working on it with the support of our councillors in encouragement and also i think majority of our community the main thing is to be positive it should be looked at you know whether it 's sort of half full rather than half empty and i think we 've got the formula glenn taylor our chairman of works in two years has been able to steer the council in regards to that committee to being convinced the council that um we could we spend more money but do a better job and i think we 've i think we 've got uh the results so far and then at the end of this 12 months so i think everybody will be extremely happy _"

    "text": "[Music] hello welcome to the youth week in parks 2021 and i 'd like to start by introducing myself as ken kooth the mayor of park shire and also acknowledging country and i pay my respects to elders past present and future and pay my respects to any indigenous people who might be here today and take their message of respecting the land we walk on and respecting one another is a very important thing for young people to remember when they go around in in this world but it 's my pleasure on behalf of the parkshire council just to welcome everyone here today it 's lovely to see a few people here and i believe a few more are booked in so hopefully that the numbers will swell as the afternoon goes on but thanks for coming and being part of it because you never know what you 're going to learn any day of your life and being involved in things and the lungi the earlier you learn some of those life lessons that the better off you are i thought like most people that are young tell their parents all they need to know but as you grow older you realize that perhaps your parents did know a lot more than you thought they did at that stage of your life so but you never know what opportunities will come forward if you it 's attending these sorts of things you might just pick up a few skills that will enable you to get a job or enable you to reach out to other new friends and it 's amazing what happens just by turning up and attending various functions way back at the beginning of my local government career i was a young person i joined council when i was only 28 years old and people thought what 's a young person like that doing on council but also late a bit to contribute at the time and a young voice on council and it 's great to have you coming out and i got involved simply because i was involved in a bit of a committee around town and somebody said why don 't you stand for council and that 's how it all here still enjoying council and doing things but it all started when i was a fairly young person in relative terms so you never know what might come of turning up to a day like this you might get inspired to do something within your community and volunteering in our community is just so important and it 's great to see youth taking an active role there 's not the organisational things that used to be in our town we used to have a rotor club and a leo club and a say group social activities for youth groups so you had all these young groups of people who go and join and do things for their community and volunteer and get that feeling of being really part of a community that you can embrace and enjoy being being there so they 're not there these days so you 've really got to step out of your box a little bit and go and attend things like today pick up some skills meet other people and enjoy what you could do and see what you might be able to do that famous saying no it 's not what this country can do for you but what you can do for your country and i think the same applies to youth in our town don 't ask what this town can do for you but ask what you can do for this town and so if you take that philosophy into life i think you 'll do very well so on behalf of uh the council could i just thank the guest speakers we 've got joanna here who 'll be one of the early ones up and mel certa they will lead you through some of their experience and big thanks to pat cones up the back uh she 'll also be having a bit of a chat to you and just a wonderful little success story that 's happening by young people that have taken a chance to go out on their own and do something a little bit different so welcome today and please enjoy the afternoon i trust you get something out of it i 'm going to do some road safety talking to you today and want you to have something interactive and fun to do so we 've got two activities around what impaired what why driving is important i guess and and the higher level skills that you need um and why being impaired when you 're driving two interactive activities for us to do but first i wanted to just start by talking to you about the skills that you need for driving and this is where i 've got the lego because i thought it would be the easiest way to explain it to you so when you 're getting your license the first level of skill that you learn is car control skills so this is your ability to steer and change gears and put the lights on high beam and then put them back down and turn your windscreen wipers on right the next level of skill that you will learn and they do interact which is why they stick together like lego so the next level of skill is called traffic skills so this is your ability to understand the road rules put them into place when you 're that sort of interacting and driving around the road the high level skill which is the third one and this is comes last and it 's probably the most important of the three is your low-risk driving tactics and skills so this is your ability to scan and look for hazards it 's your ability to be able to have a plan in place in your head about what you might do if there 's a kangaroo on the road and then being able to put that plan in place it 's about having a three second gap to the car in front of you it 's about being a a good driver and driving to conditions and people say that a lot and what does that actually mean yes it 's about your speed it 's you know looking at what the weather 's doing looking at what the traffic 's doing um and picking and what the road environment 's like and then picking what the best speed is to to drive at so just because it 's 100 k 's an hour doesn 't always mean that how those three levels fit together now when we do these two activities in a minute and one 's around distractions and the other one is around drugs and alcohol what you 'll find is you lose these top two levels of your driving skills and you fall back to base car control skills and your ability to drive comes back to pretty much just keeping your car on the road in a straight line so steering and you lose this ability to judge safe gaps in traffic and and whatnot so let 's get into the fun stuff that 's the little bit of putting in context for you about what we 're going to do so first activity is called are we there yet and it was developed by youth safe and it 's around distractions in the car so i need to volunteer to be our driver [Music] oh and here 's some extra people turning up that 's great no you don 't want to turn up and be the driver all right oh yes excellent a volunteer to be the driver [Music] all right okay yeah so i 'm going to introduce a whole lot of activities for you to do that are going to correlate back to those three basic control skills so this first one i want you to just keep it a nice tempo like that so this is simulating that car controls anything you have to do with your hand skill okay now i need a passenger to get in the car with our driver who wants to be a passenger i love that you volunteer and your friend because you can be a passenger in a minute too i 'll try my best all right okay so you get to talk to our passenger oh yeah yay so i 've got some pre-determined that i wrote down so just whenever you feel like talking to her you talk to us and then you answer whatever he 's asking all right and i 'm still gone not just yet i 'm really trying to get here i 'm just trying to concentrate um let me just go for a moment lovely you could be a great tempo all right so now break okay so i 've just given you an accelera um back to all right accelerator break obviously green is go ready to stop um i might get the mirror to do this you can be the traffic light just flip that whenever you feel like so i need you to put your foot on the accelerator because you 're going and then whenever you see a wonderful mirror flip it over stop and we 'll be watching how you 're going as this distraction keeps happening all day and [Music] [Applause] you 're keeping a lovely tempo [Music] behind us okay and millie over here is going to be our um road signs so when you see her hold one of these up i just want you to say out loud what it is because we obviously can 't see that you 've seen it but we 'll be able to hear that you 've seen it all right just get going and i 'll give you this second lot of questions yes let me just put it on for you just a second [Music] did you see that okay i 'll wrap it up let 's get some feedback from the group how did you how do we think you went i feel like i 've been rehearsing quite a while i don 't think it was fair that i got the tap because i get these questions thrown at me we 've got five boys [Laughter] um how do you think you went in terms of performance um not great i know that there was one second there when the animals showed up but the green sign was still on but i i was like stopped but the green was still on and then i would take off again and then roadwork showed up and i was stopping but the green was still going so i was like what am i doing here and then i need to go to the toilet yeah this is very overwhelming in a situation like that yeah and look obviously it 's just a scenario that we 're doing in here but when you get out in the car that 's what 's actually happening yeah but it probably doesn 't 's really it 's hard to try and tune out the um the talking and a lot of the time it will get louder and the more you tune out the louder it will get so you 've got to sort of just give those really vague answers and and what do you think would have happened if i 'd thrown a mobile phone and call in the middle of all that um yeah oh no worries but you did good great thank you and you guys came back thank you do all our helpers i wish i could practice for you no it 's better that you come to a drawer no you can 't have a cup of tea um yeah any comments from the group about how you found that yeah so like i said basic we went back to basic car control skills during that because it got a bit hectic there was lots of distraction going on in the car and lots of stuff i was asking to do so we went back to basically just keeping that trying to keep the tempo going um a mobile phone call in the middle of all that i 'm pretty sure that the performance would have deteriorated so um i just want you to have a look at this video which talks about your awareness this is an awareness test how many passes does the team in white make the answer is thirteen but did you see the moonwalking bear so the point is when you 're on your mobile phone and you 're driving your car control skills have gone back to that base level of car control so you haven 't got your scanning going and your high risk driving strategies you just focused on keeping the car going in a straight so you do miss things that visual search pattern completely deteriorates when you 're on your phone so that was really easy that was just about a moonwalking bear and none of us saw it on the first pass because we were so busy watching how many passes did the team in white make and most of us got that ride which was great um but this is why mobile phones and cars put it in the boot put don 't have it in the front with you when you 're driving so you 're not distracted by it going off and you 're not tempted to pick it up so it 's currently sitting at a five-dimensional point offense it 's a double demir point offense so in double point periods it 's a ten demerit point um and it can now be picked up by mobile speed camera cars and trailers that we 've got across the network um so that 's mobile phones so the other one i want to do and i might pick some people that didn 't do that last activity is the bee goggles mat so this is about drugs and alcohol obviously and how they impair your ability so um so we 'll do some activities at the mat happy for you to stand up if you want to come and have a look a bit closer at what 's going on um so who would like to go first okay joel will do it excellent all right and i 'm going to give you you 've been drinking and i 'll get you to start up that in where your car keys yep so before we put them on i just i want you to say we 're testing your balance so i want you to walk heel to toe so it 's like this yeah on the road yep yep and then and just imagine that you 're on the road and i 'm going to give you directions oh i need you to pick your car keys up too we 're off to a flying start all right off you go wow okay and i 'd like you to go yep go around the roundabout and take the third exit this is affecting balance okay and you 're at a speed hump so i 'd like you to jump over the speed hump as best you can ah excellent good stuff okay back towards the roundabout yeah yep good work okay i want you to come up this one towards me [Music] houses okay stop when you get to the imr the eye check okay can you read for me bottom line i 've got glasses on [Music] ltc eo did you do the bottom line or the second bottom line the one in the really the bottom bottom line [Music] yep oh close you only got one letter wrong that 's cool all right off go keep going and what are you going to do with that kangaroo that you just ran into drag him off the road poor bugger all right keep going oh good work stopping at a stop sign yes all right kick em awesome and you can head back to where you started put your keys down oh and i kept in one to get back to your car yep all right you can put your keys back take your goggles off how do you think you went very good probably not very good yet your balance was not so great um you did run into the kangaroo in the middle of the road um you went round the round about the wrong way yep um but yeah so that 's high range so that 's the worst you can be in terms of alcohol all right try drug impairment yeah i don 't know what it is it 's just some sort of drug impairment i think they 're worse than the alcohol because you just head on so we 'll do the same thing so you can [Music] yep heel to toe put your head up you don 't need to look at your feet and walk what i can do without looking at my feet yep round the round about take the third exit yeah go the right way yeah and then stop when you get to the eye check and i 'll get you to do the the third line from the bottom third line from the bottom yep they 're dots seriously it 's this one they 're actually dots they 're not dots they 're letters on heels oh this is the drug impairment talking is it e is it there is an a the second one is the second letter is an h no okay so we can all agree that you 're very bad at reading you cannot see the sign yep okay keep going oh my god why the road now but um what would you do if you saw it on the side of the road uh slow down you 're going pretty slow now actually so yeah you did stop at the stop sign so that 's great yep [Music] this is balance that 's being affected right now and you should be able to do it without looking at your feet all right and around around about and head down towards the speed hub oh the wrong way oh there 's big arrows all right you have to jump it nice all right you can dump your keys back in that bloop circle good job how do you think you went trash yeah you really were trash um balance not so great went the wrong way around around about yeah does anybody else want to have a go at the goggles well here no okay so these were they 're just an optical illusion they trick your brain into thinking that you 're under the influence now obviously neither of you are so um but what you could see what it was doing and that reading back at this it 's basic car controls it 's that bottom layer of skills and neither of you could do either of them well you went round the round about the wrong way which is bad if that had happened in real life um so that 's the effect drugs and alcohol and this is why it 's it 's in the road rules under a criminal offence rather than a traffic offence so you now get suspended for a low range drink driving eventually license for three months so if you 're going to drink separate it completely from driving so don 't don 't have a plan to try and drive home particularly if you 're on your p plates where your limit is zero so i should have asked that you guys driving else please yeah to zero yeah cool that 's all i had but yeah hopefully that was informative helpful bit more interactive than just stats no worries thanks again mel and if anyone wants to have a crack at that after um we 're finished yeah we can probably let you have joe treasure she 's 24 years old from cairo a farmer and she 's here to talk about seizing opportunities as well as getting involved with your local community so if everyone can hear us together for joe how old are we all here our younger our younger ones are you guys in like you 're 11 and 12 yeah yep nice okay so hopefully this is all really relevant to you guys um have you guys ever heard the phrase your eight eyes and everything yeah i heard that a lot when i was in year 12. i can tell you right now that i did not believe it for a second everybody said that and then followed it up with but what are you going to do at uni um and so there was a lot of pressure external pressure and a bit of internal pressure which is really unhealthy so when i was in year 12 i had it all figured out i was going to get the highest atar that i could i was going to go to uni and study the most prestigious degree that what it was i had one in mind but i just wanted one that looked good on paper the truth is though that i chose that path because i felt like it was what i should do it wasn 't really what i wanted to do so if you had told me back then that i would be a farmer and a shearer that i never went to uni that i still live in cairo and had never lived anywhere else um that i would have shacked up with a guy that i met in high school i probably would have stopped and said things didn 't really work out for her but the fact is that while i was studying my life away in year 11 and 12 i never once for a second thought about the fact that i was actually miserable um i never once listened to my body telling me that i needed a break i never thought about the fact that i actually didn 't like sitting in a desk all day and studying i liked being outside i liked working with animals i liked life i have now was an option for me back then because i was better than that whatever that even means even now um people say that being a farmer or a shearer is beneath me but i don 't think you guys get told enough that nothing is beneath you if you do if you 're doing what you love and nothing is beneath you if you 're doing it well so i 've kind of made it my mission to prove that you can be successful without going to uni and that 's kind of what i 'm here to share with you today i 'm not saying that going to uni is bad if that 's what you want then that 's awesome but there are other ways that you can go about things that are perfectly fine and you can be really happy if you do that as well so all you have to do is seize the right opportunities and get involved which is my little tagline so the first thing is that you 've got to go out and try different things and eventually 't_''_1625.12 be expected to choose what you want to do with the rest of your life if you 've never tried life outside of high school so if you want to find happiness you really have to go looking for it so how should we make that happen um i tried to think of some practical tips that i wish people had told me back when i was in year 12. so the first one is [Music] a bit of a question so you shouldn 't be asking yourself do i want to do this when an opportunity comes up you should be asking yourself why do i want to do this when you ask yourself that question you 're forced to be honest with yourself and as you get older more and more that 's something you really have to consciously decide to do because unfortunately it 's easier to follow the status quo because growth comes with un discomfort and that 's a little bit harder to handle at first so this question sort of appears later on and i 'm hoping that if you start thinking about ask yourself that question and the better things will get for you so the second one is to add a little bit of mayo to your cv until you don 't need the mayo there anymore so i only speak for agriculture but i know that this would be echoed across all industries there are heaps of scholarships and experiences available which are fully funded by interested parties and there 's not actually as many people applying for them as you might think so you may as well just have a go um in my early applications for scholarships and things when i wanted to apply myself a little bit further than the farm gate i wrote that i was the co-manager of the family business and that i also manage the property that i used to work on they were pretty impressive titles for a 22 year old probably because they weren 't really my titles but that doesn 't really matter because i knew that if someone gave me a go i could deliver you should probably run this by your boss first though because the people in be on board if they know that you want to do something apply yourself to something outside of work don 't be afraid to sell yourself it 's okay to fake it till you make it and i think any successful person will tell you that so i knew that i needed to add a little bit of mayo to my cv back in 2018 so i joined my local squash committee and at the agm the annual meeting i put my hand up for the secretary position the reason i 'm bringing this up is that the secretary position is a really important role in a committee they generally have the highest workload of of most people in a committee structure and people on selection panels know that the secretary will write down all the notes or the minutes from a meeting yep and then they will if they 're let 's say that the kara squash club wanted to reach out to a local business to get some money for a prize they wanted to give out or something the secretary would write that letter the president of make sure that the involved party would get it so number two join a committee even if it 's a local sports group or something low level like that and put your hand up for the secretary position after i after all of this i could tell that i enjoyed the sort of being involved in committees and things like that so i decided to ask one of the bar staff at the services club in town which is crsl how to go about getting on the board at the services club so the squash courts in cara are at the services club so i was up there a fair bit the bus the bar member told me that only eight of nine positions were being filled at the services club at that time so i reached out to the ceo and said i 'd like to go to a meeting and get involved he said he 'd ask the old boys what they thought about me joining the board so you can probably imagine that i didn 't hear anything back for a number of months i heard through the board so i kept pestering them with emails and things like that until they let me go to a meeting and once i got to the meeting i was in either they felt awkward about saying no to me when i was in the flesh or they actually like me it doesn 't matter but then i had director at the carer services club on my cv and i ended up being the first female director that they 'd ever had at the club so that looked good on the cv too and that didn 't require any qualifications all it required was just being a little bit of a pestering yeah a board is kind of like another word for a committee so in an organization a board makes big picture decisions like at the cara services club we recently did a big bistro renovation so we sit back and say will this benefit the club can we afford it and things like that whereas the ceo manages the day-to-day business of the club so number three is to be consistent one of the great side effects of this question is that it can give you a concrete feeling of resolve when you get a setback if you know that what you 're pursuing is important to you if you know that you want something you can have it if you work hard enough so um a couple of years ago i got to go to nepal for foot and mouth disease training i applied for that scholarship four years in a row before i got accepted for it for the first three years every time that the selection panel would write back and say we just want someone with qualifications a vet something like that so every year i 'd look at the criteria i 'd look at the involved parties at what they were looking for and what their values were and every year i tweaked my application until they let me go i ended up spending three weeks in nepal and india and i think i forked out about a thousand dollars for a three-week holiday and it was one of the best experiences of my life the key is just to be persistent so of confidence i 'm starting to feel like i deserve to be in these spaces rather than feeling like a bit of an imposter which is probably how you 'll feel at the start but that 's totally normal so i attended new south wales farmers annual conference in 2019 so new south wales farmers is a state farming organisation so they represent everyday farmers so everyday farmers don 't really have the time to knock on the prime minister 's door and say we want drought assistance so they congregate and take their issues to new south wales farmers who then lobby those issues to the government so they 're really important they kind of stand up for farmers so at annual conference all of the new south wales farmers groups or branches put forward issues that are important to them and then delegates from all over new south wales gather and vote on whether those issues should be lobbied to the government at the start of the whole show you get a big book full of all the issues that are going to be discussed and i had so at the time i wrote down what i thought about it and when that issue was raised i stuck my hand up and said my piece i was really nervous i think there were about 500 people in the room so it was quite daunting and i could feel my voice shaking in the microphone and i thought halfway through my sentence i thought this is rubbish i really shouldn 't have done this when i sat back down everybody in the room clapped just because i had the courage to stand up and say what i thought they all voted against me but it didn 't matter because they 'd see me stand up and speak so later that day i was approached by a kind of higher up in the new south wales farmers organization they encouraged me to apply for a full voting position on one of new south wales farmer 's committees i decided to throw my hat in the ring and i ended up getting a lot of votes and getting voted onto the committee just because people could put a face to the and said something at annual conference it 's probably worth noting that most of the people at these conferences are quite a lot older so number four is having the courage to get up and speak even though it 's easier said than done it 's the kind of thing that gets you noticed even if people disagree with you if that 's a little bit daunting you can start with the mini version of that asking an interesting question at a meeting when you get a bit older or having a difficult or courageous conversation with your boss can be a great place to start since then i 've sat on committees for organizations at a national level which i didn 't get a lot out of but it was still good to learn and that was sort of just from bluffing my way into it and getting on getting on the committees and getting to know people and building a network i got selected for a couple of scholarships and then worked my way up to the selection panel like being on the selection panel for those scholarships about 20 to 25 people applying for these scholarships at any time and out of those people maybe three or four of them had bothered to write more than one sentence even if there were you know 400 or 500 words to utilize so the reason that i sort of raised that with you guys is that if you can be bothered to write more than a sentence and have a look at the selection criteria or what the values of those organizations are you 're almost assuming so you really just need to have a go that 's all it takes especially um getting a referee or someone that you trust to read over the application and give you feedback is a great way to get started too so because of that just having a go mantra i was selected for a couple of leadership scholarships this year after applying unsuccessfully for three years in a row i got selected for the australian rural leadership program or the arlp so it 's one of the more coveted leadership development programs in australia it costs fifty five thousand dollars to me to do it so the first stop is the kimberley in june i 'm not just bringing that up to have a brag i just want to demonstrate that you can get a lot of no 's before you get a yes but that usually makes the yes even more worthwhile so before i wrap this up i hope i 'm not going over time i have business cards here i know you guys might not want to use them straight away but if you decide that you want to go for one of these scholarships please feel free to reach out to me to ask a question about how you should be wording things or what you should be saying or what you should be looking at i 'd love to help any of you guys with any of that if any of you guys are interested in agriculture or learning to share or being aroused about or anything like that i 'd love to help you out too so i thought i 'd just finish with one of my uh favorite ted talks which is by cleo need a bit of motivation it 's called want to change the world start by bringing being brave enough to care in her speech she says the world will say to you what are you going to do don 't be afraid to say i know i can 't do everything but i can do something walk into more rooms saying i 'm here to help we cannot overcome what we ignore when the world asks big questions that require big answers we have two options one to feel so overwhelmed and under qualified we do nothing or two to start with one small act and qualify ourselves thanks joe for sharing that really inspiring story i know i really would have appreciated hearing that when i was in high school so well done to you and everything you 've achieved so our next guest speaker is carly jade who is a local parks woman and she 's going to talk about navigating through life 's challenges so if everyone can put their hands together for carly thank you to parks council for having me along for a very brief 'm born and bred here in parks i 'm here today because i am most passionate about youth i am passionate about what parks has to offer the world in the youth that live here that work here that study here that will also move from here or stay here and i guess for me as well as a psychologist i 'm also passionate about youth wellbeing and mental health so i am going to speak very briefly today through a few key elements that i see um as really important for all of our mental health it 's not for just youth it 's for adults and i guess as well i kind of get i i 'm bugged sometimes when people talk about you know we 're going to treat anxiety and depression or we 're going to overcome this challenge you know what life is really messy and it 's messy from way to go so it 's about how do we actually navigate through those times that really push us and stretch us and make us feel really really uncomfortable um that is what we 're of um the youth week model i guess it 's very much around awareness of mental health words like stress anxiety depression discrimination pulling etc i 'm not going to talk about signs and symptoms today we can all do a very quick google search on those and i do also firmly believe that youth are bombarded with lots of this stuff all the time and perhaps less on what are the practical and really tangible things we can do to actually navigate our way through that for ourselves but also for our mates for our family and for everyone that that we touch at different points um in our journey i guess so we will not be covering a whole lot of those concepts today but what we will be covering is how we actually navigate through whatever the challenge is so a little bit about me um i mentioned i 'm from parks i 'm a mum to two young children who are going to be youth before i know it i was well i like to think i was a youth very recently it probably wasn 't that was um as a young adult um whether there 's significant trauma significant events or not day to day there are many many challenges and i still recall them um myself as a psychologist i am most passionate i think i mentioned about children adolescent mental health so adolescence is an area that i absolutely love working in in a clinical capacity i think when we can get in early and build really fundamentally positive um approaches to how we treat challenges that 's where the money is because then we have adaptive resilient healthy young adults that then move into being adults and influence the next generation so i also i guess um as a mum some of my real concerns and probably something that we didn 't have to face when i was um in my teens is things like the rise of social media i am not going to go into detail on it all i am going to say is it is a highlight reel that is all it is it is so toxic and so dangerous that has lots of benefits so understand the myself every single time i click on the instagram the facebook the snapchat but whatever i 'm opening that this is actually where people are posting their best bits not their worst bits and probably nothing in the middle either so again kind of not going to go into too much detail around it but i just put it out there as a big warning sign to make sure that everyone is aware around it is a highlight reel and to be brutally honest when we 're feeling pretty vulnerable fragile we 've had a rough day social media actually activates and exacerbates some of those feelings because we think we 're missing out we think oh gosh everyone else 's life is so bright and fun and happy and mine really isn 't i 've had that experience i 've worked with lots of adolescents young adults and adults that have had that experience so being mindful of how we 're actually feeling in response to social media is critical and i 'll talk a little bit about that um after i guess um professionally i also work as have seen where you know youth have literally looked as though they were going to destroy their potential in the workplace bounce back in the right role under the right person and absolutely thrive uni tafe traineeship apprenticeship come in as a laborer it works it works when it works so a little bit like what joanna was mentioning just keep fighting for where you want to be keep trying things out it doesn 't matter if you have 11 different jobs in a 12-month period because if you find that one that works and you find the workplace that wants you there it 's where the the magic happens essentially so keep fighting for that it might not be in the first five years after school i have worked with a lot of people at the ceo level who found their feet at 35 at 40. um so there is no defined timeline despite what we may think in our head or what we 're conditioned to our education system to believe the right opportunities are out there so certainly in my role having employed maybe 40 different trainees best ones are not the ones that have got all the degrees on paper they 're the ones that turn up every morning just ahead of time with their uniform on and ready to go ready to actually learn from other people ready to dig in get a good paycheck and go home at the end of the day safely so those those pathways that we talk about are important but they are not everything because there is no pathway for each single person that 's the same so i guess in terms of my very brief model um the first thing i often work with people on is about the ability to adapt so life will inevitably throw a whole lot of challenges our way we know that that 's going to be the case i talk a lot with audiences about my experience my personal experience when i finished year 11 i went on summer holidays it was kind of staring down the barrel of year 12 everything working in my favor and three days after christmas my youngest brother drowned unexpected immediate trauma through everything into chaos was going to look like i 'd won the awards i was top of my class in a few areas i was destined to go to uni all of a sudden the rug was ripped out from underneath and i was like where to next and so that was a literal experience of one foot in front of the other until it somehow makes sense there was lots of anxiety there was lots of sadness there was lots of complicated trauma there was lots of grief it was messy messy to say the least but what we know from that is the ability to adapt to what is happening to you is absolutely critical being able to put one foot in front of the other being able to actually know how you 're feeling about something reach out when needed talk when you can don 't talk if you don 't want to but making sure that you 've got people around you that can help you through those experiences really really important in terms of the ability to adapt one of my first experiences post my qualification as a one of the more prominent areas of the department of defense i was well prepared i was all over my brief i knew exactly what i had to do with this individual from a coaching perspective i walked in the door and he looked at me and said you 're old enough to be my granddaughter what are you doing in my office and in that moment i was like yeah i don 't really know and i probably am a fraud and i don 't know what i 'm doing and all of a sudden all this anxiety kicked in but in that moment the ability to adapt and say i 'll give you 10 minutes if you still don 't want me here in 10 minutes time i will leave you with your day i don 't know where that came from it just kind of happened but that ability to kind of adapt when things are messy really important the example i also use here um is that of the bison i don 't know if anyone 's heard this story so bear with me if you characters when it comes to thinking about challenges so their counterpart is the cow when there is a storm coming the cow will run in the opposite direction to get away from the storm okay the bison however does not avoid does not run away does not head in the opposite direction it actually stops and then runs straight towards this and you know what by running straight towards the storm they run straight through it in about a quarter of the time of avoiding it and stronger on the other side because they 've gotten through it so often use that analogy um and i have to remind myself of that as well because we get to points in time and i 'm sure everyone here has i i know i have when something is hard overwhelming big difficult i just kind of go i 'm going to sit on my phone for about three hours and pretend that 's not happening or i 'm just going to eat all that food i can find or you know people turn to drugs and alcohol and all these ways of so i often use this experience of okay i just have to kind of head into the storm straight through it one step at a time and sometimes it feels like the tiniest steps forward and other times we spread through it but it 's kind of the example that i use around adapting when things can become quite tough [Music] except so this is the second of third elements that i talk to people about there 's a whole lot of stuff out there people say have you tried relaxation have you tried mindfulness i know it works i 'm a convert but i also hate hearing it from people when things are going poorly so what i have to talk to people about and have to remind myself is that we need to make room for the uncomfortable we need to kind of open up and say you know what today was a pretty crappy day i 'm just going to let it sit there and i 'm going to see how tomorrow goes so we 're not overwhelmed by it but we 're also kind of letting i guess it doesn 't become bigger because we 're just kind of looking at it we 're just going yep that felt really crappy i 'm just going to let that sit until i 'm ready ready to run through the storm ready to process it ready to talk about it all ready to move forward i we also talk a lot and i noticed in some of the youth week material as well around small steps so we often search for a big um like a big solution to a big problem when actually the small steps are what matters if i can get up today if i can have a hot shower and text a friend that 's two incredibly brave steps forward if i 'm super anxious about something if i don 't want to ring that person that i upset the other day if i text them first that 's a step forward if i take a moment to just breathe and settle my heart rate that 's a step forward so the acceptance that we can 't solve everything at once but we can i guess also the example i use here and you 've definitely heard it before if not is that a broken crayon can still create magic so we don 't need to be a perfect being to get out there and and do something or a perfect kind of um unscathed human who 's never been through anything we can still get out there and we can give that our best shot and the final piece um that i talk about is connection so the ability to connect when it matters is absolutely critical so joanna spoke a little bit about values like why am i doing this why would i go and you know talk at a community event that makes me feel really anxious because community matters to me and you guys matter to me that 's why i 'm here why are we doing certain things you know why do we want that job why does that job look interesting um and i guess as well the ability to connect when we 're not feeling okay but the ability to connect when we notice someone else isn know it can be really hard to have the conversation or not know what words or language to use around noticing that someone 's not okay um but the ability to connect absolutely critical family friends pets exercise there 's many ways to connect so for me i often find myself talking to people about the mental health continuum this is the only kind of piece of information i 'm going to provide but remembering that we are all on a continuum so what i 've observed often in workplaces in leadership programs in clinical settings when i 'm working with someone is oh that 's for people who are over there and they 're unwell and i 'm okay here you know what we 're all on this continuum and it can move very quickly it can move very slowly but i often just talk to people about are you in the green zone are you in the orange zone or are you in the red zone so that ability to identifying others and ourselves where we might be on that continuum at any given point in time is with mental health mental illness etc but one of the best resources that i know of is the headspace online support area so go there and check it out the reason i really like this as a resource is that it kind of is a bit of a build your own adventure so once you 've created a login you can describe what 's happening for you and it will feed you exactly what you need also you have online clinicians available for sms for discussion for chat group support there is a range of wonderful tools and resources and on the right hand side there there is also a range of other areas to reach out to not forgetting that the kids help line is available for much older than what we would see as kids so possibly a rebrand required but i like people to know that that 's a really important number you are talking with qualified people on the other end of all of these lines and that 's what 's most important and it 's not just crisis that 's what i say to people is horrendous face to face in parks we know that um we 're all working to kind of um sort through that but with telehealth online and also um the availability of services there is people out there to help if you 're worried about someone pick up and talk about what 's happening for them that 's going to be helpful in the long run so i guess my parting thoughts are really quite simple the first one is eat the cake because life is going to throw lots of challenges and we 're able to treat ourselves in this context i would say eat the packed plants because they are literally the best in new south wales um and smile there are going to be people around that can help you there are people that you can have a laugh with when you need to and it 's really important in terms of navigating those challenges we have and basically you matter that 's why everyone is here youth are so critical in our community thank you very much thanks carly for not only sharing your story but apply in our daily lives to navigate life 's challenges i 'll introduce jacob cass who is the country university center manager so jacob 's going to talk through some practical tips on applying for jobs as well as interviewing and building your resume so i 'll hand it over to jacob thank you very much and welcome everybody to the youth week workshops it 's been fantastic hearing some of the stories that have come out of today and very happy to be here today sharing some of my knowledge uh help some people with their job applications resumes and their interview skills so to fit resume building into a 20 minute time slot is a little bit difficult so i thought today we might focus on one of the hardest parts of building a resume which lot of people don 't realize is something they can do which is hard and soft skills so building a resume template you can go online you can find those you can search in microsoft word and you 'll find 100 different templates that are just as good as anything i can explanation though of what to put on that template so everyone knows that you list your work experience you say that from this date to this date i worked here from here to here but what about your actual skills is it only what you have been taught can you only put down that you went to university and you have a business degree can you only put down that you went to tafe and you have a cert foreign computing or does it matter that you can hold a conversation that you can walk into a room and present does it matter that you like other people all those things matter and it matters to resumes in particular when looking for work so why do we include skills in our resume so aside from outlining the obvious which is that i hold the qualification for the role i 'm applying for it tells the employer that you 're the kind of person they want working at their company so most employers will have a mission statement it 'll be that their business or their organization wants to achieve something field they 'll also generally have a set of goals or guidelines in which they want their employees to live by it might be that their employees are always kind to people it might be that their employee is always presentable these are usually on their website you can find them as part of your research for a role but they 're important to listing your cv so they know what kind of person you are and what kind of person that they 're employing so if there 's two candidates that walk into a role and both of them have been employed for the same amount of time they both hold the exact same qualification and they have similar experiences what it comes down to is their interpersonal skills is one of them warm is one of them a better match for the environment in which they 're going into or are they both similar what you put down and what you display in an interview can determine whether or not you get a role so what is a soft skill so a soft skill is an interpersonal skill piece of paper you generally can 't walk in with a certificate in good manners or a certificate that says that you 're presentable but what you can do is demonstrate those you can list them on your resume and then you can demonstrate them in your interview as part of your answers to your questions or even just by being five minutes early for your interview being well dressed well groomed and being prepared as opposed to a hard skill which refers to something that you can actually show on paper a hard skill might be proof that you have a computing degree it might be proof that you have a trade certificate a forklift license those are all hard skills that you can prove with a piece of paper and they 're just as important because you there are certain roles you can 't get without actually having the hard skills but if two people walk in a room with the exact same qualification it comes down to the soft skills to put you over the line so soft skills versus hard skills as we 've said the a qualification for one a piece of paper that says you can do it and the other one you have to show so hard skills are qualifiable soft skills are not so a comparison soft skills problem solving skills [Music] how will you communicate [Music] these demonstrate how well you suit a particular role so just thinking about some soft skills have you guys ever played a sport a team sport netball soccer football yeah okay team player you can put that on a resume and at your age applying for your first lot of jobs coming out of school or even when you come out of university soft skills are what you really need to hone in on they 're what you need to drive home because you 're coming out with the same qualifications as everybody else in your year yes the subjects might be different you may have achieved different things at school but at the end of the day you 're coming out with a high school certificate a school certificate a tafe cert for but your interpersonal skills can really sell you over the line of full-time work whether it be a mcdonald 's whether it be in reception whether it be in business you can still apply those skills to get you over the line of an entry level position hard skills what qualification or degree or certificate do you hold has anybody here done a tafe certificate through school have you looked at them you can get a certificate two in around about three to six months a cert three can take up to twelve so you can get some of those for your first lot of jobs you could go and get yourself a cert three in individual support set three in iet they might come down to things like how proficient you are in a particular language do you speak multiple languages generally the skills you need in the hard skill category will be listed in the application process for the job it 'll tell you exactly what you need you 'll be able to rule yourself out on the hard skills straight away yes i 've gone away and got my trade certificate yes i 'm qualified for that but across the line first people with the exact same skill set now hard skills are important i keep driving home that they 're a piece of paper but they are important if you 're applying to be an accountant you generally need that hard skill if you 're applying to be a doctor you definitely need that hard skill there are things that you can 't get around by just having soft skills so they are very important and if you 're looking to build a career path you should look at what hard skills you need to acquire to get into that field so if you were looking to say go down the air out of becoming an i.t professional you might need to look at traineeship options you might need to look at what an entry level position requires it might be a cert four it might be that you can get into some of those roles without one but hard skills are important no matter what soft skills these are distinguishing factors between job seekers every role i 've ever applied for i have driven home organizational some of those you can get a hard skill in you can get a certificate leadership and management but natural leadership skills you can put down on paper it doesn 't necessarily mean that they 're going to believe you straight away but it 's something you can show in your examples and your answers in interview and it 's something they can list in the back of their minds for later when they 're hiring you for the entry level role that they can have something in place that steps you into something in the future so examples of hard skills we said accounting dentistry you generally can 't_''_3896.88 be a dentist without it computer programming engineering degrees marketing human resources you might want to be a plumber an electrician those are all things that require hard skills examples of soft skills interpersonal skills communication skills professionalism time management flexibility leadership now these are all things that you can identify now while you 're still this age things you can come out of high school with if you 've sat on the src if you 've been away to captaining sporting teams these are things you can put down for all of your soft skills so the connection between the two two candidates walk in all room they have the exact same skill set down to their hard skills they 've been in employment the same amount of time and they have similar experience in previous roles what it comes down to is selling your soft skills over the other applicant making sure that not only do you list it in your resume and your cover letter that you have these skills but that you 're also able to demonstrate them so what i 'm going to do now is we 've got an activity i 've given you two job that are currently being advertised in parks one is for a delivery driver and the other one is for a client services officer so either individually and i 'll come around and give you a hand what i 'd like you to do is have a look at both the roles have a read and see if you can 't list out some of the soft skills you want for each of those roles and the hard skills that you believe you would be required for each of those roles as well and then we 'll come together as a group and we 'll see if we can 't build the perfect resume or list of skills for a resume for somebody to apply for one of these two jobs all right so what we 'll do is we 'll have a look at the delivery driver role and we 'll list some of the we 'll start with the hard skills and then we 'll try and build our soft skills based off of that so in the advert for the role they have an about you section and in that they tell you the skills and attributes they look for in a person something that you can then expand on in your application process so they 're after somebody with a current and valid mrhr license and a forklift license so what do you think our first set of hard skills would be something qualifiable that you can show them that you have a skill set so we 've got the hr license [Music] okay and we 've got the forklift ticket now straight away that tells you two things they 're after somebody who can be on the road and somebody who can operate in a factory or a warehouse setting or a depot setting so what are some soft skills that you can automatically draw from these two hard skills things that you believe it 's important for them to know that you possess [Music] so for instance for both of these you need to be safety conscious so whether that be on the roads or around other people you 're working in a hazardous environment so you 're safe you 're mindful of others [Music] okay now they may be the only hard skills that you can qualify for this sort of role they 're the only ones that they 're after they 're not after anything else however the other hard skill you could possess would be a qualification in warehousing whether it be a assert for in warehousing or even something in whs being work health and safety so they are role now other soft skills for a delivery person might be something around their presentation okay yep perfect interpersonal skills now you might think that it 's not the delivery person making the sales but at the end of the day they 're the face of the business they 're the person who aside from the person who sold the client the items the delivery driver is their only other point of contact if that person is rude isn 't on time is it mindful or is it understanding of what the customer 's saying they 're not going to want to do business with you anymore so that is a skill that 's important to have and if you walk in and you can demonstrate into personal skill in this sort of role it is going to benefit you now obviously with deliveries they want someone who 's organized someone who can communicate so you 'd also want to have you organized you want to be able to communicate and that doesn 't just include for the client but also back to your own office if you 're running lost paperwork you need to communicate that back and the last one i think we can list under soft skills does anybody have it or another one perfect team player that 's excellent [Music] and that goes hand in hand with your with your safety you know you 're working at a depot there 's going to be other people around you need to be a team player so that is a demonstration of how you can draw out soft skills that apply to a role they are just as important as any of these and if you go into a work interview and you have these and somebody else has them as well they can be the things that get you over the line you turn up on time you look organized you 're well presented you can communicate in the interview that you are the best applicant you can demonstrate you 're a team player with your examples and you can show that you 're mindful of others and you have those interpersonal skills that can be enough to put you over the line and something that employers people who are a team player who are organized and who can communicate and that 's soft and hard skills thank you very much and best of luck in the future [Music] thanks jacob for sharing all those tips and tricks um for those of you who don 't know jacob is actually based next door in our country university center so if anyone wants to pop in and see him he 'll be there we might be able to make an appointment by their facebook page so our last guest for this evening is india rochelly from pat cones so india is here to talk through taking an id and making it happen such as packed cones so please join me all in welcoming india hello everybody all those of you that stayed right to the end so i have always lived in parks i briefly went overseas when i finished year 12 and studied at university over there i never intended to do that um i didn 't think that that was going to be my part but i 'm so glad i did because when i was more accepting of others i realized what it 's like to be somebody in a community i couldn 't speak spanish yet they threw me into a house with people that couldn 't speak english so it sort of changed everything for me and i became a more accepting person of others and i know sometimes you see somebody who can 't_``_4354.239 speak english very well you think oh they must be so silly like they they can 't communicate properly or whatever but i was that that was me and in english my english world i was so confident and i could talk about anything but then being in that setting i was so timid and shy and i couldn 't get my message across and it was it was really eye-opening so i was destined to study dentistry and that 's what i wanted to study when i was in high school i was like this is what i 'm doing sounds great looks great people are going to think i 'm really smart that 's what i i think i want to do i had to go didn 't go to this study camp that tony abbott 's daughter was going to i was going to fail and i can 't study at home because i 'd be in my room and my mum would come in and she 'd be like hey do you want to go for lunch today or something like mom i 'm studying get back and um i actually used to come here quite a bit as my safe place there 's like a little quiet room down the hallway down there and you can go in there lock yourself away from all of your siblings and everything and you can actually get some good study done but um i also did realise like what um she had touched on earlier sorry i can 't remember her name now she um said that like she pushed herself way too hard and whatever didn 't you end up using it but you do you do actually use it it 's good to push yourself as much as you can but you need to not shy away from joining in on other little activities talking i was like oh my god she 's saying what i was going to say but i was in every committee everything that i could do that i 'd get a ticket for like um buddy carriage on committee src public speaking i 'm not a sporty person but i was sports captain obviously they picked me because of my soft skills because i knew how to get people to make badges and i was organized and all this sort of stuff so you really just got to get in there and have a go and um i never intended on starting a business quite like this it sort of came out of covert but when i left school went to uni decided i didn 't want to do that started three different uni courses didn 't want to do any of them did half a beautician 's course started up a makeup thing from home and was doing heap of makeup and stuff i just never really knew where i sat and you guys probably feel the same like i didn 't know what i wanted to be that other people will think is good that 's not important and i think you 'll realize that when you get a little bit older when you 're young what other people think matters so much but yeah like what i was going to say was i started working at the rms and i got thrown into it support and i 'm not an i.t support gal but i 'm good at talking and i could wing my way through most situations and while i 'd be talking to somebody i 'll be looking up the answers and then i could sound like i knew what i was talking about and majority of the time the people i was talking to on the other end that needed help they just wanted to feel safe like they knew that they were going to be helped and someone actually cared on the end of the phone like when you call telstra and they don 't really care i was that was me and i was like well i know when i call telstra and they sound like they don 't care it talking about earlier with the resume when you 're trying to apply for a job you think what did i like when i went there and i thought man they i wish they would just come up to me and like i 've been coming to this cafe for 10 years surely they know my name i wish they 'd sort of talk to me like they knew me you know what i mean and um since we 've had the business i 'll talk about that later but i 've noticed a lot of things that i 've wanted from kids have come from those soft skills and such but yeah after i 'd um done my it support work i had a baby and lost that position completely and i 'd never thought that i was going to have a baby quite so young but i 'm so glad that i did because it again made me realize that what other people think doesn 't matter at all you 've got to do what makes yourself happy and if you 're genuinely happy working with whatever you 're at it so um don 't focus so much on what other people think but yeah just go for it and um i when i was at home with my baby my mum had realized that we we operate this together obviously my mom and my sister she realized that there was a gap for um food in the market and she 'd been working on the main street in the in the pharmacy for about 15 years and i had this baby and i was staying at home and i was like oh i wish she could come to an appointment with me and she couldn 't get time off work and she 's like this isn 't what i want to be doing when i get older i want to be with you and the baby and i was like i don 't want to go back to work either i want to be at home with my baby so we started a catering business and we were catering for quite a few council functions and rms things and i was giving food to people who i used functions stopped like 21st weddings funerals all that sort of thing that we were catering for all the time pretty much ended completely so we were left with not much at all but it was a really good break where we got to stop and think is this what we are we really happy so busy working so hard and food like that is not super profitable we were working like banging out 150 sandwiches and whatever but shopping and doing all that mixing dips and everything that we would we were supplying to customers was hard work really hard work and um when covert hit and we got a break we were walking down the street and we saw the um i don 't know if you know where packed cones is but we saw the um the shop sorry i 'm talking so far so i 'm getting parched but we saw the shop across the road from the um broadway hotel and does everyone know where my packed cones is yeah so um assuming way that 's better so um we walked past and we saw that to put something in there i don 't know what yet but i would love to put something there and i was like right oh here we go she 's got a new business idea every second day and um we were at home and she said when i was at the chemist i noticed a lot of people asking like where can i get an ice cream and there was no nowhere in town that you could really get an ice cream they had like a few places had um some tubs in a freezer in the corner that had too much ice or whatever but um she said travellers especially at like elvis time and all of that there 's nowhere to go and uh can you believe the one time we start up an ice cream shop there 's no elvis like we were like this is it this is the year these elvis people are gonna get their ice cream and there 's no elvis festival but um yeah so in covid we sat down and we were like what do we actually need we thought got to stock us this really awesome italian family hand make all of our gelato in sydney and we have um heaps of communication with them we come up with flavors we get ingredients sent to them and we worked closely with them to like get all of our flavors and stuff organized i 'm not a massive food person myself but if i was going into a gelato shop i 'd know what i 'd want to see and um mum is amazing with food so i guess that 's why i 'm not so good because she has just done that for me forever but i 'm more good with the um the i.t side of things so i 'm organized and i can take care of all the paperwork so together we work as a really good team and my sister she 's just a flat-out comedian so um the three of us combined make newly a whole person and in covert actually our rentals that we were living in got sold so we all moved back into the same house and between my sister and i they 're crazy and they love ice cream so we don 't make much profit really but um we we knuckled down and we got our freezers we thought we did and then a um a forklift operator dropped our massive freezer off the front of a forklift and smashed it three weeks before we were supposed to open and we had to try find another one but it was italian custom italian glass from italy and in the middle of covert nothing 's shipping in or out all of these places in italy got massively affected so we had to try and find something else and then four attempts it took to get our freezers into the shop and the day it arrived they try to wheel it in the front door and it won 't fit and the door is like the glass in the doors bolted into the frame so we had to forklift our freezer through the window we finally got it in there and i was like you know what is it too late to quit like when it wouldn 't fit through the door out because there 's been so many obstacles that i 've been hit with we were this close to just saying look you know what we 've we 're not actually going to do it anymore we were just joking but after we got past that um yeah we got stuck into it and the support that we 've got from the community has been amazing and we 've got 17 juniors that work for us now and um employing those juniors i 've come to realize that yeah those soft skills are what we employ people on and it 's not so much how good it looks on paper although it is good to have a few different things listed on there like being in a committee or putting your hand up or like showing up or whatever but um the thing that i found most important when hiring someone is that they don 't um say they sort of volunteer a little bit if you know what i mean like they 're not afraid to keep showing up and helping i 've just put a new kid on kid he kept coming back and he was like look i really want to get a go i really want to start with you guys um do you need a hand packing up tonight and i 'd be like actually i 'm really stuck because these kids just left he had to go home can you help me pack up so he ended up packing up for me a few times and then he just sort of kept being there when i needed someone and i was like look mate you 've been amazing he i didn 't think he was going to be much of a start doesn 't come from a fantastic family or whatever but he has been 100 my best worker because he just kept showing up kept giving it a go bring his resume in twice he said look i 've gone and done something extra this is what i can do now as well does this help me out and i was like yeah mate you know what it sure does so he works with us now and we 're still learning and um what we thought was going to be the most important has ended up not being as important as what we originally expected but um i have been writing dot points in my phone about what i 'm going to say next so if you think oh she 's just texting up the back actually i 'm winging it i didn 't have time to do this earlier with all my kids at home yeah i pretty much touched on everything guys i written down there that soft skills have been more important and yeah i hope you 're all ready for another scoop of gelato because i 've got plenty i 've got enough there to cater for 200 so free to take a scoop home thanks so much for listening to me thanks in for that inspiring story and also very comical story um so thank you everyone for coming um and thank you to our amazing guest speakers for taking the time to share their stories and provide you guys here in the room with some really great tips for youth week 2021 so as indie said if yourselves take a scoop home

a road through the middle to resemble that they just you were traveling on a road of disasters and it just keeps going my message for my painting is always stay positive in life even though bad things happen life is a journey um yeah farm life is good you can have a little bit of not so good but mainly good you you 're free and you don 't have any neighbors or anyone you don 't hear anyone yeah i do talk to my mum she kind of helps me go through life a little yeah yeah i want to be an artist and an art teacher when i grow up i want to teach kids how to do art and want to learn more about her and and just draw more and paint more here i just escaped to well i don 't know how to describe it it 's something it makes me feel calm and makes me feel happy yes art is very important especially for little kids to begin with because it 's perhaps an imagine like an imagination for them and it also inspires them to do stuff when they 're older [Music] any color that 's not exactly just bland it 's kind of an imaginary inspiration for imagination and it inspires brightness happiness peacefulness [Music] my goal for the future is to become a veterinarian and to be able to help animals um help people who would prefer their animals to be healthy and sort of sick [Music] and to give hope to people who need it most is art important yeah i think it is it 's important because it 's an expression of the self it helps define who you are and show everyone who you are and creates an individual in the process well relationships do play an important part in these times because well without someone to hold you up and help you along in this in a trying time you just stumble over and fall into a pit of was really i wanted to show something that was hopeful but i wanted to show something that showed the suffering of the individuals that are going through this event it 's just something to show the hardships but there is light at the end of the tunnel i 'd i 'd like to think the picture does show hope but then again that 's up to the viewer in the eye of the beholder well i like to think that the mother koala climbing up the tree out of the smoke and the embers and flames to protect her baby it 's to protect her future and the trees burned and broken but it 's still there and supporting her and that 's really what matters i kind of chose this image of the koalas just because really i saw the poor little buckets walking across the scorched and burning road on the news one night with my mom on tv and it really hit me it 's just look at these poor little things they 're suffering so much and i mean you just want to reach him pull everything 's all right give him some water scratch behind the ear yeah i can relate that to the human experience i mean everyone needs a bit of help in a trying time it 's it 's just human nature to want help even if you don 't feel like you want it you you 're still deep down you really know you need it to want to give help it 's something very fulfilling and being able to actually help someone or something it 's well it 's really something you should strive for [Music] i like taking photos of the animals because then i can show everyone at home what i saw and i usually go down around the paddock and the creek where most of the birds are near the water down near the creek with our cousins and that we made a little like stick heart sort of by a dead tree and i sometimes use that just to sit in there and wait for some birds to come to me um i usually wear a camouflage jumper and pants along with boots because it 's weather and the day sometimes it takes a little while but sometimes they 're already there i go down the creek with my grandma sometimes and she also brings her camera so we both take some photos down there i usually go down there after school and depending on if it 's rained um it 's sometimes flowing but not really usually in summer it 's usually really dry but in the winter there 's lots of birds down around in the water especially ducks and water birds [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] um well i chose that subject because i thought it would be nice after all the flowers after all the fires to see everything blooming again up in sydney so when i went up to sydney not long ago i saw them blooming and just coming out of the shells so when i came back i 'm like that would be great to do for other resilience i use watercolor pencils so i colored it in really dark and then i just went over it with just a little bit of water to make it garden in just out the front of my house well art is makes me relax and it gets me in my happy place when i 'm drawing and painting and coloring so that 's the thing i like about art i do think art is important because well without art we wouldn 't really be in the place we 'd be right now because art is used everywhere yes i would like to continue my art in the future um i would like to maybe paint and draw more flowers and plants maybe just so they can maybe go in more competitions in the future i do talk to friends i do talk to about art with one of my friends and we really like art so it 's really nice to know that she 's supporting me there too [Music] [Music] [Music] do well a drought means like the feeling of water because if you don 't have water there 's not really much you can do because waters like aren 't basically number one priority yes i do think it 's important to save water because if we much that we can do again because if we don 't have water we one can 't brush our teeth two can 't have buzz three can 't make crops grow full like you can 't let cattle live and yeah yes i do think um photography can capture the crisis because if you take a photo or if you draw it or if you make a poem or a song about it it like savors it and if you don 't like take recognition of it not many people are gonna like realize that it 's happening what i do on the farm and what i like on the farm is like going out and going to check on the goats um my sister she 's got a goat and whenever we go out it follows us so yeah it 's kind of like a little dog and it 's pretty fun because like you 've got a lot of other um beings and not just humans and you don 't really know how they 're going to act if they 're going to be friendly or if they that like either dancing or photography or drawing is important because like it gets your mind off things and it 's an activity i like hip-hop because it 's fast but not too fast and you can make up like sort of break dancing but yeah not completely do i like to do art photography and a bit of embroidery too i like photography because it expresses my emotions and just pictures i like to photograph life and the living with my drawing i like to draw cartoons and i painted birds and rabbits and bees but my personal favorite was um my princess sunshine she 's always giving the world hope even though she has no superpowers in yeah she 's got a nice little shirt shirt with a lovely little sign what represents hope i definitely think that art is a language and it 's because i expresses your emotions when you 're thinking you 're talking but art is basically everywhere so you 're expressing your emotions almost anywhere living on a farm is like just a bit stressful but fun a bit calming and you 've chickens getting some soon we 've got two puppies ducks cats fish all sorts of things coke 19 has affected me in a little bit we all stay strong it 's in our nature there 's nothing better than going and seeing your friends but if you can 't go and see your friends you can always facetime them it 's not human to actually well stay locked up it 's just not human so you have to visit your friends every once in a while hope moves us forward smoke fills my eyes replacing the dust how much more before you all lose trust i watch my life they 're unbelievable it 's all too much for us we must be leaving my heart hurts and sings so this is what i think we must be strong we must go on like others before me we must remember we are still free to 2031 i 'm hoping the situation is done back in the day it wasn 't_''_1060.16 all swell as 2020 was complete healthy it all started with droughts and fires inside the warlords with getting any hair of course cover 19 came with death kobe bryant along with his daughter they caught a plane right into the floor after of course a black sims was killed floyd was gone from an officer 's will now we were stuck for protest i 'm only sad to see that black people are lonely then we found our corey 's almost gone hope that soon will be forgotten i hope it 's better over there even it 's so scary that this year was of sadness but now it 's all gone we 're almost there to 21. i hope that you will be the best but i 'm gonna survive after a while at least we gave 2020 a try i 'll try and try we gave 2020 a try as you may know along with cover 19 suicide was the solution for those younger than teens as if that was gone but we can 't take back what happened in the past then people took walls off the shelves sure like that will help as i said at the start it was the worst of the time most girl was sat she was hurting of course in the sight of her mother with this cursed disease oh no now i discovered killer bees i hope it 's better over there even it 's so scared that this year was of sadness but now it 's all gone we 're almost there to 21. i hope that you will be the best but i 'm gonna survive after a while at least we gave 2020 a try i 'll try and try we gave 2020 a try yes that 's true master birth thing you couldn 't leave your house unless you 're willing to make a scene or hoping to die from a virus we know i hate the year 2020 because day 2031 i hope i live to tell the story about how 2020 was doc and glory can 't_''_1189.84 you tell that you was hell i hope it 's better over there even it 's so scary that this year was the year of sadness but now it 's all gone we 're almost there to 21. i hope that you will be the best but gave 2020 a try i 'll try and try we gave 2020 a try [Music] and even if it wasn 't_''_1226.48 all right may through 2020 every day and night so 2021 will be here and it 's quite clear i hope it 's better over there even it 's so scary that this year was the year of sadness but now it 's all gone we 're almost i hope that you will be the best but i 'm gonna survive after a while at least we gave 2020 a try but try and try we gave 2020 a try um the concept of the picture was well as the competition states resilience so i wanted to show how nature can bounce back after something traumatic such as a drought as we are experiencing these days i 'd say um to notice the changes in the environment and in our world you would really have to take time to look at it all um because on a daily basis i don 't notice certain changes until i actually take the time to just relax and look around um school one really has the time to pay attention to these things my heart affects me um it 's my way of release these days are very stressful and hectic so when i do art i just go into my own world i forget about everything else around me and just enjoy myself do what i want to do i can create anything there 's no limits i 'd say i mean with my artworks i don 't have a specific message i let the viewers in the audience interpret it themselves so i 'd say with art anyone can depict any sort of emotions any message from anything one might look at an artwork and see just pain and sorrow and others might see some sort of hope that can come after all that um yeah art is a very there 's no limitation to it in my opinion there 's no restrictions on what you can express through it [Music] you should respect the firefighters because firefighting is a dangerous job you have to be brave to be a firefighter [Music] we have to save water because there isn as they can or don 't not thinking about it there wouldn 't be any left and you need that water because you need a drink you need to feed your animals you need to water your crops [Music] keeping a safe distance means to stay 1.5 meters away from each other because if you don 't you could spread the virus and then more and more people every day would get it and have a risk of dying stay strong stay confident keep happy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] music is important in difficult times to me because it 's just you can just zone out and just go into a different world and focus on that song and just um really just put your effort into it and just don 't not think about anything else i love music and um yeah i just i love listening to songs and i just want to one day maybe like like i have write songs yeah so that 's really why i 've written the song and just maybe um tell people that everything 's gonna be okay and yeah the of uh all the different things that australia and now the world has gone through and just kind of put them all into one song so i named the song focus because um just we need to focus and stay strong and look at the bigger picture and the silver lining and just gonna we 're gonna eventually get out of this out of this pandemic [Music] the world around us is scary right now but it won 't always be this way even though we hear a lot of negativity we need to focus and do this together stay to the our leaders you don 't have to agree with what they say [Music] stay safe [Music] keep us safe [Music] all the sadness and scary stuff going round with the fires and floods now we 're in a global pandemic and our country 's going crazy we need to focus and do this together stay safe have to agree with what they say [Music] stay safe they 're there to keep us safe [Music] we know that we 've been through a rough time we 've been brave [Music] we need to focus and do this together [Music] you don 't have to agree with what they say stay safe and listen to the rules us safe [Music] they 're there to keep us safe so in my drawing i did a lot of detail and a lot of re sharpening of pencils and lots of different changes lots of details that just took forever to get right to create it it took a lot of time i really don 't know how long um i just know it took a lot of time and effort and a lot of details that just took forever it felt like forever to do so on our farm we mum does lots of the paperwork dad and i look after the animals and my brother helps us feed all the babies i like to look after the babies and see the animals grow up from little little stragglers to big sheep and the chunks just from when we see them at like the size of a 50 cent piece to a chicken laying eggs like yeah i think being a farmer of the nation and supply wool and clothing and all that sort of stuff how i got the information from my poem was by taking little bits of information out of my own life and a little bit of information about how parks has gone through this covey time and how we have adjusted and made our life made our lives kobe safe some of the problems that i believe people have been facing since even september october last year was the drought i thought was a really big one and took a really big hit on most of the farmers here in parks how no water everything was so dry i also thought that bushfires was also a very big one as we had a couple around here like blue mountains and we had a small one in dubbo i remember that was again sort of you couldn 't really go anywhere you were sort of trapped again you got stuck in the fire couldn 't go out and that 's what i thought was something that really took a big impact on a lot of small country towns trouble by it helps me express and even understand what 's been happening so if something big has happened in life i believe that it 's just easier for me to express it through poetry it 's just easier for me to even understand it more how i feel about dance is that it sort of helps me calm down and find my center again and it 's something that i really enjoy and that i know i can always dance if i need to and because i do mostly ballet and contemporary they 're sort of really slow styles and it 's really easy to express your emotions through them remember when let us try to remember this time last september when all was quiet and calm then all of a sudden the drought was upon us the dry dust and sand soaped out through all the land soon the water ran out and nothing came out on the spout then came the disease which someone was pleased with such might it came to us overnight as we had the man without a plan while he sat and ate our biggest test it started off really small with nobody worried at all because we had other things to dread it was said to be the worst fires of all nothing could stop it nobody could but nobody here was misunderstood it was something that cost us tons as australia lost all its funds and even still today some families have a price to pay it was truly devastating in every way then the trumpet sounded as no more fires were founded but called the paramedic because here comes a pandemic as more people became sick this disease spread real quick there was nothing we could do except wait until the day was through of what we once thought was our town we slowly descended into lockdown while we were all longing for the past every day was worse than the last as our colony found a new way to bloom soon everything was over zoom now because of kofi 19 we are stuck in quarantine soon everyone started to stock up on their food we were all in a panicked mood all the toilet paper ran out on the liquor ran out even quicker when our turn came it caused everyone so much pain we tried to push through it as best we could as together we stood nothing and no one will ever be the same as we continue to play this game soon one day it will just stop and just like that we 'll be back on top [Music] the flower in my picture represents the people that have died in the coronavirus crisis and the new life that 's happening one of my most treasured memories are my animals that i 've lost i 've lost quite a few animals what my horse had to be my horse went to another home i one of my budgies died the cat that i really loved got bitten by a snake and yeah i 've lost quite a few i remember with my cat how she i remember when she laid up in my lap i have a photo of that time and my fighter fish he 'll always bury himself under the gravel and every time i went up to the fish tank he 'll swim i used to bring them out on my bed on the sheets and they 'll eat the food and run around in that our world has been turned upside down all because of cover 19. people are losing loved ones people are having to hide behind a mask the rose represents someone who has died during these times and a girl hiding behind a mask and two quotes saying and explaining how hard it has been when someone you love becomes a memory that memory becomes the treasure it 's so hard having to hide our smiles behind a mask i 'm a sixth generation farmer and um i like most things about the farm except from the drought that we 've been having um most of the time it 's pretty good but um yeah the tractor driving 's the best and sheep 's pretty good um one day i got a call from my dad and he said that there was a weird storm coming up on the horizon and um so i got my drone out and took it up then um i got my little gopro took a time lapse of it well i had the drone up took a few photos in a video and that 's how i got the photo yeah i wasn 't expecting that but yeah we had a lot of little dust storms but this was the biggest one just got the drone back in time before it came over i just got back inside and then pretty much everything went dark and it was like under pretty quiet and dark for like the next two hours my business is about taking photos and video for farming and also real estate and solar farms yeah i bought a drone about four years ago to take video and photo around the farm and photos for people and videos i saved up for um for shoveling sheep manure and also raising potty lambs i have a few friends interested in photography and videography and they 've been helping me around the place they 've been like reviewing my videos and a few of them even took us like about the same photo of that dust storm and that was pretty cool yeah experience and my mum helped me make the logo and my dad 's been showing me around the place the farm watch take photos of and um he 's even stopped the tractor a few times to take a few photos of it i got the idea from what i would see on the farm me friends farms and me uh family member farms and what i would see out in the paddock and uh sometimes it might be a cow head or a um sheep that 's passed away and i 'd get some inspiration from that and see new life growing from that and that 's where i got the idea for this artwork for the bull head to have flowers natural flowers that you would find just out in the bush in the scrub and just drew them with a bit of color growing out of the skull they are important the cycles that because when something old passes something new and beautiful grows from it which is great to watch because it 's very visual and other people see it easier learning visual than learning with it more appealing to learn through a visual experience than a learning with a book i like doing drawings and that and i could learn to be a architect if i want to learn that in the future i 'm a bit i would like to learn new skills anything that seems interesting i 'll give it a go and have crack at it and have fun with it [Music] [Music] farmers are important because they grow all the grains and all the crops for us to eat and sell or do whatever with what i like about photography is the correct creativity side like you don 't know what you 'll find to photograph next or what it 's going to turn out like what i like about my image is the end of the railway track where you don 't know where it 's leading or where it 's going what it 's doing or what it has on it the track can go anywhere it could go to shops to sell or to other farmers so they can eat it or sell it or feed to their is going and that 's what creates the mystery of the image you can think anything the colors in the image represent the drought like the grass with the browns and the light oranges and all those colors but the sky also represents the sun coming down which is the drought as well and the clouds could represent hope if there could be rain coming to hopefully break the drought [Music] so the techniques i used were um just lines and lots of color and like going with the lines kind of thing the colors i chose were darker colors for the more gloomy side and then brighter colors for the more happy side my superhero represents everyone blocking all the bad stuff that 's been happening kobe 19 the bushfires drought everyone does get the chance to be a superhero because they can do it by helping others there are other art forms i 'm interested in painting and clay i used crayon with my artwork i changed the grip on the way i held the crayon brave people can overcome anything just keep on trying and you will better always stay strong always imagine something better besides writing poetry i also do team gymnastics and we got a special routine and costumes but we haven 't been able to perform it because of covert i like writing poetry because i like mixing around the words and making it make sense i decided on the title find the sun because during the bushfires you had to really look carefully for the sun and once you found it it just looked like a dot in the sky blood red sky and unbreathable air i got it because the fire is like red and like the flames you could see them and it looked like red and i described it and stuff and unbreathable air because of all the smoke and it just felt like you couldn 't breathe sometimes i 've seen it on the news and i 've seen images and stuff and it looked really like i described it in my poem find the sun blood red sky and unbreathable air thousands of homes burnt and people in despair there 's nothing left everyone 's exhausted and anxious on but here you are despite it all despite the fires and cove it 's cool be proud of your persistence your strength and resilience [Music] art is important because it it takes your mind of everything and you concentrate on what you 're doing you don 't focus on anything else but art resilience don 't look away from issues you know no learning to cope will help you to grow you feel so alone even at home dark times go remember to keep the flames aglow [Music] uh when the bushfire started there was a lot of people affected by it and they looked so sad so yeah i made the girl and honorance of representing the children of australia witnessing the the fires before them i think it 's really important because if there 's no imagination then you 're only focused on the real world and sometimes the real world can be hard i love art and i like that you can express yourself there 's no limits to art and there 's no right and wrong it makes me feel calm and sometimes my fault 's a bit overwhelming so in art when i do it then i can just let them go in my drawing the girl 's putting her hand on the window she really wants to help the people um outside but sometimes you can 't tell them even though you want to i think people are really supportive to each other and will always lend a hand [Music] the main idea behind my artwork is about the resilience against drought bushfires and covert it had a significant impact on our community so my artwork 's pretty symbolic it has it 's made up of pretty much all symbols and i 'll start with the one in the top left corner it 's about the face of drought and the impact it had so obviously the picture is the drought and the landscape and um the face represents how um haunting and kind of um hounding it was to people and the dark colours also represent like hell it was a bit of a dark time especially for the farmers and people that owned the land um and then the one in how the trees are all burnt and a lot of environments were lost and also the colours in the background and my artwork represents that because it 's very earthy and like a lot of the green was lost um and then in the person in the middle obviously represents an individual and the people in the community and what impact it had on them the events the covert sign represents obviously the event of covet but um the reason i put it as in it 's a punch sort of thing is because after the drought and bushfires it kind of was another advantage another issue to deal with and stuff like that but um and the dollar sign up the top that has a cross through it represents the financial loss and how it impacted not just individuals but also companies and the mainly the farmers and all the money we lost with covert and stuff and then the last symbol which is down the bottom right i believe is probably the most significant is because it 's the tree grown from the rocks and that represents regrowth yep i think the thing that makes communities be strong is definitely support by each other and supporting each other and coming together and if you know someone 's struggling like even financially you donate or you do fundraisers for it or even um yeah just coming to supporting each other and doing stuff to help each other well i like about taking photos that you might you might get good ones some days you might get bad ones sometimes you might get middle ones you know it depends on if you got the right day or not uh i like to photograph mostly stars sometimes even apparently at paramedics short uh it 's basically where you take three photos one over there one over there one over there uh some because they you might see like only one or two in like parks and some days you might find like i 'm like a hundred out of town i 've never seen anything special except for a shooting star uh so you basically might see a stove there that might be coming down it might say another over there bit is it 's when it comes down very quick and you 're gonna make sure you make a wish well i mostly do it because there 's no people distracting you like if i was going at baron i was going to take pictures of the river uh people just come in the middle of you and like kayaks will just ruin your photos straight away that 's why i like just taking stuff from him things but nobody knows it all uh yes i did enjoy being part of this competition i 'll definitely do it again if i had a chance so we basically just like if we see a million like over 100 stars we just get a tripod and a camera out and then we basically some olden day in the front of it so and then we just get photos and photos and photos of top of it and we stuck them all together and that 's what all the lines are uh most buns i enjoy are the milky way because once you add more and then you print them off they look i had jet well i think the natural world is more important now than ever particularly in the context of climate change we 're seeing a lot of alterations to said natural world and i think people are starting to realize the importance of that sense of awe that sense of being connected to our environment a sensible is very important i think i 've been reading a book recently called phosphorescence particularly about or and the mental health benefits of it for starters the sense of well-being sense of all brings lowered i think lowered senses of depression and anxiety from what i remember and it 's just important in the arts in general it 's what romanticism was founded on it 's what people have drawn inspiration from for centuries the arts has helped me immeasurably for a very long time i 've been a dancer for about 13 years now i started when i was three years old and in every hard period of my life in every struggle dance has been a sanctuary for me and the same thing with writing i think in the end you 're struggling to find a sense of self or comprehend some very confusing emotions that ability to communicate cannot be understated well teaching dance has been a very steep learning curve for me particularly in the teaching department because the kids that we take on some of them are two and a half to three years old so managing kids has been quite difficult but it 's been very valuable for me in sense of watching a kid try really hard to get a certain move or understand a certain concept and then they finally start getting it or you see the movement and seeing the pride on a kid 's face is really really valuable i have collaborated with a number of other artists as in high school artists and stuff and it 's very important particularly in a rural setting it 's been a bit hard to do that last year i was lucky enough to be selected for work experience at sydney theatre company and bell shakespeare and coming from a school where i haven 't had the opportunity to have a proper drama class it care about the arts as much as i do to have that opportunity to act with other kids to reimagine scenes and construct sets and all of that it was it was invaluable yeah well there 's no doubt that it is harder to be involved in the arts or work in the arts in a small community but yeah that sense of support in a smaller community i don 't think you get that as much in a city particularly in a more competitive environment when you 're being paid by contract or just trying to get jobs well taking opportunities is obviously very important for advancing your own skills and just advancing a sense of well-being and accomplishment we are it is hammered into us a lot that we should seize opportunities particularly at our high school and i have tried to do that sometimes you have to seek them out for yourself though which can be difficult but there 's no doubt they 're there for whatever kind of skill set you have i wondered deep and gentle faults of light catch the dry and spotted leaves breath from ruin i watched time runs his hand through this sunlight thick and gluggy custard air drags his fingers and creates ripples that slice in flashes of the past memories born of other minds i faltered the sun had fallen like that ancient devil to the earth his flattened face smeared the ground with red the leaves to each own fiery halo raised and threw themselves like fallen stars from trees i lingered flash forward now to wanderings through the graves stones the blackened earth but as i watch the hateful light falls on new leaves stubborn sticks that jut from black and ghostly trunks ignorant of the firestorm that birthed them time it seems is nudging us we watched the wattle burn you _"

    "text": "i 'm so pleased today to launch the art of resilience documentary this year 2020 has been a year like no other what a challenging time it 's been devastating summer bush fires floods drought and now the global covert 19 pandemic at a time where many events and projects have been cancelled it is absolutely fantastic to see this one going ahead showcasing all your creative talent and there 's a lot of creative talent out there this project champions the youth of the parks shire what a fabulous show that is great local government area it encourages creativity starting with conversations around drought resilience allowing a diverse range of people to get involved and highlighting the importance of the arts in wellbeing and mental health so so important a total of 130 entries were received across the park shire with 24 winners and highly commended awardees and i congratulate each and every one of them a total of 11 more entrants were awarded a special mention awardees were introduced onto a fully equipped film set how exciting would that have been something very few had the opportunity to winning entries were developed using animation graphic and sound techniques into stories to create individual film clips how exciting which was then compiled into the micro documentary you are about to watch so the only thing stopping you between watching that is my little speech here but i really want to say thank you to all those involved congratulations to the winners and enjoy this showcase of their hard and amazing work well done well it 's my great pleasure to support and congratulate all those involved in the art of resilience this project was started by roger kittson our drought support officer during the worst drought that this town has seen in many many years and it was a way of trying to support the youth of our community and using art as an outlet for them to express their feelings the drought was only one part of the the scenario for the youth about shire because we also had covered 19 come in and they also witnessed the terrible bushfires right along the coasts of new south wales and australia generally and so a lot of pressure on forms of art forms to express their feelings and able to to get it out of their system so that they are able to achieve some mental health stability in their lives and give some creativity and ways of expressing themselves beyond the the hardships that they were facing hello my name is sean james cassidy and i 'm the director of the australian chapter of ulbo exchange ultima exchange is an international art group set up to support and give voice to artists in regional areas it was created to share ideas to mentor and to strengthen the youth so that they one day can provide the same guidance and leadership to others hi my name 's roger kitson and i was a former drought response officer for park shire currently i 've moved to esk up on up in queensland to assist councillors up here with bushfire recovery it wasn 't long after i moved to parks that i could see that art was an important part of the community and i 'd always wanted to try and utilise the skills that people had there in a really writer for uberbo exchange and one of the producers of the art of resilience project i have always had a deep interest in the arts and throughout my career as a teacher i sought to engage my students with the arts i believe they 're absolutely vital for human well-being and throughout my career i 've witnessed its importance its ability to engage struggling learners sparking creativity and giving children a voice i know from from past experience that i 've had working with disadvantaged youth that art can be used as a way for healing for people to express themselves get things off their chest that 's hard for them to often often say i guess or vocalize but it 's also a great way for people to feel connected and feel like that they have a sense of purpose i guess a sense of place and that they 're a part of the community i am a resident of the park shire it 's a rural community in central west new south wales we 've had years of crippling drought and this has created enormous stresses on farming in general many of the businesses and livelihoods in a town like parks are dependent on a successful farming year so add to that the bushfires and then covert 19 times were very worrying through neighbourhood central we were approached by roger kitson the drought response officer to create a competition that would help support the known talent in the area and discover new talent within the park shire this was an opportunity to use art to connect with and give youth a voice at a time of isolation it was through neighbourhood central that i was put in touch with uber bow and it 's been a great experience working with sean kerry and jason now they took on this idea and and really raised it to a whole new level and it really is credit to them that this program uh has has come to the the success that it has in every hard period of my life in every struggle dance has been a sanctuary for me and the same thing with writing i think in the end it 's just about communication especially in a time or comprehend some very confusing emotions that ability to communicate cannot be understated the art of resilience has uncovered a wealth of artistic talent in the park shire and while some young people are facing significant struggles they were all hopeful for the future and then the last symbol which is down the bottom right i believe is probably the most significant is because it 's the tree grown from the rocks and that represents regrowth and obviously the resilience we all had and came together they all had dreams they all had goals and they also display that sometimes elusive quality that is so important for coping in an ever-changing world resilience it 's been an absolute privilege to work with the youth of the park shire thank you i got the idea from what i would see on the farm and what i would see out in the paddock and sometimes it might be a cow head or a sheep that 's passed away and i 'd get some inspiration from that and see new life grown from that and that 's where i got the idea for flowers that you would find just out in the bush in the scrub and just drew them with a bit of color growing out of the skull they are important the cycles that because when something old passes something new and beautiful grows from it which is great to watch the reason that i 'm up here on top of a mountain is because that 's the way it was described to me by the participants and the parents that were involved they said after working with uber bow they felt like that they are on top of the world so i thought this was a good place to be i 'd like to thank government and local council for their backing the schools within the park shire the park services club for the use of their facilities neighborhood central and to the families of the park shire cheers and thank you i definitely think that art is a language and it 's because i expresses your emotions when you 're thinking you 're talking but art is basically everywhere so you 're expressing your emotions almost anywhere you _"

    "text": "in 2009 the communities which make up park Shaw came together and developed a vision it was a vision of progress of transport hubs vibrant communities opportunity learning and healthy lifestyles so in May we started by doing community consultation we spoke to over 20 groups across the shower representing nearly 700 people we developed a large list of projects which the community really wanted to see done over the term of the new council some of which we could afford some of which we were providers for facilitators and advocates and some which we couldn 't afford so then in September 2012 we did a survey we looked at the things that were very important to the community and on the list you 'll see the local roads water food food safety public toilet sewer are among the top ten very important issues we also looked at the things that were very satisfied with libraries festivals park sewage were amongst the top 10 of things that the community was very satisfied with so over that over the survey period we collected over a thousand surveys and what that showed community really wanted us to do and to continue to do if not do do them more frequently and better so there wasn 't a lot of opportunity to put our resources in other areas roads and footpaths were by far the biggest area that needed work so then in September we elected a new council and now we 're looking at together putting together a four-year delivery plan the new council was was is now in place and operational the four-year delivery plan needs to reflect the communitys views but also to be fiscally responsible so the current situation is somewhat unbalanced you can see that we have an income of twenty four point nine million dollars of which eight million dollars is rates we have it we have a expenditure of twenty seven point two million dollars including six point six million dollars of depreciation now depreciation as you may know is the measurement of a deterioration of an asset I think the electricity industry is an industry where we 've seen where money wasn 't put away for depreciation and as a consequence we 've seen very avoid so without if we 're not funding depreciation you 'll end up with asset decline so in the current situation you can see that income is below expenditure and into the future that means a gap and our assets will continue to deteriorate we can 't we have no new money for capital expenditure and our operating deficit remains if we look at that over the long term going back from up to about two thousand and one you can see that the expenditure and their income start to diverge there was also the global financial crisis intervened in the general Fung parks council lost in the order of six million dollars in the general fund now would that have prevented the need for us to do anything it doesn 't if we 're losing 2.2 million dollars a year in terms of operational deficit you 'll see that six million dollars really only delays the inevitable by a few years we did however take it to the federal court of australia and of one now on two occasions against one of the biggest banks in the world so certainly the court case have indicated our staff in terms of their investment decisions now why is those lines diverging you can see that rate pegging has been pegged at around three percent for 35 years now we 've had wages going at about four percent we 've had total emergency services going up around eight percent electricity forty-two percent manufacturing costs seven to eight percent fuel which affects that a road building costs thirteen percent still fifteen percent telecommunications eight to ten percent that 's not considering now the flow-on of the carbon tax or the the effect of cost shifting from other levels of government on to our count on to our councils which was measured back in 2008-9 as being in the order of 444 million dollars across the state equivalent to five point seven percent increase the other things that we 're facing is an increase in edmonds in expectations of the community footpaths which were once narrowing and mega are now need to be wider to accommodate the new types of mobility vehicles at our road network was built for small trucks now needs to doesn 't accommodate high productivity vehicles which we 're trying to now address we 've got a road network which is some 2,500 kilometers long equivalent of driving from parks to Cannes playgrounds used to be simple there now complex and it becomes very difficult to meet these expectations as without a growth of income New South Wales treasure has also analyzed our books they 've determined that 51.7 percent of our income is derived from our own sources such as rates whereas it should be wrapped more closer to 60 percent however because we 're a sparse Shire that 's not too serious our employee costs have been controlled to about 4.1 percent reduced from the previous year saying showing good cost controls and a fine instrument in financial management has been strong in that we 've had the appropriate debt-to-equity raising however we have got a 33 million dollar backlog in assets and 475 million in total assets and compared to benchmark ratios we 're under investing on those assets a continuation of which is likely to increase the backlog we have good reserves however most of those reserves however only five point four percent of those are available to the general fund for unrestricted use our staff are staffing levels have been kept relatively stable compared to other councils group 11 Council average is 147 staff we 're 151 so we 're not overly stuffed and each one of our staff are producing approximately 140 thousand dollars worth of service and infrastructure if you divide the total of expenditure by the total total amount of staff and that was in 2001 now in 2011 12 that 's around 230,000 dollars so there 's been genuine performance improvements in terms of our rating situation the component of the rates that we 're talking about is the residential rate here you can see a property in Rose Street parks where the residential rate is around 662 dollars so what 's our average residential rate across parks in 2009 10 which is the last officially published figures our average residential rate was 486 dollars compared for example to gabon which was 510 Wellington which is 554 Forbes which is 760 TT and orange over a thousand so on average our average for over 35 years the 2009-10 farmland rate for parks was fifteen hundred and forty two dollars compared with Forbes Caban and Lachlan which were about 2,100 duh buh duh buh at around 2500 out to narrow minded 2700 similarly the business rate in parks in 2009-10 was 1823 narromine Wellington Lachlan and Coburn were less Forbes dubbo and orange were more so we 've had 35 years of rate pegging with a residential rate twenty percent below the average another other costs skyrocketing as well as expectations increasing as a consequence we really need to do something so we 're proposing another two options the static delivery plan which essentially stabilizes the situation and the progressive delivery plan firstly the static plan what we 're proposing is that over during the static plan over the next four years we would increase the residential rate by ten percent a year for for the four years that 's essentially seven percent over the CPI which we 're suggesting will be around three percent so what that does is brings income in line with expenditure over the term of this council us to bring depreciation back under control and we can start to invest in our existing assets and that 's largely what we heard from the community when we were talking to them that our current assets need to be addressed and and brought up to a current standard however there 's no money for new assets under this program so the impact on our residential rate just applying the CPI which was said to assumed at three percent be the average residential rate in parks would rise to around six hundred dollars with the additional seven percent on top of that would rise to seven hundred and seventy dollars so in the first year that would be a rise of around about sixty nine cents a week out to about a dollar to over the four-year period totaling in the last year to around three dollars 43 above CPI that 's less than a copy a week for four dollars a quarter 179 dollars a year real increase that 's over and above CPI so what have we done to reduce the impact on our pensioners we 're proposing the pensioner rebate from twenty by twenty dollars in the first year through to around seventy dollars in the fourth year which would reduce the impact on the minimum rate payer virtually completely or the real impact on our average rate payer so the impact of of CPI back from three dollars 45 a week to around two dollars 11 a week in terms of the farmland rating under CPI would increase normally over the next four years to 1891 dollars that would go up to around 20 467 or roughly equivalent to a tire on a court or a two ton of a pw one that 's ten dollars 97 a week or 142 dollars a quarter the business rate under the normal CPI would increase to around twenty two hundred and thirty-seven dollars that would increase to with the additional seven percent to around twenty nine hundred dollars around about three cups of coffee a week twelve dollars 98 a week or 168 dollars a quarter so what do we actually get if we do apply this increase so three dollars 45 for the average residential property then 's nearly 6.3 million dollars over the four years which would be directed to things like airport improvements we intend to top up the town improvement boats to allow the communities to actually make some decisions and for themselves around the infrastructure that they 'd like to see improve but it 's really about footpaths roads and drainage we 've also provided some money for weeds to improve the pools and for some sporting ground improvements so the static delivery plan doesn 't provide for any new assets however the progressive delivery plan does provide some opportunity for us to do some new things into the future over and above addressing this decline in our assets so you can see by this graph that the income now rises above expenditure and a surplus system is created that then allows over the next four years for us to address things like depreciation of our assets but also generates some new assets now to do that it 's the equivalent we need to apply an increase of around thirteen percent a year for the next four years if CPI is three percent a year for the next four years so what 's that mean in terms of our average residential rate when that increase is applied so with the normal 3% CPI it would take it up to six hundred dollars as we mentioned before if we then apply the additional or the real increase of ten percent a year for the four years that takes us up now to 865 dollars for the average residential property in the first year that means it 's around a dollar of dollar a week up to around a dollar fifty eight in the fourth year or five dollars a 12 overall that 's equivalent to bit over four liters of milk or just over one large cup of coffee assuming a large cup of coffee doesn 't increase over that period five dollars twelve a week or sixty seven dollars a quarter two hundred and sixty eight dollars a year would be the the real increase over and above CPI to mitigate the impact on there on the pensioners we 've again proposed a 25 a year rebate in the first year up to real five dollar 12 increase to the average dollar average residential property down to three dollars 13 for the Penta for pensioners if you 're on the minimum the minimum rate that would mean two dollars 19 would come back to around 90 cents a week in terms of the farmland rating under CPI we would go up to around eighteen hundred and ninety-one dollars so that 's the normal increase if you like apply the ten percent then for the four years it takes the average farm land right up to twenty seven hundred and forty seven dollars we 're now that 's the equivalent around 1.8 truck ties or three ton of a pw that would be around two hundred and twelve dollars a quarter or eight hundred and fifty dollars a year similarly to business and the CPI would gulped around twenty two hundred dollars thirty two hundred dollars would be the real increase above CPI meaning two hundred and fifty dollars a quarter around a thousand dollars a year so for the increase what does the actual actually the community get for the five dollars twelve there we get an increase of 9.3 million dollars of assets which had to be distributed in accordance with the desires of the community so around 345 thousands given back to the pensioners to reduce the impact on them airport improvements is important because we 've got an aged lighting system along the runway which we don 't want to file and we need to replace that we also see work to be done on the terminal building in the car park the town improvement votes need to be topped up which will allow the communities to actually make some decisions themselves about where they want to see their infrastructure upgraded the footpaths get a major injection we would see under the progressive program footpaths in the main streets of tullamore trundled pqm and considerable work done in parks would also start to address footpaths around some of the age precincts and the schools streets and roads get a significant injection of funds for example an extra eight hundred thousand dollars would go into our result program which will allow the reefs or program to reduce from a currently around reduce reseals of roads to Round 15 years then that stops the ingress of water and makes a significant difference to our network gravel root gravel receding is increased and so as maintenance grading all of which contribute significantly to our road network and of course we will address as best we can on a rolling basis the improvements needed to allow our be double access right throughout the shower so what 's the cost to move from the static delivery plan to the progressive delivery plan we heard earlier that is around three dollars 45 for the average residential property around five dollars 12 under the progressive plan so if we look at those sequentially the for the average residential property it 's around a dollar 67 a week to move real increase to move to the from the static to the progressive it 's around five dollars 40 for the average property and around six dollars 37 or a business we took this information to the community along with some other information on roads and drainage and footpaths and during a two-hour presentation the communities were able to about the current current delivery plan we talked about the static delivery plan which balances income and expenditure and then the progressive delivery plan which actually seeks to provide some additional funds for some new asset assets as a consequence of that we then asked that community those community groups to vote six percent thought the current situation was satisfactory sixteen percent elected for the for the static delivery plan and seventy-eight for the progressive delivery plan thank you for watching the presentation I hope it 's been useful in explaining council situation and what we 're proposing as delivery plans for the next four years of your newly elected council _"

    "text": "the park Shire was one of 60 local government areas deemed eligible for the 1 million dollars in funding under the Australian Government 's drought communities program extension to support communities impacted by drought the funding has facilitated the delivery of six community priority projects standpipe upgrades as well as the appointment of the shai 's drought response officer the initial impacts of the droughts obviously affected the farmers and shears and contractors etc but in the prolonged effects of the drought as has really affected the entire community and the whole agribusiness sector the purpose of the role was to collect and disseminate relevant drought information throughout the whole community and to provide a coordinated approach to a drought response the park Shire Council needed this type of supporting role too to tackle the complexities of the drought funding model and to assess and overcome obstacles that the community is facing so we can actually coordinate a positive drought response [Music] each of the villages have always had a standpipe but most of those standpipes are quite small and they 'll put in now in the past at the the funding to to review all of the existing stand pipes and and upgrade each of those probably a good example is in Pico we upgraded the stand pipe they 're sort of from 50ml to 100 mil now the fill time for a large tanker has gone from say 50 minutes to less than 10 minutes separate to that council took the decision that from the rural stand pipes if you are a rural land holder or at a rural business that we wouldn 't charge for water from those stand pipes obviously then in conjunction with the upgrade of the stand pipes that means that no one will miss out on access to that free water the existing amenities block is quite old and need to facelift but also especially with our bigger festivals where we have a lot of campers here amenities really are our a sticking point where it is we need to bring in a lot of extra amenities and I doing [Music] projects like this in the town on town infrastructure actually boosts morale in the town which is really important at the moment get a bit down in the mouth as well but when there are things happening it really does boost the town pride and that sense of community and people are really glad to be part of the community and more likely to get involved and contribute as well well prior to having with the installation of the grass and the sprinkler system it was basically cat heads and Karki would not very attractive I think the locals are very happy with this clean space it 's important to have respite from the drought if you 've got a nice garden around your house or you 've got some green war and you 've got something something that that 's alive and so this this green space I think gives everyone a shot in the arm because it 's a nice green area where children can come reply people can eat their lunch it benefits the whole community not only the farmers but the town the village people as well the hall was built in the mid 1930s it was built as a community hall and in those days before computers that stuff it was used as a dance hall or well in those years it was reputed to have the best dance floor in the district so that 's its claim well it 's in prime prime condition me up it 's just being lying here very idle for all those years which is total to become part of the community a game and get them together there are lots of little hurt wooden hotels in the morning days but this one is the only survivable Lance and it 's the town hub became the town hub and it still is or will be when we finished the only family venue in Pekin that money continued to force the counting closer to occupation a lot closer but they also did the painting and fit around it you know all the electrical wiring that 's we can 't function without it well you know we 've got lined up all the exits and all the danger things we 're supposed to have electrically wired in and now we 'll be able to do that now with your funding that wall will 's huge because we wouldn 't be able to do it without the funding this fair dinkum there 's a lot of money look the hall has a long history it 's actually 85 years old we 're back in 1934 those plaques on the wall to designate that just look it 's just a local community coming together and saying we need somewhere to get together and get together and that 's what community is all about is getting vo so these old places they are old and as you can imagine 85 years ago that the facilities etc at that time were adequate but over that period of time we 've had to continue a I guess a progressive upgrade the next issue on on the list was the amenities and they 're just there against the original amenities and they really needed to be upgraded to continue the facilitation of people getting together you know like families bringing their little children older older people have said this is probably the longest running drought that any of the present farms have experienced so we 're you know we to get a people off their farms look to you know I guess have the opportunity to talk this refurbishment it comes from trying to get a few grants over the years and being unsuccessful and then when the I mean it was a it 's a success come out of something terrible being the drought I suppose but it 's been a positive for the town it 's been a difficult time and I think we 've still got difficult times to come the drought has hit the rural areas in such a way that we probably haven 't experienced before because it 's so widespread and I think the federal government have been very generous in allowing the Shires to use the money for these type of facilities because it 's it 's getting people off their farms and having a bit of recreation as well these projects have gone a long way towards providing short-term relief by boosting local employment and procurement and addressing a number of social and community needs while local farmers remain hopeful for decent rain in August and September to break two years the state that is still drought declared

Elvis se they said this is the craziest idea we 've ever heard and I 'm gay this is gonna be a disaster so what the heck am i doing all the way out here well our story starts away back and you 'll live again swear this is bobbinet two of my biggest fans Bob and I were both Elvis fans it was he who had the first Elvis we bought most of his singles I remember once and said that I was a pretty good singer and I said would you sing something so I jumped up on the bar and I sang let me be your teddy bear I 'll think your mother thought that well actually you run anyway I think she was a bit of an Elvis fan too hey this place back in 1980 we call it Graceland spa three all this is place and was a cook and I became an instant dominant we 've had lots and lots of different parties and weddings and even wake system things you know and everyone come away with fond memories of great events but when summer came around business always took a dive in January nothing much happened in parks you were here because you either had to work or you had no money if you had any money you went on holidays and if they were here you worked and you didn 't it 's a hot time in parks and in our industry and you know which is a function Center people were running pretty low too it just happened Elvis 's birthday is in that slow time the 8th of January 1935 so I said why don 't we have a festival for all of us maybe attract people to come to the town and the tourist board said why not unfortunately most of the town 's folk hated Bob 's idea yes I 'm concerned and the plans to hold an Elvis Presley festival English fan is this the image we want I think what I saw was a big fat bloated creature he overate over drugged and he was just the describe I think it 's the wrong thing parks be talking about too many good people and tivity good things which come out of this town and district I personally don 't like the man familiar with a peak people have said that else is dead but to tell that to me well talking on deaf ears because I nothing to worry about that but there was one man in town who was sure to come to my party one more was about six seven years of age so shout Burke sang she heard the voice and saw the man that was it when we found out that the first one was on I went and saw Bob and a NAT Graceland 's and they told me that the look-alike and sound like crunk dishes were there on the Friday night yeah how could I make him a jumpsuit I said you give me a pair of trousers and a shirt and you watch me so that 's how we started actually it 's chakra because he never ever used to get dressed up for fancy dress parties or nothing but it turned out all right most I thought it did they 're not bad him would you reckon draw a raft for the personal temp when you put that suit on a change D night sad don 't you lose I 've never done him in life probably just bill would have been there for a lot of years listen doing them and much bigger than that on maybe something like that because watch it down on one of those suits it just makes you feel that you first festival we just expected a lot of Elvis fans and that 's what we got we filled both the main room and the Tiffany room we got people come over from South Australia I 'm as far away as Darwin we 've got those people from Sweden or wherever we didn 't have many local people that here Steve lenoks he was the only one with the jumpsuit in that particular year wasn 't too bad until I actually walked in the Graceland 's and saw the amount of people who the nerves sort of kick dinner said nah you 're not gonna do it in a way I was I was frightened I just sort of nearly went to places inside himself up to do something that he 'd never done before and I suppose he he just felt funny about it when they call my name out for the competition part of our last well when I looked into the eyes of the audience just gather the feeling this has happened to go on it was just fantastic the way that crowd reacted when he come out the shell again the crowds are on again say that because she have a bit worn it was pretty good everyone else had sports clothes or bright shirts or black t-shirts or something he sort of started the jumpsuit pink lo and behold I was the winner of the first year so I was very proud of it we had a good night on the Friday night at Graceland pretty good showing at the concert at the league 's club everybody had a great time everybody been declared I won 't be back next year and we thought that you know that was good we thought this was pretty good stuff when we 're doing a pretty good job yep we all had fun but why didn 't the locals come we didn 't even stay in town we were at the beach and we stayed at the beach and wait for it all the sort of settle down I think the first year I didn 't even realize was like you know it 's pretty well caning went without sort of even causing a bit of a ripple on the street parade pretty meek and mild you know a couple of cars just drive down the street with it for the few people half dressed with a bit of a week and that 's everything yeah we just stayed in sconce Turner home on the farm and we didn 't come in probably no we just went involved at all in spite of all the party poopers steve noticed a strange thing happening when I walked in straight afterwards and people who call Afghan a straight guy Elvis net no I thought who saw well well no I don 't know so I went to the Justice place office here and within a couple of months I got and you birth certificate back we 'd changed night lady more named selves and the customer 75 bucks yes sir that 's the bargain but the good Lord above is about to test our faith we had a terrible round of bad Luck 's for about three or four years they 'll bushfires in the Blue Mountains if you lived with me outside the mountains it could look and get here couldn 't get the packs because they are flood waters everybody then the following year we got another pair of bushfires interest was whining for the festival it did look like a good piece we actually had to pay the entertainer every hour and funds that happened a couple times I thought many times why are we doing this I even called a little meeting and said I think this will be the last festival because I don 't want to build my head against the wall anymore it took a few years for this impact to actually get through to local people I think they could see that we were battling we needed a champion and we sure as heck got one having been an Elvis fan for most of my life I really felt that this was something that the community should should embrace I regularly wrote that we are in danger of losing something that is pretty special there was something that could be unique to parks it would be a tragedy for us to lose it our newspaper campaign got the good folks at City Hall festival probably would have fired it we decided that we 'd ask our tourist officer Kelly a consumptive to get behind the program and really see what she could do to promote it I think I latched on to it straight away in terms of a selling point for the town to have such a unique festival I felt when Kelly came on board that we 'd run the lottery actually she knew what she was doing and I was very happy I was motivated and pumped up to get involved and I was ready to assist them in stepping in the event uh partly to the next level in the early years of the event visitors would be hyped up and excited about coming to the festival and they 'd attend the great Elvis event and they might leave the event and try and head to a pub but the town had maybe a closed-down feel to it they felt a little misled that they were coming to a town where there was a big event so it was something that the committee needed to rally other people to back on our feet I was involved in a motor vehicle accident and the doctor came up and just looked me straight in eyes and and just said you know we 're gonna have to cut the fool off and just felt like a time-weighted at landed on my chest and crashed my chest and it just sort of took the wind right out of me the viol lost the foot well I would have lost me always retain me movements and things like that I may have had an artificial foot but I still wouldn 't have been decided to be able to do the routines and movements you know a sort of Guinea antelope I 'd like Elvis history isn 't that so I was in hospital for about three days he 's went my way and went aside that the key that foot and put a skin grafts and that honor when I got home I said you know I ain 't gonna sit around and let the grass grow under my chair or under me I said I 'm gonna force myself back on the B I 'm training for a spot you got a text I added and you 've got to be tough I was determined to give meself MacOS classic dawat awash with Elvis Linux sidelined we got a hand from some unexpected players yeah when we first brought up the idea of taking in the Elvis Festival I thought it was a great idea obviously we 've seen the opportunity there to sort of bring a lot of grog and dress-up and silly clothes so that was right down our alley in the Euro that I sort of started coming through the rugby community there was probably eight or ten guys who were all around that same age group or being single men at the time we saw Boston to form the gentlemen 's club and they have a few different activities through the year well you still always make sure we were dressed in our finery and most the time that was a proper dinner suit and one of the meetings we decided that it would be good to sort of embrace the Elvis Festival business of rising from the last festival I think we 've got the body Todd I think the boys initially got involved in the office parade purely for there 's another reason to dress up that 's right jumpsuits it 's going to be the big beach we get them in we wear them and you can 't wash them for 48 hours can 't_''_912.8 take them off can 't_''_914.28 take them up or go home and the seat must be three so all the rugby clubs around this area in the central west that they love to dress up or if they 're not dressing out the other alternative I 'm sitting that 's right it 's either get dressed up or get nude all those in favor it was my responsibility to get in Sydney and get these suits the beauty of carnosine here to pick the suits up is you always go first pick of the suits and say you can go through the bags and find out which if I look the best and you can get the best we can yeah you can really get the pick of the bucket lunch sunglasses and a week on and you have the jumpsuit on he said do look at yourself in the mirror yeah that 's not playing that 's the football team weren 't the only good folk to join our site when I first heard about the festival there were so many people in the town who were unhappy about the festival taking place here at all in the church that same attitude existed I was probably more aware of Elvis 's gospel music then I was of his other songs it was actually not a big step to think well why don 't we create a gospel service Elvis gospel service the particular congregation that is in parks very traditional Church fact none of them have anything to do with Elvis and you could sort of see their faces all changing it I mean it 's just that extraordinary memory so I don 't know what you reckon about the outside year but I think it 's possible well Tom to be blunt I thought it was a very dumb idea I really could not see a role for the for a concert he 's a pop star now I don 't think it was a regular attender I found it a little difficult to find a connection between Elvis and the service I was really not a great Elvis fan in my day the one I really liked Buddy Holly and basically they said this is the craziest idea we 've ever heard but we 'll give it a go I went out and purchased what I understood was the two best biographies of Elvis 's life I read the two books and I knew much more about of us I really wanted to know before it happened I didn 't know what this service was going to look like but I wanted to get people together just to see how it was going to look on the Sunday and it all sounded pretty ordinary and I 'm going ah this is this is gonna be a disaster so the time had come but we 're all done the best we could would it be the best festival yet or the last ever the football team just couldn 't because it 's always a city doesn 't fit well Steve we go the doji built below like even Betsy 's paints over there for example like I can 't get enough of their pain Russell what I 'm doing now is to get as drunk as we can before we have to go to dinner so we don 't say nervous when we walk in to the crowd of 300 people or nails there every picture we 've just hit something because we 're the only people dressed up in the jumpsuits for the entire weekend we 've quite a novelty you know people we drive on the street and stopping the cars and get me out taking photos an interview of papers and we sort of become mini celebrities at the same time now it 's probably something that we didn 't think about when we sat down and thought it over what 's going the office Fez now be a fun the next day we all waited to see if Reverend Tom 's prayers would be answered I didn 't think many people would turn up but 'clock and I got to church at 10 past I asked it and by the time I got down to the hall or a dozen people in the hall and it 's like we 're here for the Elvis Presley for we 've got here early so we can get the good seats we had never experienced before people arriving early to get the good sex but the great part about it was was this huge transformation since something happened overnight heaven knows but when they can ask their baby they sing in tune everything went okay maybe it was just there to cause me anxiety but it just worked overtime but the best part of the weekend was the triumphant return of Elvis Elvis Linux that is the movements were pretty well restrictive because Oscar recovering while people will very surprised to see me make in the competition that will more surprised than nothing for us if I hadn 't forced myself to do it instead of a big Michael and welcome to grumpy old man but I didn 't do that all I had the willpower to there the end of the weekend I think we all did our party was a king hit lots of folk when it come to my party now they include them most of the locals can you believe the crowd that they 've been to trying the people on the train were blown away when they saw us I 'm any box Babel on the platform welcome it 's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger the community in general I think is really embraced it the last probably three or four years something we 've always I build to be part of this tool you have to go in the braid you can see now that it 's not just a minority group China 's who fulfills some we need to have nations that they vote for dressing up as always so I think there 's a little bit of an embarrassment to be able to early on but I think because it 's becomes such a big success that the broad many are really embracing the good Lord has given his blessing to Reverend Tom 's service as well well 220 the year after that is 400 the year after that was 650 feet old is little hundred fifty people it 's made people realize the depth of what Elvis and the Elvis festival can bring it 's not just a commercial exercise _"

double cream dollop they kiss [Music] bread making for fun and profit by james roy they say that the true magic of bread is in the smell hence this advice for when you 're thinking of selling your home before you so estate agent head down to your nearest homeware store and pick up a bread maker not an expensive one just a no-name generic bread maker next wander over to the supermarket which is probably in the same shopping center just near the food court go straight to the baking aisle and grab three small boxes of bread mix white wholemeal multi grain it really doesn 't matter but not the gluten free because that 's unnecessarily expensive especially for the purposes of this exercise next head home feel free to unpack your shiny new bread maker but don 't turn it off plug it in if you must but there 's no need to fire it up yet since there are several steps place one of your three boxes of print mix beside the appliance the other two you should store in a cool dry place now you can ring your preferred realtor tell them that you want them to come and perform evaluation book a date and time but and this point is critical ask them for a specific time there 's a window to consider here a window commit to that window hang up and call another realtor this cannot be stressed strongly enough now it 's time to consult the user 's manual for the bread maker and find out how long the basic bread setting takes some bread makers have settings for heavy rye crusty artisanal beer bread pizza dough no ignore these basic is what you 're after the time given should be somewhere between two and three hours now subtract that amount of time from the expected arrival time of the real estate valuer does the reason for this need to be explained no not to anyone who has ever smelled the aroma of freshly baked bread curling out of the kitchen and into every corner of the home [Music] some signs the secret is in the way the yeast multiplies and grows to fill the thousands of chambers within the dough that first language bite into fresh bread isn 't really about the taste of the glutinous fibres but rather those pockets of aroma being pressed by the tongue against the hard palate and bursting releasing hundreds of tiny explosions of warm consolation this moment a moment that emanates from the offerings of european bakeries and patisseries from campfire fresh damper from nani afghani ethiopian and jira tortillas and naan it 's doubtful that the effect this has on the listed price of one 's home has ever been properly quantified this makes perfect sense since the taste and smell and texture and social effects of good food are not quantifiable nor should they be to attempt such an exercise would be to risk breaking the spell of course it will not have been lost on the observant viewer that these instructions required a second and third box of bread mix it seems to go without saying that the second is for the morning of the open house now let 's talk about coffee oh i almost forgot the third box of bread mix isn 't it obvious leaving a much loved family home is an emotional event you 're going to need support [Music] you _"

    "text": "lake parramatta what an amazing place [Music] [Music] this is hunts creek where our journey begins and i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of this land the durag people and any aboriginal torres strait islanders that are connected to parramatta this it 's a special place lots of wildlife and so many people it 's this damn wall which was built in 1856 using sandstone quarry directly from hunts creek that has created lake parramatta it 's the whole reason that we 've got all the beautiful bushland around here it protects it and it 's why the wildlife 's here and it 's such a beacon for so many people and it 's the first dam actually built in australia and it 's here in parramatta pretty special and down here below it it just feels awesome so what i love about lake parramatta is that it 's just such a biodiverse area we 've got the water habitat the terrestrial habitat and we just have so many different animals so many different plants here and it 's just a cool place to be a lot of the lga it 's the largest conserved fragment of bushlands in the lga area about 75 hectares it 's special you know you can come here have a 4.1 k walk if you want it 's a circuit around the lake parramatta um reserve or you can just go to a little rocky outcrop look at the water look at the animals and and relax at the beginning of the lake circuit track you 've got a good bush tucker garden i really like this spot because this bush struck a guard it 's a bit of connection to the traditional custodian 's land use how the aboriginal people use the plants for food fibre and medicine and i love it right here you 've got sandpaper fig that 's a great edible down there you 've got the spiny headed matte rush now that was used to weave daily bags and over there is a native hibiscus which is now used believe it or not to put great flavor in australian sparkling wine the great thing about where it starts is this whole reserve is full of native plants are obviously and there 's lots of discoveries to be made for food fibre or future medicine now my hat really goes off to the bush key community here at lake parramatta and the reason for that is these groups have a great opportunity they get off the beaten path they get into the sticks and into the weeds they 're pulling out weeds they 're putting plants in the ground and they 're taking care of this great space what bush cares about is about connecting to people that are like-minded you 're meeting people that you enjoy to have good conversations with but what i love is they take care of one of these majestic trees and this beautiful landscape and it doesn 't just stop here some of them even get in the water they 're out there on kayaks they 're removing aquatic weeds and they 're having a great splash of its own i mean really it 's a good thing i really encourage you to get out here and take care of it our volunteers like make such a massive difference removing weeds from remove tons and tons every year so in terms of wildlife we 're always trying to build habitat for our animals so that 's definitely our main aim in bush care at lake parramatta we 've got a wide variety of bird life lots of water birds we also have sugar gliders kidners wallabies so we 've got a wide variety of animals so our volunteers are lucky enough to be able to spend quality time with the animals down here definitely one of the perks of bush care volunteering so volunteers do make an incredible difference we have about 10 000 plants planted in the reserves by our volunteers each year another 10 000 plants planted at just national tree day alone so that 's 20 000 plants from parramatta volunteers every single year the bush care group makes a huge difference here and across the rest of parramatta we have about 39 40 groups all up so it 's it 's great we have over 300 volunteers and they make a huge difference to parramatta bushland once people having that conscious that we should care for the bush is brilliant and everybody can make a difference so i do implore people to get involved come out on these days like it 's a great time you can get to kayak you get to paddle there 's people here that will teach you their techniques have a good time and make a positive difference to your community i think it 's a haven for people as well as wildlife it 's just a great place to come along and hang out and splash about and yeah and then doing the bush care part of it you just know that you 've not just come down and splashed about but you 've actually increased the value of the place in terms of helping the environment in this place there 's a real diversity there 's a diversity of people there 's a diversity of animals diversity of plants and the diversity of ecosystems parramatta has a lot of endangered ecological communities best one represented here is the sydney turpentine iron bark forest that also has a small representation of blue gums the eucalyptus selignans and then throughout the rest of and also eucalyptus pepperita the crushed leaves is really aromatic and fragrant and it was actually utilized by the first colony as an antiseptic eucalyptus oil first came from the eucalyptus pepperida some of which are beautiful and large in this reserve what 's special about the old growth eucalyptus trees the gum trees is that they provide habitat for sugar gliders microbats possums and of course a lot of bird species so if we don 't have those old growth eucalyptus trees we don 't have those species those animals so it 's very important that we protect these trees they 're important for the ecosystem here i just had to go get my camera i 've come down to this lizard lounge and i 've met so many interesting characters up there in the crack there 's a little eastern water stick she 's been sitting there chewing out looking over the lake and down here beside the water 's edge it 's been beautiful i 've met a whole family of water dragons there 's been this big male bright red chest he 's been on the there are little baby water dragons all through here and they 're all full of personality and just sitting here gives me the opportunity to interact with them or they interact with me they know i 'm here and i get to see their natural behaviours head bobs and push-ups doing more interesting things and those sort of opportunities are all through this reserve and the other day i couldn 't believe it i 'm walking along this kidding with totals on right in front on the path got very very excited i 've got my camera out and i 'm lying down the grass and i sort of anticipated where the kid was going to walk to and it was right up to me i 've had this beautiful experience this interaction with this kid i just got to watch it see what 's happening and what was astonishing is people just walked on right beside the kid and i in the grass and i didn 't even know we were there ah there 's another water dragon down there [Music] people can help i respect lake parramatta by here and we leave here with what we bring we can also respect lake paramount reserve by following some very simple rules keeping dogs on leads staying on the track is also important so we don 't have impacts widening tracks and damaging native plants so we just want people to understand that this is a home for our native wildlife we have our homes you know in the city and this is the home for our native wildlife and we need to protect it for them and make it a safe spot we don 't want people going through the home of these native animals and disturbing it and making it uncomfortable for them because then they have nowhere else to go this place is shared space and for me lake parramatta that 's what it symbolizes i love coming here it 's hemmed in by people 's homes a road and yet it 's a corridor for wildlife there 's so many different species using here because it 's got habitat it 's got plant diversity it 's got a lake and i love how people use this cafe there 's lots of amenities puts people back into the natural world gives me hope for the future they 've done something right here _"

it 's critically endangered 0.5 wrestlemania now vineyard creek in the path along it cuts to a whole blend of different ecosystems coastal and rich sydney sandstone moist forest rainforest and the sydney turpentine ironbar forest with all these different communities they have a great habitat opportunities up in the canopy there are good highs down the ground the fallen timber it 's great little

going to have to come back now i 'm spot to see animals and i noticed some really special plants down here we 've got some nodding green hoods a little awkward they 've got an interesting life cycle very symbolic relationship with fungus nuts that do the pollinating for them that 's what 's really cool about here this place and the plants here have been taken care of by the bush kit if it wasn 't_''_97.119 for the longest running bush care group in parramatta vineyard creeks bush care a lot of this stuff wouldn 't exist it could easily have been overrun by weeds and they 've done a great job we meet once a month for three hours and we we talk we dig out weeds we plant we solve all the world 's problems it 's a social thing as well as doing something for the bush you met new friends and obviously people doing bush care are similar interest to you even you don 't know anything about plants and native come come to our group i mean you learn a lot yeah i 've learned a lot i 've learnt different types bird species it really is good therapy it 's good for the soul it 's a fabulous thing to do because it just gives you something to look forward to once a month coming down and joining with your friends having some weeding some planting having some morning tea it just makes your day so yeah i encourage everybody to do volunteering if they get the chance these in bush gear fantastic now with this bit of rain i 've come down to the dam because the duck action down here is really good i 've been watching the australian wood ducks they 've been mumming around chasing each other and i 've just seen specific black ducks having a feed on some water plants and through vineyard creek reserve the brushed turkeys are on point i 've watched a big male building this mound because they incubate their eggs in a composting mound getting ready for the breeding season i 've seen some other brushed turkeys just milling around turning over the leaf litter hunting little insects and worms decomposing the leaves which is great because it releases nutrients of fire by getting rid of that fine fuel layer and some of the fallen timber down around here it 's got lots of life living underneath it things like little insects and then funky breaking it down which is also part of the nutrient cycle helping this place work down on the water 's edge i 've seen a couple of water dragons but you know what i reckon i reckon vineyard creek really comes to wife of the night time i 'm going to get out here with my secret weapon oh let 's see another duck ah these are a good secret weapon my thermal imaging binoculars now i thought they would have revealed a powerful air tonight i haven 't seen one but i can tell you in lots of the forks of these trees there are brushed our possums i knew there were ringtail possums here because i 've seen one of their dress the place where they sleep over daytime and i 'll tell you what was so special i got to meet some acrobats tonight i saw a sugar glide down and land on sap and then the rest of its family came and joined it and they 're acrobats they 're full of life scratching around hunting for little insects and their bing just take off and on some of the trunks of the trees you 'd see these great big huntsman spiders which are a good cockroach assassin let 's see what else is out there i 've got a bit of a heat signature torny frog mouth now most people think that tawny frog mounds are a bird of prey they 're not birds of prey catch their food with their talons they tear it up with their beaks these characters catch it with their beaks and with that big wide mouth just like a frog swallow it whole and they eat things like little insects mice frogs and anything that 'll fit down that gob of theirs and i love seeing them [Music] there 's little bits of evidence that i 'm looking for oh look at this we 've got whitewash whitewash is our poo so now has been peeling here it 's been roosting here and what it down here on the ground we 've got a bit of the wing of a gray-headed flying fox so this powerful hour most likely it would have caught this bat last night it 's eaten it a bit of the wings dropped off and that 's what they do powerful hours will catch food in the night and they 'll actually hold it in their talons through the day so that 's a bit of the evidence we 're in the right spot time to keep looking there 's still no sign of the air not even a feather yes we 've got a powerful out it 's up here it 's a turpentine i can 't volume it so many days i 'm looking for it we finally found it what a beautiful bird so big in fact it 's australia 's biggest hour incredible they catch possums it 's got no prey today against talons but often they 'll sit there hanging it through the day and they 're not very common not at all the reason it 's here is great habitat and there 's lots a great reserve and we finally found it i feel really lucky yes so our bushland reserves are so important not only for the native animals and the native plants that need a home but they 're also important for us when we 're living in a city like this we 've got busy lives we want to come out and we want to just refresh and relax and just be one with nature and then when we come out of it we just feel reinvigorated and we can get back on to our busy lives it 's just such an important place for our mental health and our physical health to have these reserves it 's all in the name vineyard creek that 's exactly what this place used to be a vineyard and look at it now it 's this beautiful chain of little reserves that connect this landscape and it 's been restored because of all the different parties taking care of it from local residents bush care and city of parramatta council teams of wildlife i can 't believe the sheer volume of animals i 've getting out here for night time oh wow the acrobats little sugar gliders possums and what i 'm so happy we got to do is we got to meet the powerful hour and we 're in tilopia this it 's a really special place _"

samuel marsden who described daniel as a very fine youth and a very handsome young man george cayley was born in 1770 in yorkshire the son of a horse dealer with little formal schooling he seemed destined to work in the stables but his curious nature and the interest in the medicinal herbs used to treat horses led him would come to define him in 1795 he wrote to sir joseph banks requesting and obtaining work as a gardener 's labourer hoping for opportunities to increase his botanical knowledge kaylee worked in various gardens over the next few years including the famous q botanical gardens he must have impressed his patron as banks appointed him as a botanical collector in new south wales at his own expense kaylee arrived in sydney aboard the speedy in 1800 upon arriving in parramatta he noted the general mode of living is very mean and wretched many having nothing but the store allowance vegetables are very scarce governor king planned to establish a botanical garden and he wanted kaley to contribute to its development king granted him government rations two convict servants and the use of a small cottage adjacent to government house kaylee set about establishing his own vegetable garden growing cabbages potatoes onions watermelon apples figs and peaches though the precise location is not known it seems from an early illustration that the nearest cottage to government house was located just here what is now known as the crescent so this agricultural high school in carlingford ex-convict richard partridge had a 60 acre grant very close to where i 'm standing in what were then known as the northern boundary farms though his equipment was somewhat more basic than what we see today he too would have been growing crops and raising livestock partridge was by this stage a constable pound keeper and carter who also happened to be the country 's hangman and famously left-handed flogger daniel malwaten was an aboriginal man of the daring nation born around 1790 to 92. he had been orphaned as an infant and was taken into the home of richard partridge as a companion for his young son samuel marsden said malwaten was of the parramatta tribe the baromatical and it seems daniel maintained strong connections to his people including biji biji who would later become a prominent elder in the community kaylee was a dedicated naturalist who amply repaid sir joseph banks 's trust in his abilities he set to work collecting plants making a particular study of orchids but his diligence and persistence in demanding the resources he needed to continue his did not win him any friends he complained about dairy cows trampling the governor 's garden believed also to be the site where his living plant collection was kept his arguments with his neighbour the prominent churchman samuel marsden of the marston 's pigs repeatedly destroying his own garden were also ongoing today kaylee 's demands seemed quite reasonable but by the standards of the times he was deemed to be a pesky upstart for daring to question his social betters indeed even his own patron banks wrote had he been born a gentleman he would have been shot long ago in a duel kaylee was also out of step with the establishment in his attitude to aboriginal people he wrote it is said that the natives of new south wales are the most idle wretched and miserable beings in the world but i could single out several that surpassed numbers of englishmen in mental qualifications though governor king had imposed official restrictions on mixing with aboriginal people kaylee quickly learnt to converse in several local languages he inquired into and valued the scientific knowledge held by aboriginal people in many of them as i can in order to learn their customs at the age of about 10 daniel malwaten went to live and work with george cayley who at first referred to him as dan from adolescence when he may have been initiated he was more often called malwaten or muwadi meaning bushpath probably by the time daniel joined him kaylee had moved from his primitive cottage to the old government farm building once located here the house was described as a weather-boarded and shingled dwelling have an extensive garden under cultivation by 1805 muwatten being able to speak multiple aboriginal languages and with cultural knowledge was working as cayley 's interpreter guide servant and companion on expeditions around sydney one of malwaton 's greatest contributions to scientific knowledge was to provide cayley with the means to begin his pioneering studies of the eucalypts in order to classify plants botanists needed to access their leaves bark fruits and flowers with eucalypts being large trees kaley could not reach them now malwaten an accomplished climber of trees assisted kaylie with accessing the necessary examples kaley labelled such specimens with got the darrig names and uses for these eucalypts along with other plants and animals unknowingly helping to preserve important elements of his culture for example the sydney blue gun was called kalang aura the black butt taran daya and the sydney red gum or angophra was nadang aura [Music] the governor wrote to banks that kaley would have the use of government house of parramatta which was rarely occupied by the governors of the time to dry his botanical specimens kaylee 's modest hut admitted too much wind to allow this [Music] kelly and marwaten would have used a wooden plant press to aid in drying and pressing their specimens [Music] the space in government house was possibly also used in preserving the animal specimens they had collected [Music] in july 1805 malwaton and kaylee went on an exploratory expedition to the cow pastors area then in october they sailed aboard the ship sydney to norfolk island aiming to collect living plant and animal specimens for banks on norfolk island they collected 22 new plant species after a few weeks they continued to ban demons land where they stayed until or mount wellington collecting alpine plants they also managed to catch an echidna something that banks had been requesting for some time but echidnas are notoriously hard to keep hold of and it escaped in january 1807 another plant collecting expedition took them north from parramatta to the coast at narrabeen in addition to gathering plant specimens muwatten 's skills as a bird and animal trapper were invaluable to cayley from the time daniel joined him kaylee started to use darrek names for animals when he described them to banks in july cayley sent mulatton out in search of a koala to send to banks kelly heard disturbing news that malwaten had been speared in the thigh and killed kelly was later relieved to report to banks that notwithstanding this severe wound he very soon recovered though the quest was not a success malwaten 's report of a great waterfall he had found encouraged kaylee to join him on a further expedition to the cataract river and appen gorge which kailey named cataract of kuran guring on the river muwatan the cascade i shall call muwaten to commemorate the memory for the discovery of the cataract but for causing me to undertake the journey whereby other discoveries were made in 1808 kaylee described muwatten as the best interpreter of the more inland native languages than any i have met with i can place that confidence in him which i cannot in any other all except him are afraid to go beyond the limits of the space which they inhabit and i know this one would stand by me until i fell if attacked by strangers kaylee later said of aboriginal people if they had intended me any mischief where was there one more exposed to them it may be asked how i gain their affections to this i answer by never taking any advantage of them and never forfeiting my word in 1808 banks released kaylee from his botanical responsibilities kelly had been homesick for a long time and was weary of the constant struggle to attain scientific basics he 'd also for some time been requesting permission to bring malwaten back to england with him believing that he would benefit from some formal education though banks had not responded him anyway in 1810 kailey marwaten and fellow nurseryman george sutter boarded the hindustan bound for england they brought with them kaylee 's pet cockatoo and a wealth of natural history specimens including 700 bird and animal skins and an array of live and preserved plants after previous visits to england by aboriginal and islander people had been less than successful it was now government policy to discourage such practice so when they finally arrived after a difficult six-month voyage the watten was confined to the ship in woolwich for the entire winter while kaylee tried to find a sponsor for his orderly conduct presumably kaylee was not considered enough of a gentleman to take this responsibility eventually banks who did not approve of the visit relented and stood guarantor later banks requesting a passage for malwaten back to the colony referred to kaylee as injudicious for having brought him to england he was only the third aboriginal person to set foot in britain george sutter finally brought malwaten to kaley in january 1811. the first thing kaylee did was to have malwaton inoculated against smallpox and he was taken visited kew gardens where a cabbage tree palm specimen previously sent by kali was already thriving new watan was also taken to meet the president of the royal society explorer matthew flinders and to pay visits to ex-governor bly and the botanist robert brown both of whom he would have known from parramatta he lived for a year with joseph banks assisting kaylee and robert brown with the botanical work he even joined kaylee on at least one occasion at the court-martial of lieutenant colonel george johnson for the coup against governor bly while away from home he frequented theaters and public houses and took up drinking which led to a split with kaylee who was so angry at this development that he assaulted malwaten breaking his own son in the process in 1811 malwaten who had always maintained that the woods of his country were finer than anything england had to offer returned to sydney in the company of nurseryman george sutter but without kaylee who remained in england he stayed on sutter 's farm in baucom hills for a few weeks but then departed into the bush [Music] on good terms together they had achieved much a collection of over 700 animal specimens being mainly birds but with many previously unknown to western science the first preserved examples of many australian plant species including pioneering work on orchids and eucalypts exploration and mapping of parts of the sydney basin recording daring names and knowledge of many plants and animals their significant cross-cultural scientific partnership would not be rivaled for over 200 years though now of course scientists regularly seek aboriginal cultural knowledge in areas as diverse as archaeology biology and land management practices [Music] um you _"

portrait of you in the library somewhere sure is that okay i think maybe over there when there 's like nice kind of soft lighting yeah yeah probably not the best idea to shake hands because you know the times were in but yeah i would otherwise take your hand um okay so we should sure sit here oh maybe i might sit you in the blue chair here take a seat just be comfortable yeah just be comfortable yeah just sit how you how you normally sit actually come i might get you to sit on that on that set there because i 'm liking the light in that corner just right here just this one yeah i like i like how you 're sitting here can you move your arm maybe just have your hands place there just go back a little bit actually no is to like get them not to pose you know because otherwise if you get them to pose they 're like i want my dog move my leg that here i 'm here like that you know maybe maybe not you know so just to relax yeah i 'm gonna move this pop plant behind you a little bit just stay where you are it 's just shifting it so little details that you notice after you take a photo you 're like i wish i 'd moved that pot plant while i had the time you know now i have to try to photoshop it and it 's like it takes you an hour to do it but you could have done it in two seconds but yeah okay you know take a few shots this is a kill by the way he 's doing me photographing you amazing behind the scenes yeah i might get another close-up i put your chin down a little bit yeah now just look at me yeah that 's good ah okay there 's a very small flash you stay there i 'm different angles i can take this head um i really find that nerve-wracking is not something i naturally do especially you know especially if it 's on the street you just see a stranger that 's for some reason you want to photograph them and it 's really awkward it 's a really awkward situation you know because you have to introduce yourself you have to try to make them try to comfortable relax and sort of believe that you 're not going to be you know you 're not some creep so and really to get all that across in like a couple of seconds it 's really difficult you know um it 's a real skill some people have a a technique or a a a kind of a thing that they want to say you know i don 't have that you know a script that they 're ready with the pitch you know but sometimes you just come across someone and it 's so striking or it 's not that person it 's that person and the environment you know somehow they just go together you if you don 't ask them you 'll regret for the rest of your life you know you 're like oh you 're always thinking about oh i should have asked them why am i so you know i 'm so timid you know i just i should have just went in there and just asked them you know sometimes i try to get the photo without having to ask you know because like you just you 're quick because it 's just about it 's just about the moment and you know that if you ask them you get into the post it becomes a whole different photograph and it 's not about the pose it 's really about them going about their own business and you 're trying to capture that moment you know really quickly this is what we asked you to like trying to demonstrate a little bit how what you need to do you know and help sometimes they might say no and that 's telling you i 'm just immediately when i when i when i approached her i just wanted to first i just wanted to relax and you know and to slow things down and you know calm down and just relax and just have an interesting conversation um i 'm not even trying to immediately take the photograph i just want to have a rapport get that report that 's really important you know sometimes the photograph could be could not come out the way you wish to come out but you would but the thing you remember is that report and then in that kind of the interaction that you both had and sometimes that 's that 's enough you know sometimes that 's the takeaway rather than the photograph you know um and sometimes that sometimes you get a good photograph but the report was really awkward and bad so when you look back at my photograph you go oh i know it 's a good photograph but that was that was the bad experience you know and and in some way that ruins it that ruins the photograph which every time you look at that photograph it reminds me of how awkward that situation was you don 't want to show that people that photograph it it 's still bad right and sometimes so sometimes when you get into a good conversation a good rapport that 's more important than that in the final photograph i feel um excuse me hey do you mind if i took a photo of you for a project that we 're doing uh okay yeah sure yeah all right cool um my name 's gary gary hello hello nice to meet you pat how 's your day today yeah good yeah i might get you to get a photo of you somewhere maybe i 'll move you around a little bit pat you want to take your sleep first let 's see how i see how you 're looking underneath this light and sure no you 're very comfortable pat how 's that chair okay i think i 've got it i think i got it all right it 's gonna get a wide shot of you so you 'll be in there and it 'll be like include the plants and the chairs and just the wide shot just to show get you to move the chair forward so you see how you 're folding your legs maybe put one leg on there and then cross your leg because do how sit how you 're sitting before but put one leg on there yeah and then just hit that 's that 's perfect yeah you 've got a really good posture pad you do and i like how you 're standing on that silver thing there funny when i look at photographs there 's always a particular part of the photograph that i 'm attracted like my eyes are just like that little bit that little thing on the corner i love that photograph and sometimes i fall in love with photographs just for their little little parts so me asking you to put your feet on that little silver bit is my way of going look at that little thing look at that little detail that i added in you know like i thought about it it 's not just got pat sit on the chair it 's like i actually thought about it 's not a coincidence that pat set that up or it could be a coincidence you know i 'll leave that up to whoever 's looking at the photograph yeah i might get a photo of you just just the way you are okay now a bit closer put the other feet down pad just put two faces on yeah yeah cool yeah nice yeah you want to stand up i might get a photo of you just like standing up somewhere if you can stand up on this sit on the first see if it holds you well maybe just stand on it move your head that way a little bit back yeah now great i 'll turn my little fill flash on and see if that does anything whoa okay one with one of the flashing one without the flash man you got huge hands compared to mine anyway i mean it 's all proportional let me okay it 's always about you and the environment you know and i was always about trying to fit you into the environment somehow um so i was trying to get you to relax i was trying what i want to do is i want to find something that you have on you that kind of speaks to the environment you know and i i was struggling for that i was like what is it is it we 're gonna take a shirt can i line it up with some kind of checkered thing on the wall there isn 't anything there you know um and the light 's not really helping me ideally i 'd have you know it 's coming straight down so it 's your eyes you know it 's giving you like a dark shadow on your finger your shin spring and snow technically it 's not lit well you know sounds like uh it 's not well kind of there 's not much i tried putting flash on or i can 't_''_673.76 you know there 's not much i can do about that i thought maybe i can get you to stand on the thing but maybe i don 't want to risk hurting you so we kind of compromise and stand there a second well i 'll find

    "text": "what 's in the mix recycling then empty all right so my name is gary tren um i guess i would describe myself as a visual artist working photography in the last couple of years i 'm doing a bit of painting as well and some video but predominantly i 've been working in photography in christmas of 1986 right this is crazy christmas is on 1986. i was really interested in graffiti i wasn 't doing graffiti but there was graffiti like the graffiti was a hot thing and there was these two graffiti books that i saw in the mix right one was spray can art that one was subway out you know and they were behind glass the glass casing at the mix you know and i really wanted them i really wanted those books so my for christmas of 86 asked my parents to buy me those books as a christmas gift you know and they did you know and i 've got them books i 've got these books with me here and so they did and that 's kind of set me on to to emulate um first kind of just doing graffiti in my notebooks you know but then thinking more about it and actually wanting to be the person photographing the graffiti i started like getting on trains and bringing my camera with me and like taking my camera everywhere and when i see a bit of graffiti i 'll like jump off the train i like trying to get a photo of that graffiti and jump back on the train and get going to where i needed to go you know so i spent a bit of time doing that when i was in high school just photographing the kind of local graffiti around sydney and it was it was because of these two books that kind of start me on that path of like wanting to pick up a camera but also looking at artwork too on the street i didn 't know what fine art was i had no idea i just thought i was graffiti you know after me was graffiti at that time you know and so it set me on that path of like wandering the was looking at foodie then eventually that led to other things you know that was like much more interesting than graffiti itself you know yeah so this is a camera that i used to photograph the graffiti in the 80s but then also when i started photographing skateboarding it was also the camera that i used to photograph the skateboarding so um i 've got some of my my kind of graffiti photos with me that i can show you i saw in this album there 's a lot more this is just one of many many albums this person is a coffee artist from new york he doesn 't know who i am but just because i have a camera like it 's my excuse to hang around and just document you know his work in progress yeah so just me like spending hours and my weekends and walking the street with that camera and just like documenting graffiti because someone has to do it right it might as well be me and also like how long would it be up before someone actually paints over it and gone don 't have my camera with me and the very next weekend or the next day i 'll come with my camera and i 'll like photograph that piece you know and then i 'll walk maybe for another hour around that area to see what else is on what else is around there you know it was just fun walking the street also it was meditative you know it was camera no one 's bothering you just walk the streets documenting the graffiti it 's kind of meditative and fun it was my way of getting into that kind of zone you know no at the time i wasn 't thinking about photography i was thinking about i just want to get a record of this graffiti i wasn 't thinking about hey i 'm going to be a photographer no it was it wasn 't that i was just like this is murray let me just photograph this graffiti you know so in that sense i wasn 't thinking about barriers into art or anything i was just like this is what i like this is just that just graffiti nothing nothing in our existed except graffiti graffiti was the art world so that was it that was the last thing i know a few years after starting you know doing that i met a guy called aaron brown when i was at university studying doing a bachelor of arts and he was a photographer he was a photographer i specialize in photographing skateboarding i grew up skateboarding i was a skateboarder you know i lived and breathed skateboarding up to that point you know so i met him and he was a skateboarder too but he also was a photographer photographing skateboarding and he did it for a lot of the local skateboarding magazines so we were at uni one day and he 'd brought it up and then he 'd show me some of his work that he 'd been doing for the magazine he we used to take photos using slide film so he showed me one of these slides you know and he gave me one and i remembered it was a bright sunny day i just put it up to my eye and see it it was so clear the colors the image was so crisp and so almost like more real life than real life you know and i was completely like got smacked about that and i said i said to myself i want to do that i want to learn how to do what he does you know and so from that point on i really started um yeah focusing on photography i eventually started following him around as he was photographing skateboarders and i got some of the skateboard magazines with me so this is the first time i ever got like my pictures one of the first time i ever got i got i got a proper spread in a magazine i wasn 't even an official photographer at this contest i just had a camera and a flash and i was like i 'm going to be 10 i 'd be long here and i 'm going to jump the barrier and i just started taking photos and no one was saying no you can 't do it because there wasn 't that many people there no you know no one had them there wasn 't that many people cameras you know so you can do it you can jump the barrier and just all of a sudden blend in into the other more official looking photographers and just take photos just snap away you know so i did i went to a lot of skateboarding competitions and that 's how i got all so close to action you know this is my peak of my skateboarding photography i got the cover shot yeah this is tony hawk at bondi beach doing him a twist you know there wasn 't anybody there that day skateboarding was dead in the mid 90s no one cared about skateboarding there wasn 't anybody around and there was only maybe maybe like half a dozen people there watching him skate you know this demo and i had i like i had my camera with me you know and i took a few photos and they felt great and send them into a magazine and and yeah i got i got the cover photograph and i got a couple other photographs in it looks like i was on the ramp with him but i 'm actually not on the ramp where this ramp was situated at bondi beach it had a big half pipe at bona beach there was actually a a um a parking lot that was leveled with the the ramp you know it was on the same kind of height as the deck of the ramp so i was on that kind of way you parked the cars and and looking directly um sort of at the height of the ramp so i just stood on that platform and with my zoom lens and zoomed into it and got the photo it wasn 't just one shot you know i took a whole bunch of shots and some some of the photos i took like he didn 't land that his boards just flipped everywhere you know he 's like his face wasn 't showing and i was you know so it took about half a role to actually get it for him to sort of build into the trick you know for him to like okay confident enough me to like okay now i 'm ready now i know what to look for now i know how how high he 's gonna go you know and i 'm ready for it because i 've made all those mistakes beforehand you know i was only maybe doing photo photography for maybe three years when i got that cover you know so i was very still very new to it you know also the amateur it was incredible i thought i 'd i thought i can do this all the time only time i 've ever been on cover or anything yeah so after spending a couple of years hanging out with aaron you know hanging out with skateboarders and taking a whole bunch of skateboarding photography i eventually enrolled into a photography or a visual communications degree at the university of western sydney and i eventually was formally taught how to take photographs you know and so by doing that course um and still doing a lot of skateboarding photography at the same time um it kind of open up my eyes to other other types of vlogs you kind of graffiti which involved spending lot of time on the street then having an interest in skateboarding which again involved a lot of times being on the street it was natural for me to spend a lot of time on the street with my camera you know so being on the street with my camera a lot i kind of just fell into kind of photographing candid street photography so just carrying a small camera like this and just walking the street and just capturing those really special candid moments so i 've spent maybe the last 10 years doing that candid street photography in the library is what i was trying to do in the library so instead of being out in the street we 're in the library and the challenges for me to photograph the way i photograph on the street but in the library setting so just walking on around the library exploring different parts of the library seeing what kind of catches my eye and what i can photograph the interest my interest in photography and my challenge that took that i given myself everyday setting you know not setting anything up you know trying to find a uniqueness in that draw that out you know with my camera photograph that capture it it 's really i mean photography about for me it wasn 't really about the equipment so much it 's really about just what you see you know showing people sharing with people what you see you know it 's a great medium to share your ideas with i mean there 's so many ways of getting into photography i think one way to start is to find a passion that you have already for something else right and look at how photography is done in that kind of field and enter photography for that way you _"

    "text": "[Music] my name is luke close i 'm a gettable artist from the northern rivers new south wales lismore is where i 'm living i 'm living on widgetable country my latest exhibition it 's called perspective is happening at the mali from the 22nd of october through to the 29th of november it 's called perspective because of the way i look at things and i also see myself in a corridor of life where nine or eight corridors are backed up to each other so my perspective may be different to somebody else 's and it 's the way i look at things and it 's through a cultural identity it 's through a song lie and it 's through a connection with my country and that i 'm actually sharing and bringing and giving other people a glimpse of so you 're getting a portal into my dream it 's a life force it 's a source and it comes from one end of the universe and it channels through me and it is coming out through the artwork that is presented here what i 'd like they 're a unique important person on this planet and you 're on the spirit mother who is here to look after and protect you and guide you and you have a role too and that is to look after yourself look after the people around you and acknowledge the plant animal and the fabric of this land as something that nourishes you not you take from it not you steal from it not you destroy but you look after that 's what i 'd like people to take away from this exhibition [Music] so um my name is kyra cumsing i 'm a malara bungalong and mirakudi deway i 'm from northern new south wales and also conclary queensland i 'm also an artist and a curator at umali aboriginal artists cooperative i got into the arts um by i was living up on country and i 've come back to sydney and i needed to work so i ended up coming here and being a gallery hand at burmali and then after that i 've continued to practice my um artist practice and also as a curator so for me as a curator and in the performing arts as well as contemporary arts i guess i 've always been driven by my connection to country and that is what i 've always maintained as growing up i was lucky enough to be able to go in and out of the arts started out as a dancer then i went into journalism media and then after that i 've ended up in as a curator now so and also doing a bit of art when i can but curating at the moment 's taking most of my time however i do love to do art when i get the chance and it keeps me connected to who i am so this year alone i 've managed to do curate four exhibitions oh actually it 's three exhibitions um and i mentored a first-timer artist to um um teach her the ropes around curating and some of the um different sorts of things that we have to do as a curator i 'm also an installer as well so it 's it 's quite different because i 'm also putting show and the ones that i have done this year which i 'm probably most proud of was my suicide awareness exhibition called invincible um it hasn 't been easy during covert but i feel that we needed to do those exhibitions um even if it 's hard-hitting it was um intended to make you think about some of the issues that are going on in our communities firsthand and getting those mothers in was important to put on this show as well as our own artist i guess it 's important to support your aboriginal organizations so people such as like the organization i work for boomer aboriginal artists cooperative we have opened that door for really the community to be able to break into the contemporary art space especially in sydney we represent new south wales aboriginal artists and volunteering as well that gets you help also upskilling yourself and learning the trades and the tricks of the industry has helped me and also having a good support base around you and making sure that you 're safe within yourself [Music] my name is haley pigrum and i 'm from southwest sydney my people are originally from that area from the hawkesbury parramatta river area i originally got into visual arts when i was about 25 years old i didn 't do any visual arts in high school because i thought that you had to have like a natural talent for it and i just didn 't study it at all and i studied all the sciences because i was a bit of a brainy nerd and then when i was about 25 years old i left everything that i had been doing because i wasn 't doing very well mentally and i started doing a program run by mission australia called creative youth initiatives and i remember walking in and i said i really like art but i 'm not any good at it and they were like oh that 's okay and i picked up a paintbrush for the first time and i had a lot of fun and it turned out i was pretty good at it because it kind of has nothing to do with natural talent it has to do with if you and if you keep trying and that was 10 years ago this year and i kind of haven 't left visual arts since then which was really weird because all my life before then i had done all sciency stuff so it was a very big surprise to everyone in my life that i would just start doing art stuff and be very successful at it and have a lot of fun i thought art could be the career for me because the first time i did any kind of art i thought to myself this is the first time i 've ever done something in my entire life where i 'm happy and content and i don 't want to do anything else i 'm not rushing to finish it so i can go home and do something else i 'm not thinking about the tv show or the video game i want to play at the end of the day i 'm not thinking about the music i want to listen to i 'm not thinking about the friend i want to be talking to i 'm just meditation or something and then when i finished the program that i was doing they actually had a really big exhibition and you hung all your art on the walls in the gallery at the local tafe and people could buy your work and some people bought some of my work and they weren 't my family or my friends or anyone that i knew and i was incredibly shocked that people would pay actual money for something that i made and so i was like so i can do something that i don 't hate and people will pay the money for it now i didn 't think i would get rich and to be fair i haven 't_''_556.959 um and i still have to work other jobs and then in the creative field but i get to do something i really love and makes me feel really connected to my culture and my ancestors and my family and i 've never been able to find anything else that makes me feel that way _"

to be glam because i got to admit i don 't really know that many footy fans not in my close circles like a few of my family members yeah what about you just growing up with it you know three elder brothers who all played i get the high like what what does sports mean to you oh god um that 's a good question james because i think that we 've got more in common like than we give it credit for there 's things that we do with our family with our people with our community you know and maybe that 's what sports about as well it 's just about being with your people bringing everybody together yeah what are they both really about sporting heroes and the like i guess yeah much like you know our elders for the lgbtqi community and paying homage to legacies 's about respect isn 't it it 's about respect i love how what you were saying about how you know mardi gras is a time where we where we remember our queer elders who paved the way for us yeah like the more we talk about it the more i realized like it 's isn 't the same thing but you know this is to be we 'll learn all this today we 'll see we 'll find out [Music] never had much coordination myself didn 't pick up anything from from your family either from the boys well you know having three older brothers couldn 't play it not even wasn 't even enticed to play that 's their thing well it 's a bit like you know us i guess to a degree where you know they 've got their colors and all that sort of stuff as far as having the rainbow pride flag representation you 've even got like the whole performative element of it in you know the stadium and cheering for people and yeah it 's not the same as the margaret buddy lives that bought the bands and the cheerleaders cheerleaders [Music] it 's wonderful that could be us today well we 've got the pumpkin [Music] [Music] a little bit of footy action oh yes yeah i 'm actually really uncle um do you know how to do you know how to kick a ball around i can kick a ball oh yes i 've never done it before that little guy at once or twice okay all right well you 'll be the teacher today all right i 'll try not to i 'll try not to slip on my uh slip on my slip well i 'll i 'll go i won 't go too hard okay all right yeah take it easy on me gentle as a possible kick thank you i appreciate that and thank god the soft balls anyway [Music] finally we 've made it so how did you come to be a storm stand my whole family goes for parramatta and i was just one of those sort of contrarian kind of kids and i went to the magpies and then um i just i a like i 'm a member of a club a thousand kilometers away i think just through um my own kind of salesmanship i 've got my my wife and my son involved they they they love coming to their games and like he 's just sunburied and falls off the storm too go into a match yeah how is it for you leading up to go into your match like starting from home i i think we when we played uh it was a 2009 grand final we played parramatta catching the train as soon as the doors opened i had a whole platform of parapan just building me it was pretty it was it was it was a good night it was fun you know and then i walked down under and i 'm coming up this lift all these people are hanging there and viewing me i was the only one to me but set the tone it 's been interesting as we 've come to visit this stadium we 've seen a few parallels between like our experiences with culture and what brings people together and family you know it 's a different type of event but it 's similar in a kind of way but like mardi gras for us is almost like going to a big game you have all that lead up to it the prep the prepping for it the hype with the yeah you know and just how hard one it 's been over the years to actually get to this stage but it 's really like it 's beautiful thinking about how different people get together and how you 've got this one common goal that you 're all going to celebrate i just want to really take it in and enjoy it because i know these these periods of success aren 't going to last forever with your team you know you 're obviously going to go through troughs as well so i just really focus this year especially i 'm just just having fun with my son being able to make them just really making those great memories with your family too right [Music] you 've been you are a football player you are a fan and also do you think it is that that gets people so invested in their team it 's a part of your life part of the australian culture and i grew up in the country and was exposed to rugby league from about the age of four you know my dad was a footballer his dad was a footballer um so i suppose it was my bloodline so you know hopefully one day play the game and i think it 's in your blood i think you really get a thrill out of seeing people going out there and doing their best in the field and it 's a sport at the highest level you know they fit men they train hard so say i was looking for a team because i don 't really have a team like i 've i 've been to a nails game i would i 'd cheer for the eels because you know i 've got an artist studio here in parramatta okay how do you find the team that 's right for you and why do you choose a team to be anything like as the field have people influenced by what happens what players do on the field as well in a big way makes it makes a difference what 's one essential thing that we 're going to need as um as team supporters the jews show the colors that 's it see the players wearing their own little seal that 's what they want to have that 's what the players wear is what the fan wants to wear it 's the colors also are there any that you recognize i 'm i 'm familiar with the rabbitohs there oh yeah well we might have a bit of a look around yourself thank you so much um it was really great chatting with you too thank you how 's your balls going oh hey all right here we go let 's see how nova goes ah she 's a natural oh i dropped me what 'd you find what a day um this fabulous costume oh i love her beautiful colors lovely what stood out for me today was meeting chris and how he 'd mentioned so what sort of made him grandfather being you know fans as well of the sport but also bringing in his son you know i thought that was pretty kind of special yeah i really love that it 's it 's something obviously that 's shared shared of generations shared within community and it 's like a shared passion it was lovely do we want to try this on all i 'd love to i can 't wait to see hey look in that green and round babe for you [Music] [Music] so [Music] just dance [Music] i 'm trying to explain you _"

    "text": "[Music] do my name is jocelyn and i work at the parramatta heritage visitor information centre i 'm here today to tell you about a great parramatta architect who worked in this district from the 1840s onwards his name is james hewson james hewson was born into a family of builders in 1800 in scotland young james was apprenticed to his father as a builder not an architect he learned to build in all building forms from timber brick and stone the thorough scottish education system ensured that james also learnt plastering bookkeeping and glazing times were tough in scotland in the 1820s and hewson went to london town where he quickly rose from a builder to a quantity surveyor in 1832 james hewson sailed into sydney town with no job no income and no contacts he had his education his wits and his work experience remembering prestigious london judge stevenson commissioned hugheson to build a front veranda on his darlinghurst mansion orwell many people saw and admired this front veranda perhaps because of this veranda john verge in 1835 commissioned james hugheson to be his master or construction builder parramatta colonial royalty hannah ball and anna mcarthur hugheson 's training and skills meant that he could interpret verge 's plans without supervision was able to hire tradesmen and labourers source building supplies and even balance the books hugheson 's high standard of workmanship combined with his honesty resulted in him being recognised as a master builder all in the one project vineyard it was also at vineyard that hewson met his wife anne a scottish maid working for the macarthurs they came to live in parramatta with hugheson purchasing an old house and a timber yard an astute move for a young builder it was on this site that he built the family home kia ora they had a long and happy marriage raised 12 children and volunteered at their local church san andreas presbyterian church james 's meteoric rise was set to continue here in parramatta parramatta 's first parliamentarian george oaks commissioned james in 1841 to design his new home perth house here in george street this was james 's first commission as an architect and he 'd finally gained recognition as a professional man here in design a front veranda verandas originated in india and quickly spread throughout the british colonies including here in parramatta a veranda is a structure that stops the hot sun from heating up buildings it 's also an economic means of expanding living areas for growing families here at perth house the veranda columns are made from timber set in stone hobs the stone hobs were a clever idea to stop termites from eating up into the timber columns james went on to design and build wave a tree in new zealand street for himself he later gave wave a tree to his daughter anne as a wedding present this reflected the wealth the family had now accumulated whilst in parramatta meanwhile james had entered into a partnership with local master stone mason nathaniel payton the pair went on over the next 25 years to build many of parramatta 's beautiful private and public buildings early in their partnership they decided to build not just one major public building but two parramatta courthouse that once stood in church street and where we are now parramatta jail colonial architect mortimer lewis commissioned and police lockup parramatta jail was based on british reform ideas with blocks radiating out from a central observation tower and enclosed by a massive perimeter wall what a gamble how were they going to find enough tradesmen laborers and building supplies surely this pair were heading for bankruptcy the fact that both jobs were completed on time and within budget proved everybody wrong person was next called upon to design churches the first being all saints anglican here in north parramatta built in a gothic design and completed in 1847. the cumberland times proudly commented that this would be both a pretty and elegant structure and the architect is our townsman mr james hussein this commission was closely followed by saint john 's anglican cathedral in parramatta son johns had been in a state of disrepair for years and houston had been commissioned to build a norman style chancel and nave he had to match up these new buildings with existing twin towers this was a difficult job for any architect the fact that these structures are still standing today speaks volumes of husson 's talents as parramatta grew he was elected to parramatta 's first district council in 1844 to tremendous applaud the parramatta chronicle went on to say that james a man of property possessed every moral and intellectual qualification necessary for office he was then elected to treasurer of parramatta hospital in 1848 this showed that the people of parramatta had a lot of faith in james 's ability to handle public money honestly the most important committee position for james personally was that of a water commissioner the family had lost a child to disease from polluted water james fought for the people of parramatta to have a permanent and clean water supply which resulted in the building of hunts creek dam or lake parramatta james continued to design and build beautiful homes in parramatta including morton house and indram and some humbler structures such as the shelter sheds at the parramatta lunatic asylum upon retirement he handed his business interests over to his children and quietly gave up his treasured committee positions he planted an orchard drank tea with anne and visited his many friends and grandchildren throughout the district james was known as of 75 years and is buried up at maize hill cemetery overlooking his beloved parramatta [Music] you _"

brought the fabrics i designing the puzzagi i wash out an ironing and cut it out [Music] i make 75 centimeters by 70 by 5 centimeters now i 'm designing puzzle like this looks seven pieces firstly we decided to order in this water again firstly this piece and this piece connect together first and then pinch stitching next i 'll do pinch stitching this part and this part then we 're connecting nine pieces firstly i 'm attaching one two three like this to make a block and one two three block again one two three and and then i 'm attaching three pieces [Music] sewing together here and sewing together with some salt here and then finishing all four sides [Music] [Music] firstly i 'll do this pinchy stitchy now let 's make a note first like this and then two times all three times but this thread is d so two times is okay thanks firstly in puja needle crease is easier to fold [Music] make a crease using this tool of hera is okay if you don 't have a marker you can use the same level [Music] using simple make a crease [Music] very easy to fold straightly then sewing normally pinch stitching the double length is good this much start with we don 't need hiding the knots because the pinch is stitching after pinching the chain we cover the sort don 't need the hiding the notes to pinch stitching priority thing is the as far as good to sewing clothes is good i using thick thread and needle because you could see easily [Music] as close as good [Music] i already sewn diagonally and straightway already now i draw the leaves this is used plastic i draw the semi oval shape half of oval shape making the template i i think this size i make half of [Music] leaves here i draw the [Music] half of oval shape and draw the line with pens using chalk pencil draw the half of leaves and do [Music] other side sleeves again look fold make a crease [Music] and marking the crease this side then we pinch stitching through the this line through the pinches stitching [Music] pinches then slightly pour out the mozzarella [Music] foreign same as a straight line [Music] already increased crease this lip shape so easy to fold do running stitching [Music] you can use the template one leaves one knife and second and third and fourth one template using all your water the pinch stitching is tight deep and closer screw closer from the edge screw because after pinch stitching the fabric size is smaller than original size [Music] from the edges under one millimeters and the stitches one millimeter stitch between the stitches one millimeters it 's a little good finish the leaf we have to hide the [Music] mod again okay this is back side [Music] to make smooth cut line and make a note i show you [Music] two times or three times [Music] and we have to hide it the tail [Music] come through the [Music] pinchy stitchy [Music] inside the pinch stitch turner here come out then [Music] cutting the red [Music] [Music] amazing sim method samsung is only korean have a samsung metal i samsung is the best way to one a yakuzaki i 'll show you firstly two pieces of fabrics [Music] i draw the line one centimeters and using marker [Music] just crease some people 's using short pencil first and then crease again you can choose anyways a good one centimeters then through the line first two [Music] fold the line for little one centimeter from the edges pieces face to [Music] seam together [Music] then pin it together using pin in this way [Music] not parallel with the etsy because [Music] if you have a slippery berries pin it here sometimes slippery like this so we put pin in 1990 degrees on the edge [Music] then whip stitching together i 'll show you rip stitching i choose a bit better because you can see easily and normally [Music] in korean older times korean chosen the red color or yellow color because they like the red color the red color is the prevent the protect the better things so they like red color all right this way it 's like this [Music] very close [Music] one millimeters [Music] [Music] this is the exercising piece [Music] don 't worry about this thickness you could choose the thin one not too thin because in bulgaria the thread is very [Music] easy to see [Music] you could choose again normally it is a whip stitching [Music] the length is the 1.2 five [Music] times [Music] [Music] this is the rib stitching then make an ozone like this two times [Music] the face side here excited here not to open the seam like this we cover the right cup every two probably [Music] so we will cut the purple fabric smaller than 5mm and over the upper seams with right cloth and [Music] we increase [Music] the seven millimeters but up to you crease the line this one and you can see the lining here fold to of course [Music] formed two same way [Music] with two fabrics [Music] pining [Music] like this and this side [Music] in sun 's room don 't need hiding the notes [Music] this interval is not important the fine is good [Music] all attached to your berries edgy i 'm using the hg with running stitching 0.5 centimeters from the edge and one centimeters again i 'll show you easy to [Music] it is 2.25 centimeters and one centimeters again two lines [Music] and this side is back side beside the front side quickening [Music] fold and fold again [Music] then just open it [Music] we 'll do all around the edge like this if you have a corner if you do corner same way 0.5 and then 0.5 [Music] i 'll do this finish this line and learning sketchy hiding the notes inside of the [Music] seam [Music] approximately 2.2 mil 2 centimeters and then one is the two running speeches [Music] [Music] [Music] so i remained the gap here because i explained for the corner it 's the same centimeters with this line 0.5 and one centimeters again i 'll do [Music] a chalk 2.5 centimeter and one centimeter you can see the lines fold inward [Music] again [Music] [Music] and pin it here we 'll keep going to the edge straight line keep going to the end [Music] hmm and hiding the thread between the nozzle hiding and then start again with this side this between the cloth [Music] [Music] and if you finish it here and make a knot here [Music] this is the final works recycling puzzagi ma i um i designing this usagi freely you can do any any composition is okay look at this i put samsung in and here look at this samsung is the best way to one layer muzaki back side is the same as frontside whip stitching and lip stitching again and i did pinch stitching here and here you can pattern in and pinch stitch and lastly i do running stitching all over

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone i 'm rachel and i 'm kaisha and we are from wentworth point community centre and library this week we 're celebrating children 's book week this is a really special week in libraries because it celebrates early literacy and learning for children so the theme for this year is curious creatures and wild minds so i bet you guys are all wondering what we 're going to be getting up to today today we 're going to be showing you how to make your own stop-motion video with a curious creature of your own creation [Music] so what is stop motion well stop motion is a form of filmmaking where they take photos of an object or a character and then they move them slightly between each photo so that when the photos are played together it looks like the object or character is moving by themselves so some examples of movies that you might know that do this are children the sheep coraline the nightmare before christmas and many more so it 's almost like a flip book but a video yeah that 's basically materials you will need [Music] paper [Music] scissors stop motion coloring pencils or textures [Music] phone or tablet so the app that we 're going to be using is called stop motion studio this is a free app to download however it does have some in-app purchases we won 't be using those though just remember that you do need to ask your parents permission before you download anything [Music] do [Music] so when you first open the app you 'll be able to see all of your past projects you can then go into them you can look at them watch your completed ones but today we 're going to start a brand new project so we need you to select the new movie plus sign yeah when you go into the plus sign it opens up your camera and you might see some things along the side so starting from the left top we 're going to see a back arrow so when you click on that one it 's going to take you backwards to back where all the projects went and then we 'll just go to leave the app just yet underneath the backwards arrow we have a microphone symbol so we can 't use that one just yet because we haven 't actually started to record our stop motion but we 'll show you a clip of us [Applause] three weeks later alrighty rachel are you ready to start voiceovering yeah this will be clap yep so with our voiceovering all we 've got to do is press the mic button that we talked about a bit earlier we want to allow the stop motion studio to record audio and then we 're gonna start so ready to record we 're going to record so what we want to do is we want to make some funny noises so our video has our little hole punch i think when he walks in maybe we should have it yeah yeah stomping noises and then we 've got some paper that slides in so i might have my hand right across the table make a noise and then i want the hole punch to make a funny noise when it cleans the paper okay you 're a clip of us using it so that you can see what it 's like you can use this part to add a voiceover so you can give your character voices you can make little bang noises if someone gets hit yep and so that 's what that one does so next we have the plus symbol now we 're not actually going to use this one today because unfortunately everything in the app is not free and this is one of those things that isn 't free so unless you ask your parents for permission to buy in app purchase we 're not going to use it make sure you ask your page permission if you want to use this feature but we 're going we 're not going to so let 's just forget about it yep so we don 't need that one today next up we 've got a little setting symbol right below the plus sign so if you click into that one it comes up with so many options so you might want to sit tight this is a long explanation so first off kind of looks like something from your mum or dad 's car so you can choose how many pictures flip through the screen in a second so you can choose if your video is going to go really really fast it 's going to go a bit slower so it depends how you think you want your video to go the next symbol kind of looks like a little triangle so this one is used for effects you can choose if you want your film to fade in from black or if you want your food filled to fade out to black or if you 're feeling really daring you can choose to do both of course you can also choose to have none at all if you don 't really feel feel like you 're one of those fading and fading out people already the next to that we have a sort of square with some triangles in the corner so this is how you 're going to frame your video so you know how some movies have a really wide screen well you can choose to do that really white sport you want something really close together maybe your video needs something close together you can choose that and there 's a lot of options to pick through so you can go ahead and take your pick next to that one we have two squares on top of each other and this one is our foreground and our background so you can choose if you want to be on the moon if you want to be in a sunny field you can take a look through all of these and see if any of them are something you want to add to your movie but we 're not going to use any of those today next up we have some filters so if you use facebook or snapchat or anything like that you might have seen some filters before so here you can choose to make your film a black and white film or you can give it a sepia tone so you can take a look through those have a play around and then maybe you can make yourself a bit more interesting like that then we tell you what kind of quality your video is going to be so we don 't really think we need to change any of that because it 's a stop-motion video yeah we don 't need it to be in 4k_._498.4 but we can 't have it hd which is good enough for us and then last up we have a button that kind of looks like the youtube button so this is where you can use your editing skills a bit so you can choose to have the first symbol which is a arrow going this way with a line next to it and that one is you want it to only play from where you 're up to in filming your show next where you have a cycling arrows and that is if you want your video to automatically replay and then last up we have the include live playback now we don 't want to worry about that one so we can ignore it we 're gonna use it and then last up we have a number that says three seconds and that is a countdown to like we 've went through all of our settings thanks for sitting through the long spiel lots of settings so what should we talk about next so for the next part of this video we 're going to move around a bit so you might see us change the scene a bit ready on the count of three we 're going to click and our scenery will change one two three wow cool so since we are going to be creating our creature over and over again we should really make it simple um so starting off we might draw a really simple shape so what do you feel like really i think i think i might draw a rectangle yeah that 's really simple really simple sort of interesting i might go for a super super simple circle then we need to think about a face so the face doesn 't have to be like yours and mine because remember we 're making curious creatures so it can have maybe just one eye and maybe it doesn 't even have a mouse i like your idea of one eye make mine just a little bitty dot okay so we also need to think about some features of our creatures so i think mine 's gonna be a cactus so if mine 's gonna be cactus i need to put some spikes on it but i also need to remember to keep it simple so i won 't do too many i 'll just do like that and i think i might give mine a beak because i 've decided it 's gonna be a chicken some other features you might give it are because it 's a chicken i might give him and two little legs but he 's only got two toes that 's okay and maybe i 'll give him a frill i think the frill makes it really cold this feels so you don 't have to have regular fake either maybe maybe you want them to be spring a spring yeah that would be a really curious creature so maybe they jump they can use the springs to jump instead of flying and then we also have to think about expressions so maybe in some my chicken 's eye will instead of being a circle turn into a half angry eye oh that 's a good idea that 's really simple too so that 's all you have to do to change it so your chicken becomes more android or maybe he 's very embarrassed so we 'll give him a little washi or maybe if he 's sad you can put a little tea there do you have a blue texture i don 't blue texture with next we need to think about how we 're going to write our story alrighty since we 're going to be writing our story maybe we 'll move it up a bit and we 'll tip the table we 'll tip the [Music] table [Music] that was a bit too fast for me i don 't think my heart can handle it [Music] so what do we know about writing a story well we know that we need to have a start an action and a conclusion so what might be the start of our story well maybe we can start off with a seed on a comes to life yeah because we don 't want a boring old seat on the page he comes to life and maybe he doesn 't want to be on the page anymore he feels stuck so he better pull himself up so this sounds like we 're getting into our action so action would be that he 's pulled himself away from the page falls down and maybe because he 's a seed he should be in the forest yeah okay and then our conclusion how we gonna end the story well i don 't want him to just be a seed because he 's easy on the forest it can 't go anywhere maybe it rains and he becomes a flower so now that we have our story let 's break it down a bit so let 's decide on what our what our when our where and our how so what is our what culture and what is a our what is a seed named curtis who wants to escape his page and he might become what [Applause] very good so what is our when where this is 've got a nice bright sun out but then maybe some nasty storm clouds come in and cover this up but maybe it should end on a nice sunny day again what about our where where is this going to happen well first it 's going to be on a blank page with our seed but maybe since he wants to be free he 'll go into the forest so we 'll have to have some nice big trees and maybe it 's at the bottom of the mountains where you get stuck so you can see some trees as well pretty good it 's coming together yeah so lastly we need to think about the how how is this all gonna come about well when he peels off the page and rolls through the forest and gets stuck at the bottom of the mountain it 's going to rain with our storm clouds and then our lovely curse is going to become a flower that grows from the ground and he 's gonna come from inside the flower he 's going to pop out on the ground we will curtis the cactus sounds like we have our story and we 're ready to make our stop-motion video [Music] so now we 're going to show you how we made a movie let 's get to it [Music] oh [Music] oh well that was a lot of work rachel was it definitely but let 's take a look and see how it turned out let 's have a look at curtis the cactus origin story [Music] well thank you for joining us today we hope you enjoyed our movie curtis the cactus origin story we are very interested in what you guys can come up with yep so be sure to send in all of your entries to the email address below and we 're so happy you could join us for this event be sure to keep a lookout on our facebook page for any other that you might be interested in joining and we look forward to seeing you at wentworth point community center and [Music] library

pray all of this in the name of the prince of peace himself the lord jesus christ oh man oh man well friends it is time for our commemoration address and this year i have the honor of welcoming captain ross mountier of parramatta 's own first 15th royal new south wales lancers captain mountain the president parameter rsl sub branch mr ron grace city of paramount lord mayor mr bob dwyer distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen today 102 years ago at 11 o war one the world had never seen a war of such destruction and loss and its effects are still felt today each year since all the countries involved in that war stopped to reflect on the steep price they paid for victory world war one was a defining moment in our history on the shores of gallipoli our anzac legend was forged where australia lost 8 000 killed following gallipoli the trench war and air campaigns of the western front the mounted campaigns in the middle east and our naval operations on the high seas added tens of thousands to the toll that war remains the most costly in our history from a population of near five million three hundred thousand volunteered and one in five of those were killed in total 62 000 made the ultimate sacrifice at the time our forebears hoped that this was the war to end all wars but that was not to be and thus remembrance day has evolved so that we now commemorate all of australia 's 102 000 men and women who have lost their lives across all our wars our honor continent on earth together they represent an ocean of sadness and sacrifice why do they do it why do they risk and lose so much can anything positive be gained through such pain suffering and undying grief the answer is yes each struggle each tragic death was a step taken to create and maintain a better and freer world we enjoy that better world which they paid for we are indebted to them they whisper to us through the mists of time and they ask only two things firstly that we never forget them and secondly that we do not despoil that which they cherished so much thank you captain mountier friends we 've come to uh that moment where we will um in order to do just what we 've been asked not to do in order not to forget uh we will lay a number of commemorative wreaths uh there are a number of our designated wreath layers representing of course various local organizations i will call their name in due course in a moment it may be that you have brought your own private tribute today as 're going to ask that you would wait until the end of our ceremony right at the end until you come and bring your tribute and i will let you know clearly when the moment for that is as well thank you again for your patience uh and and grace uh in in doing that for us so now i 'd like to welcome uh invite one by one our replayers mr ron grace president of the city of parramatta sub-branch of the rsl our guest of honor captain ross mancier from the first 15th royal new south wales lancer regiment city of parramatta lord mayor councillor bob dwyer deputy lord mayor of parramatta councillor michelle gerard representing the federal member for parramatta julie owens mp is councillor samia panty i 've been asked to convey to you the sincere apologies of jeff lee a local member for parramatta who unfortunately has a conflicting appointment this morning on behalf of the new south wales police force the parramatta local area commander superintendent julie boone representing legacy is mr guy cooper mary bell secretary of the federation of navy ship associations caledonian pipe band [Music] so and on behalf of the first parramatta scout group mrs annette douglas thank you all friends to uh leaders in singing the national anthem uh would you please welcome mr ricky nifo [Music] how beauty rich and red [Music] joyful streams [Music] [Music] to share with [Music] let us [Music] [Laughter] [Music] thank you ricky friends please do take a seat as we draw uh the formal part of this ceremony to a close i wonder if you 'll allow me just a few more moments to reflect uh upon what we 're doing here uh and what uh padres are all over the world uh will be reflecting on uh with those in their care perhaps you knew i 'm sure many of you did today is the 100th year anniversary of the internment of the remains of the unknown soldier at westminster abbey faith and war were always strange fellows in the great war faith of course uh was lived out in the padres as they lived and encouraged the troops uh they were they were with the idea of that tomb of reverend david railton he was an army chaplain on the western front he 'd seen a grave marked by a rough cross and it bore the pencil-written legend an unknown british soldier so he wrote to the dean of westminster herbert ryle in 1920 proposing that an unidentified british soldier from the battlefields in france be buried with jews ceremony in westminster abbey quote amongst the kings to represent the many hundreds of thousands of empire as it was at the time dead the idea was strongly supported by the dean and the prime minister david lloyd george the inscription on the tome reads on the tomb reads beneath this stone rests the body of a british warrior unknown by name or rank brought from france to lie among the most illustrious of the land buried here on armistice day 11th of november 1920 in the presence of his majesty king george v is ministers of state the chiefs of his forces and a vast concourse of the nation thus our commemorated the many multitudes who during the great war gave that most that man can give life itself for for the sacred cause of justice and the freedom of the world they buried him among the kings because he had done good towards god and towards his house it occurs to me reflecting on this yesterday as as i was reading through it that the tomb of the unknown soldier is a visually symbolic reversal of the experience of many who lost their comrades and families he was unknown but his tomb is now famous but he represents those who were actually known to their loved ones whereas their tomb was unknown his unknownness is actually representative of those who are known intimately and he stands there therefore as a representation of what the captain rightly earlier calls that ocean of sadness and sacrifice but of course my preacher 's eye was also turned to the inscriptions that lie upon that too and two i want to draw to a close by pointing out to you on top of the tomb is written this 2 timothy chapter 2 verse 19 the lord knows those that are his and at the base is written first corinthians 15 22 in christ these thoughts uh perhaps a great pull together from those great truths inscribed upon that tone uh they flow of course from the even greater news of the lord jesus christ and what he has done for us the lord knows those that are his well the lord jesus christ uh that great king amongst the kings and yet also unknown to so many made himself known and chose to die so that there might not be a single one of us that would not be known by god the father who sent him and of course that same one rose again on the third day his tomb is now unknown and actually unnecessary why so that all those that are in him should be made alive so that as uh the apostle paul elsewhere puts we may grieve yet we do not grieve like those who have no hope christ 's death and resurrection of course speak of the great power of forgiveness and then of new life things for us to hold on to uh this day even over a century gone from the very first day that us don 't they these truths that in christ death and resurrection none of us need to be unknown before violence not least our dearly departed and none of us need to look at the future without hope i wonder if you will join with me in the final prayer oh god our ruler and guide in whose hands are the destinies of this and every nation who sent the lord jesus christ who came willingly that we may all be known by you and we may all know what it means to be made alive even though we may die we give you thanks for the freedoms we enjoy in this land and today especially for those who lay down their lives to defend them we pray that we and all the people of australia gratefully remembering their courage and their sacrifice encouraged by the forgiveness and hope that the death and resurrection of jesus brings we pray that we may have the grace to live in that spirit of justice generosity forgiveness and peace through jesus christ our lord who even now lives and reigns with you and and the blessing of god father son holy spirit be amongst you and those that you love this day and forever oh man friends thank you so much for joining us here together uh this morning uh do please on your way out thank those in particular who 've worked so hard to make this happen who were here long before we arrived and who will be here long after uh we leave now of course if you have brought your own personal tributes now it is also an appropriate time to bring them and lay them down thank you very much for being here this morning oh ladies and gentlemen uh mr and grace is quite rightly drawn to my attention that i have missed him out at the end of our ceremony today i 'd ask you just to take your seats and welcome him one more time i will appeal to him for the spirit of grace and forgiveness i

    "text": "welcome to floral expressions my name is charles lukassick and together with my wife joy we run this beautiful flower shop at north beach shopping village hello my name is anjali venter and today i 'm going to make a whimsical bouquet it 's great for weddings and it 's really good for birthdays as well lots of special occasions so i 'm using spider orchids as well as we 've got some lizzies here roses which i 'll be reflexing and also the cymbidium orchids so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to start with building my base how i want my flowers the bouquet to kind of go using gum and magnolia [Music] i 'm using some willow stick here in the back to give a bit more uh interest in the design now mother chrysanthemums are really popular they 're these big ball looking ones people really love them i 'm just going to add some copper glow as well so lizzie 's look really um these ones they look really very fragile but they last quite a long time compared to a 'm just starting to build it up kind of using the focal flowers here and these um lime flowers and i 'm using groupings which looks quite nice when you have a lot of the same flower in the bouquet grouped together okay these are called stock they smell really a lot very fragrant so we 've got some beronia which we will shall add probably here in the front so i 'm just going to tie this off sometimes it gets a bit too big to hold in your hand and you need to tie it off so you can add more flowers i 'm going to reflex these roses so often the growers will leave the growing petals on the outside which just protects the rose so you just take off the ones that are the growing petals and then what you do with these is you just kind of bend them backwards carefully and it kind of gives you that garden rose look that 's so popular try not to put them all at the same height because it looks not as interesting you can tie it nice whimsical bouquet got there it 's quite large and oh inspiring i hope they 're really great so come and visit joy and i at floral expressions at north mead shopping village we 'd love to see you soon you _"

new challenge throw it up in here cut and catch okay are you ready okay let 's add more claps the trick with this one is to always follow the ball with your eyes and nose [Applause] so follow the ball up with your arguments and down into your hands that 's it so when we 're catching the ball down there we want to put our fingers together that one 's for a cricket ball a netball any kind of on our fingers together when we 're passing and catching we want to make a w magic hand can you make a magic w butterfly [Music] so that 's our catching okay so we 'll keep doing a couple more things and we

a wall okay but just as i 've got magic mirror here with me we 're gonna do it together all right okay got my butterfly butterfly i 've got my butterfly i 'm gonna go push a butterfly follow it and you wanna push and point to where you 're passing that 's it awesome okay 10 [Music] 9 eight seven six five four three two one awesome all right let 's get our balls back okay well done everyone you are working so hard before we keep going have a quick sip of water and we 'll get right back into it don 't forget to drink your water and then you can play okay next one we 're gonna have for childhood she hasn 't been doing so well i mean such a great job this time we 're gonna close our eyes wow that 's kind of tricky but before we do this is another one we have to make sure that we have a lot of space around us if we 're closing our eyes so we 've got to make sure no dogs cats anything we can possibly chip over we 've got to be nice and clean okay okay all right so we 're going to close our eyes and fill and when the ball lands we 're going to go and hatch okay come back to the middle so you 're ready magic mirror close your eyes and you can 't leave until you hear it bounce ready oh i got it you got it eyes closed didn 't get it that 's it keep trying guys throw it up anywhere oh that 's we 're gonna keep it nice and clean ready and that 's it awesome it sounds tricky this is very tricky you guys are going to make such a good job great job if you don 't get it in the first round that 's fine the main thing is to try and get it again that 's it and chasing after that ball ready set awesome and we 'll go i 'm gonna go trick you on wow [Music] oh okay awesome work guys doing really really well okay this next bit is when just gonna use this hole just here and the first one i 'm gonna do is get a ball we 're going to do some passing we 're going to go as fast as we can and with one hand i want to see how many times you can bounce that ball against the wall that 's it try and keep it in your fingertips that 's it nine eight seven six five four three two one okay i 'm gonna switch and do the other side this one can be tricky if this is not your dominant hand ready take it nice and slow big bounces that 's it make sure you do it on a nice solid wall as well so give it a good knock to make sure that it 's a good solid wall okay ten nine eight seven six five four three one well awesome good guys all right the next one we 're going to do is two hands if you can try and make it up nice and high and bring it all the way down and bring it back up nice and 's it doing really well go 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 three two one awesome all right the next one we 're going to do is a little bit tricky but i think it 's really fun we 're going to practice our bounce passes so when you 're playing netball a bounce pass is a good tricky pass to get a round and a defending player so you want to have your one hand on the ball if you can or two hands you step forward and you 're going to fence the ball to another person or in this case the wall okay so i 'm going to step forward bounce and catch and catch once you 've done two you can go to one awesome i 'm gonna try the other side keep going point three two one awesome work guys we can pop our balls down we 're gonna do a couple more things and then we all ready to play a game of netball so magic mirror come back in okay so we 've done our passing we 've done our hand-eye coordination okay so when we defend we have to be three feet now three feet it 's about a meter so if i 'm in here magic mirror it 's about this far away so you 're gonna be this far away and then we put our hands up and try and defend a ball okay so that 's what we 're going to do we 're going to take a step forward so we 've gone up to a player back and meet up and then um it around awesome and we 'll count three two one jump and try and grab that ball okay you ready we 're gonna do it ten times okay ready set go one two three jump awesome work guys let 's do it again one two three jump awesome drink so how high did you jump that was great they 're jumping pretty high okay let 's go come back arms up one two awesome that was number four [Music] jump one two three jump doing real well guys one two three jump three more to go one two three jump awesome one two 're doing so well so we 've done our passing we 're doing our defending mm-hmm get our head our formation the last one is shooting this is a fun one okay all right we can do this at home so we 're going to grab our balls again thank you and when we shoot we 're going to flick our wrist so we 're going to lie down on the ground matching here oh okay okay slide down the ground like all the way back and what you want to do is have your hands up and above and you 're going to flick the ball back to you up high click swing touch what [Music] doing really well try and make sure you hit yourself in the face stick and catch catch click and catch and catch [Music] i can 't wait to see you guys out on the court real soon okay and if it never know what you 're doing that 's okay a lot of these skills work well in basketball as well and a lot of the handbag coordination we said about following the for a lot of sports that you may love okay so i hope you have fun and we 'll see you next time bye you _"

going to get you to do is to stand on one foot okay when you get yourself nice and set you 're going to throw the balls from hand to hand just like this all right all right still standing on the same leg we 're going to try and go the other way so you 'll find one way probably a little bit easier okay all right good let 's change legs so standing on the other foot now we 're gonna go back to our

challenge you can juggle three balls so find three tennis balls or three small objects preferably that won 't break if they hit the floor okay and what i want you to try and do is to juggle three balls at the same time all right see how many you 're able to do one will probably take a little bit more practice so if you find it quite challenging to begin with start with two balls get comfortable with two and then when you feel ready try and add in a third just like that see how many you 're able to do will you be able to do 5 10 or leave you how to master it and maybe do 50 let me

them as we go there 's a play and pause feature at the bottom of the screen if you wish to use it and the forum will also be recorded and short and shared shortly after the event should you experience any technical any technical difficulty difficulties and i 'll now hand over to jen thank you john now firstly the city of parramatta council acknowledges the direct people who are the traditional custodians of the land of parramatta council pays respects to the elders past and present of the diorag nation and extends that respect to other first nations people dialing in today so thank you um for those that have dialed in i 'll now um get into the the presentation and a fair amount of detail given um the audience um so what is the planning proposal the the currently apply to the parramatta cbd which are contained within the paramount local environmental plan 2011. in summary the planning proposal seeks to do a couple of things in the cbd firstly to amend existing controls and secondly to introduce new controls all in all what we 're seeking to do here is to facilitate the delivery of up to 50 000 additional new jobs and 14 000 additional new apartments over the next 40 years um so i 'll start with some background on the project now this project has been going on for a number of years several years in fact and has involved many elements given the complexity of this proposal there have been numerous technical studies unprepared across a range of issues to support the proposal that 's currently on public exhibition and they 've included heritage urban design contamination flood risk infrastructure planning as well as traffic and transport they 've also been many decisions of council at various stages in the process the project has um involved extensive liaison with the department of planning industry and environment and also consultation with key public authorities transport for new south wales and heritage new south wales and finally consultation has also been undertaken with other stakeholders such as community members landowners and industry over the past several years so the so some strategic context for the project the greater sydney commissions and therefore the state government strategies affecting the central city district sees parramatta as the central city for greater sydney placing it very much at its heart this represents a major shift from the previously long-held idea that the sydney cbd will serve as a metropolitan sydney 's major cbd into the future al recently adopted lsps our local strategic planning statement very much supports the state government 's vision that that the paramount cbd forms part of the central city district metropolitan centre so we 're going to start with a broad overview of the planning proposal before i get into the details of it um and and i feel in the details that i 'll be providing we 've identified as those that would benefit some explanation particularly to a group like this so the overview this is a very useful diagram because is the pink box on the top left is very much a component of a broader framework review that the council is undertaking um so all in all we refer to this as the paramount cbd planning framework review and there are three main components to that the first one is the parameter cbd planning proposal which is on exhibition at the moment we are also working on a parramatta cbd infrastructure strategy which will be the subject of a future exhibition and then also an amendment to the parameter dcp to support the amended and new controls that we are proposing within the planning proposal now also an exhibition is the other pink box on the screen which is the draft update of the parramatta floodplain risk management plan and we 'll briefly talk a little bit about that later on and also that also critical to this piece will be an integrated transport plan which again will be placed on public exhibition now these future exhibitions we are at this point hoping to run early next year but those dates have not yet been set um and so elements the cbd palette proposal and then the updated flood risk management plan so this this this diagram very much illustrates the framework that we 're working on and how this all will come together so where will the new controls apply so the planning proposal applies to the areas shown in blue and green on the map on the screen however only the blue area will be subject to change there will be no change no changes are proposed to the planet controls within the green area okay so the blue area is generally bound by church street auto alley to the south the railway line and harris street to the east pennant hills road to the north and marsden street to the west the green area includes parameter park and the park edge highly sensitive area these cr these controls as i mentioned earlier won 't change uh on account of the 2015 conservation agreement that 's been entered into with the state and the federal governments relating to the world heritage listing of old government house and its domain the pink areas that you see to the planning proposal and they will be the subject of further analysis and study separately to this process and they are often referred to as the planning investigation areas so what will the planning proposal seek to do um so there are a couple of slides on this um and i do want to spend some time on it because these are very much our key objectives as a council the first one is to expand the commercial core land zoning now this will increase the commercial amount of floor space therefore bringing an increased amount of jobs to the cbd the b3 commercial call zone is proposed to be increased in size from 22 hectares to 38 hectares that equals about a 75 percent increase um this plant proposal also seeks to increase building heights and floor space ratios which enables more apartments and office towers bringing again more jobs and homes to the cbd it amends the existing bonus floor space controls that encourages high quality design buildings simply called design excellence and also introduces new controls for high performing buildings it also has a fundamental component of it spaces to protect those public spaces particularly in winter and also significant heritage items such as lancer barracks and experiment farm um now the planning proposal does seek to provide incentives uh for additional office and commercial development um to facilitate the um the jobs and the services that we are seeking in the cbd it does require the plain paris does seek to require new mixed-use residential towers to include community infrastructure as part of their development which applies when development is seeking to utilize the additional floor space being offered under the planning proposal now what do we mean by community infrastructure it essentially means things such as community facilities public places and recreation facilities and i 'll get into a little bit more detail on that in a moment the planning proposal does provide controls which aim to protect heritage including additional heritage controls and lower heights in some areas to protect heritage streetscapes or to minimize overshadowing on heritage conservation areas it does require the ground floor or certain buildings to be activated with with activated uses such as cafes and shops so they provide interest proposal also includes the following it does reserve land for road widenings bicycle lanes etc and that 's very important to protect future transport needs particularly when we are proposing to seek density significantly will increase it significantly it does propose lower rates for car park provision similar to those that you 'll find in the sydney cbd now this will help to minimize traffic impacts of new development on the road network and also to encourage greater use of public transport it does provide new controls and a framework to better manage flood risk given that the parameter cbd is located on a flood plain and it also encourages tower design to produce tall but slender forms which is generally associated with a high quality urban design outcome so now i 'm going to focus on some aspects of the planning proposal that might benefit from more from a more detailed explanation i 'll i 'll start with building height controls so you will notice if you have had a look at the planning proposal documentation that there are two height maps in the documentation the first map is reflects the existing height controls in our current lep to a 2011. it does also reflect site-specific pps that have been notified or gazetted up until the 31st of july now there 's also a clause that supports the height of building maps now this essentially just identifies the the base height control that 's applicable to lands within the cbd there 's then a incentive height controls map so the first one was base and this one 's called incentive now this applies to land that is zoned before mixed use and can only be taken up if community infrastructure is provided under the proposed clause 7.6 h now this again is this map again is supported by a clause now you will see that there is a fair amount of uncolored um sites on this map and the reason for that is that these sites are zoned b3 commercial call or have no uplift in heights due to heritage urban design or sun access requirements these are these have all been backed by supporting technical studies and so therefore the maximum heights for these sites are those that base and incentive heights have a maximum mapped height of 211 meters so that 's roughly about 60 stories for a resi building and 53 stories for a commercial building when combined with the design excellence bonus of 15 that will allow buildings up to 243 meters so that 's about 75 stories for a residential building and 60 stories for a commercial building now any height it is important to note that any height in the parramatta cbd that is above 156 meters rl is a controlled activity under the airports act and that therefore requires referral to the relevant airport authorities okay so now i 'll um i 'll cover the floor space ratio controls um these are a little bit more complex than the height controls um but similarly um if you 've had a look at the planning proposal documentation you would have noticed again two height maps a two fsr map sorry there 's a base fsr map and then there 's an incentive fsr map so with the base fsr map um generally again these reflect existing fsr controls that you will see in site-specific pps that have been gazetted or notified since up to the 31st of july the base map is not subject to the fsr sliding scale and again there 's a clause that accompanies this fsr map um so there is also the incentive fsr map this applies for land zones before mixed use and again this can only be taken up if community infrastructure is provided on the sites as described within the clause within the documentation and again this is supported by a clause now you 'll see again similarly with the incentive heights map that there are uncolored sites on this map now that essentially means that those uncoloured sites are essentially those sites that are zoned b3 commercial core or again have no uplift in fsr due to heritage over design or sun access requirements and so therefore the maximum controls that apply there for those sites will be the base fsr map so how do these fsrs work um so to address the increased demand on infrastructure council does need to assist in providing new or enhanced infrastructure and so the provisions within the planning to provide community infrastructure now this community infrastructure includes things such as community facilities public space or recreational facilities on sites now the important point to make here is that prior to completion of the planning proposal council will need to undertake a review of the infrastructure funding framework for the cbd including the preparation of a new development contributions plan to assist in the funding and the delivery of community infrastructure within the cbd particularly when we are seeking a significant increase in dwelling and job numbers over the 40-year period so a bit more on fsrs particularly when it comes to design excellence the the council is very passionate about or raising the bar when it comes to the delivery of design excellence not only through our public domain work than also in buildings so we have revised the design excellence controls as part of this planning proposal so fundamentally our objective is to promote and to secure high quality development it provides a bonus of 15 on on both height and fsr controls where a design competition is held and the final design is considered to achieve seeking as part of this process the the column on the left are the current design excellence triggers and the column on the right are what we are proposing so fundamentally what we 're looking at doing is decreasing the heights of proposals that would trigger the need for a design excellence competition so at the moment if your building is greater than 55 meters you 'd need to go through a design competition process what we 're proposing here is that buildings greater than 40 meters would need to go through a design competition process there are also site requirement sizes that you 'll see on the table between a thousand and eight hundred square meters and also development that 's directly adjoins a heritage item seeking to achieve an fsr of three to one or great and that again is another provision to ensure that our heritage is very well respected and protected [Applause] this planning proposal also seeks to introduce a new provision that 's not currently within our current flight or current planning framework and that 's the high performing buildings clause now it does provide environmental performance above basics and this would apply to sites with the six to one fsr or higher and the bonus fsr is only applicable for residential flat buildings and mixed use developments that includes a residential component mandatory environmental performance requirements for certain commercial buildings are also included the specific requirements include achieving specified targets for energy emissions and water use and this is very much around increasing and elevating the need for better designed and performing buildings particularly from an environmental perspective so there is an opportunity sites map that some of you may have seen within the documentation there this is a new provision which provides a bonus of up to three to one uh on these sides that you 've that are highlighted in beige or yellow but they must meet certain criteria and that relates to design geometry and site size and if that criteria is met that is described within the accompanying clause then that site could benefit from an additional fsr of three to one all right so i 've just gone through a number of maps and bonuses and so we find this all means when put together so the first bar shows where only the base fsr in navy blue and design excellence is used which is in the red in the second and third bars community infrastructure is provided in the development so incentive fsr is added which is the purple as well as bonuses for design excellence in high performing buildings so design excellence in red and high performing buildings in green the third bar shows that if you are a site that 's located on the opportunity sites map and you achieve the criteria within the accompanying clause you could potentially also achieve an additional three to one and that 's located on top of those other bonuses so this is this diagram is explained or a version of this is explained on the material on our website so i encourage you to have a look at how these actually build and and work together um so as soon as as the point i made earlier you know one of the key objectives for us is to facilitate more jobs um and there are also further fsr incentives b4 mixed use zone a minimum one-to-one commercial component is required and any additional commercial above this is exempt from the overall fsr calculations and for those that are following that relates to clause 7.6 c in the b3 commercial core office developments is exempt from fsr controls and so very much the the fundamental control there is height now for the key issue the key point here is that for both of these incentives to operate um the site needs to be a minimum area of 1800 square meters now with regards to sun access provision this is something that council considers critical to the success and the growth of the cbd particularly from an amenity perspective now um the planning proposal does provide solar access protection particularly to public open space in parameter square prince alfred square the part of the paramount river foreshore in jubilee park also heritage items in curtin lancer barracks and the experiment farm the the plane proposal introduces a new sun access protection map and generally speaking um mid-winterism is the measure um that we 've utilized to ensure that there is appropriate this is this is critical for parramatta for two reasons firstly there are many heritage sites in and adjacent to the cbd and secondly the cbd also butts an important internationally significant heritage precinct being old government house and its domain so what are we doing in this pp to protect heritage so we have sought to apply lower heights in fsrs in certain cases to minimize impact on heritage some examples of where we 've done this include the western end of the great western highway to protect solar access to south parramatta heritage conservation area church streets to protect heritage the heritage streetscape northern and western areas immediately adjoining st john 's cemetery to minimize impacts to the heritage cemetery there is also amending the trigger for design competition which i mentioned earlier so any significant buildings next to heritage items would be required to undertake a design competition we have also introduced a new clause in addition to the existing standard template clause of 5.10 in the existing lep um now that very much that very much relates to ensuring that there are heads of considerations that a dna and so the details of that are in the documentation if you 're particularly interested in that there are also special provision controls um relating to the preservation of and again you know no changes to the edge highly sensitive area and also identifying certain sites on the special provisions area map sun access is also protected for certain heritage conservation areas that would have affected that would have been affected if we didn 't lower some of the heights particularly on the the eastern edge of the cbd um and heritage items that are within the lep 2011 are retained within this planning proposal so as i mentioned earlier the paramount cbd is located on the floodplain and so we need to demonstrate how an increa how increased density can be accommodated on the floodplain while still addressing and minimizing stormwater and flood risk so there is a we are proposing a new clause within the documentation the new clause applies to land affected by the probable maximum flood now our our strategy here is to allow for shelter in place now all sites must have an to manage secondary risks we do have provisions in the clause and the documentation to ensure that all sites also need to withstand the forces of flood waters and debris and this is supported by the revised flood risk management plan that is also on public exhibition so overall the proposal provides a number of benefits in summary improved environmental outcomes through a new high performing buildings clause and better flood risk management very much suited and tailored for parramatta more opportunities for jobs and businesses particularly when looking at the increased fsas and incentivizing commercial developments protecting connecting community infrastructure to the provision of increased yields improving urban design outcomes particularly around street activation solar access and design excellence and including new protections for heritage through new controls now um so i 'll briefly cover almost at the end here about the community engagement program and how we 're actually engaging with the community and industry so we are holding a six week six week exhibition period so two weeks longer than what we would ordinarily have to do given the climate that we 're in the the conclusion submissions are due by that dance so you will you will see that there are a number of ways that we are engaging and communicating this important piece of work um there 's obviously a lot of information on the council 's website we have notified just shy of 30 000 households and businesses notifying them of the exhibition and there 's obviously summary sheets of fact sheets that have been produced we 're holding this forum i 'm also participating in a range of other forums that i 've been invited to there are community question and answer sessions too that have been organized phone a planner if you 've got a specific question about the cbd ppp there 's an opportunity to actually make a booking and to speak to a planner directly there 's also social media activity and we 've also notified key stakeholders that we 've been working with over the past several years letting them know of the exhibition period so in terms of next steps um this is a time frame that most people that are quite active in development within the cv so with a exhibition concluding in november and really depending on the volume and the nature of the submissions we receive we are proposing to report the outcome of that public exhibition to the local planning panel early in the new year there will need to obviously be a consultation with our counselors through that process um following um the lpp report there will be a report to council on the exhibition outcomes um and we 're aiming for a march report there that will then allow you know a few months for the legal drafting to occur and liaison with the department of planning to then conclude this process so thank you very much john i 'll now hand it back to you well thanks jen um we 'll now be opening up for questions and we can use the q a function to put a question this form please enter your question in text obviously um through the q a section button that 's the button with the two balloons the question mark um so please i hope you 've remembered your questions and you 're using that will run till two but if we have a backlog we 'll extend the humanoid session slightly before we wrap up and council has given the commitment to follow through the questions that we can 't get to if there are any um while we 're waiting for for the questions to come through i might just ask jen if she can kick off with her understanding of in total what would you say councils looking to achieve through the the cbd planning proposal um i would i think the key the key aspect of it is fundamentally cementing cbd as the genuine jobs and housing hub of central city the planning controls that we have at the moment for the most part that 's been demonstrated through this process are outdated and not quite aligned with the strategic objectives of both the council and the state government and so there is a significant push because there 's significant value in concentrating high density living and job growth within the heart of cbd of parramatta and so the key objective here is to highlight and cement the cbd status um by facilitating greater job growth and greater residential growth over a period of time this is a long-term plan it 's a 40-year plan we don 't expect this to be delivered tomorrow within the next five years but it is very important very wise for there to be a long-term strategic plan to achieve that objective thanks jen look there are some elements of your presentation that are familiar to some of the viewers about what 's been happening so far in the cbd does the the planning proposal reflect the direction that council 's been following for the cbd for say the last five years and is anything marketed different um i wouldn 't say anything 's remarkably different and the core of your question is you know have we been kind of consistent in our focus and application yes we have been this planning proposal is very much a complex one that 's why it has partly taken us some time and because there 's been a significant amount of engagement and interest by stakeholders and also the need to prepare technical studies to ensure that the we haven 't_''_2094.32 you know our objective and our principles have been consistent over the past several years and they are now consistently placed within our strategic projects that are future looking right um i might before i might just ask how how will you spend quite a bit of attention on the floor space and higher incentives um just in total without going into the detail how collectively will those floor space and height incentives achieve a community a net community benefit to the city without going to the detail the fundamental component of that is that it is linked to community infrastructure and its delivery and so it the the planning proposal has been specifically designed to have both base height and fsi controls and incentive height and fsr controls and to be able to be able to access the incentive height and fsr controls proponents will need to demonstrate how they 're actually going to provide community benefit by way of delivering community infrastructure on their sites so that is fundamentally how it 's linked right so we have some questions coming in um what is the um that 's a good question i 'd probably say there are very few elements to that that i touched on in the presentation the first one is solar access and so having a very specific focus on solar access to protect amenity within the cbd has been critical for us not only to open space public open space but also to heritage items i would also include heritage in that heritage adds a significant amount of value to the amenity of a city and a reflection of its history really and so we do have new controls within the planning proposal that seek to further protect heritage and design excellence we 've also revised our kind of triggers in the design excellence clause to ensure more developers go through the design excellence process as we see value in that also well thanks jen um in terms of utilities at what point will all the utilities collaborate so that they can maximize their presence and give effect to the planning proposal and its outcomes so through this engagement process we are consulting with a whole range of public authorities including us to engage with utilities at this strategic planning process and we are doing that at the moment they 'll always have a role at the development assessment stage but we 're trying to see how much of that we can actually bring at the front end through the strategic planning phase and was the capacity of infrastructure uh the nature of utilities planning for the cbd a major constraint or concern um it was a it was a concern it is something that we have investigated in in great detail um however and also had previous conversations with some of the utilities as we 've been developing um the planning proposal over the past few years and i guess uh the the given that the city is on a flood plain that is a really important planning consideration i understand the approach that you 've taken around managing refuge and around the the design provisions in the planning proposal recognize that is is has the understanding of the nature of flooding in parramatta shaped the planning proposal to a a great degree um it has when it 's come given the nature of the cbd its location the intensity of development that we are proposing all being in line with you know council and state government objectives there is a strong desire and need to support further growth of the cbd unfortunately it does sit within the flood plain and so therefore we need to manage that risk very carefully given the nature of the floods that occur within parramatta they they do um you know they are fast floods they recede quite quickly um and so we have done all the technical investigations and have the advice that shelter in place in this instance is uh is workable within parramatta and something that we should continue to investigate so that 's really the kind of the philosophy that 's behind the flood risk management plan that 's currently on public access and i assume you mean shelter in places stay where you are that 's right and so what we are looking as part of the building designs to ensure that there are components of buildings that facilitate that common area so people can seek refuge here within recede and how will growth in the cbd impact transport and i guess that works two ways in terms of the supply of transport infrastructure and also demand for the use of transport yeah so with a significant increase in density you know if we don 't have a significant mode shift to public transport or a significant decrease in the provision of car parking our roads themselves will become car parks and so um i think that 's one key component that we 've been focusing on in particular one of the key provisions within our planning proposal is to lower car parking rates yeah okay um as you know most people are aware there 's been a significant investment in public transport in parramatta with parameter light rail and sydney metro and so significant mode shift to infrastructure like that will assist in managing transport now the integrated transport plan that we 're also working on will bring all this together i mean highlight the need for that mode shift to public transport and support the need to reduce car parking and is any aspect of the planning at this stage it 's not however what it does highlight is that there 's a significant deficit in local community infrastructure that needs to be provided to support the incoming population that will result from this increased density so that is why community infrastructure is linked to the incentive fsr and height maps and i guess uh broadly linked to the transport question is one around pedestrian amenity that 's been asked here has council considered pedestrian amenity and how would this be managed um in relation to the increased residential densities yeah absolutely so there 's probably two components to this um we do require street activation so i touched on that briefly in the presentation where there is a specific map within the lep that requires street activation along many streets within the cbd to provide increased amenity for pedestrians we are very mindful as part of our pedestrian strategy that the volumes of pedestrians within our cbd will increase significantly significantly over a period of time and so we are also looking at road widening to not only facilitate more roads but wider footpaths for example been very important to ensure that not only pedestrians but those that want to sit outside and have their lunch in the sun can do so you know with a high level of amenity one of the questions here relates to a question i asked earlier and that 's around how do high yields deliver community benefits and i asked a similar question around you ultimately the height and floor space incentives are intended to in total deliver an advantage for the cbd and i guess if you isolate the individual uh incentives and you do your yield calculations obviously a greater yield will be possible in those incentive sites or where there 's a design and excellence competition but i guess what the question the question is is will that deliver benefit for the community will that extra yield combined with that excellence uh deliver another overall benefit well in the view of the council yes because that incentive fsi that extra yield can only be accessed if community infrastructure is provided if community infrastructure is not provided you can 't access the additional fsr the two are intrinsically planning proposal um so we i think the first space was essentially a study of the existing heights um in comparison of that together with the existing floor space ratios we also considered that that was done through significant urban design analysis around what appropriate heights should be located where within the cbd we also considered the solar access to open space and key heritage areas including items and conservation areas that has very much impacted the location of specific heights in the cbd we then have considered aviation limits so what are the genuinely maximum heights that can potentially be achieved you will see on the maps um i think the color is black being the highest height that could be actually located within the cbd um when you actually consider urban design analysis solar access um and so forth that you 'll see that there are some lower heights but there are also some sites within the cbd that can potentially actually access quite significant homes and do you i recall during your presentation you mentioned that there 'll still be a referral requirement for some of the how that 'll play out um will there be uh another bite at the cherry from the aviation authorities on on heights well there shouldn 't be because we 're engaging with them now and so the whole and this is the second time we 've engaged with them we have spoken to them in depth previously about setting these heights they have been revised and for anyone that has been following this planning proposal journey will see that we have very much refined the heights that are now proposed um so um they have an opportunity to speak now and i and we 'll be encouraging them to do so okay and i notice there 's a question there how um state agencies are being involved so we 've we 've been engaging with quite a number of state government agencies for some time um the transfer for new south wales and rms and department of planning are the key ones um including the department of heritage new south wales so there have been several that we 've we 've taken on the journey through this process um we the the nature of this planning proposal have engaged with many state government agencies and continue to do so right now there 's a question about uh why some areas are not in the planning proposal yes i think so that question might relate to the pink areas i showed earlier in the presentation there 's an area down at west auto alley in north parramatta um now those areas are located on the periphery of the cbd between very much high density either commercial residential development within the cbd next to a heritage conservation area and it 's land between that now they have not been included because the council feels that further work needs to be done on that and so um we do we will be doing further work on those precincts and they 'll be run as a separate process look i 've got a question about the um the the heights and floor space incentives the collectively there 's quite a yield advantage to participate in the incentive incentives on offer do you think that yield advantage will be supported by the market do you design excellence the incentives the uh the additional high performance building um opportunities in terms of market testing do you think these yield opportunities through the controls and the planning proposals will continue to be attractive i believe so and the reason for that is because we have quite a number of site-specific planning proposals that we have either already assist in support and have been notified or in the process of assessing at the moment that are largely consistent with the the provisions within the planning proposal and so that tells me that there 's an acceptance and an interest in complying with the provisions within the cbd ppp a lot of these developments that have resulted in a notified planning proposal have actually progressed to a design competition and a da there are a couple that are starting to be built now so that 's evidence to show that we are on the right track that they 're the right numbers the right height the right density and so forth there 'll always need to be probably you know an opportunity for us to refine but that 's dcp process and also through the da process have there 's a question there relates to the heat island effect has the analysis around the planning proposal taken the heat the potential heat island effect of the development outcomes from the planning proposal into account yeah so there 's been been a fair amount of work done around the high performing buildings clause now that is a new clause that i haven 't come across very much um in other leps particularly in high density leps or particularly in you know central and western sydney and that very much does focus on ensuring that buildings are designed in a way that minimizes the heat island effects particularly when you are dealing with you know particular materials air conditioning and the like right and uh there 's a question there relates to that quantum of housing that will be the yield that will be achieved under the planning proposal and how the quantum of housing that might be possible under the planning proposal meets or addresses council and gs the greater sydney commission 's targets for the district yeah so under dwellings within the cbd over a 40-year period this the paramount local government area is set to double in population over the same period of time or roughly the same period of time which is significance and there are key precincts within the primary local government area including this this parramatta cbd that will contribute to achieving our housing target we will and truly achieve the housing target within parramatta when focusing on particularly the precincts that we 've already identified through our lsps and local housing strategy and the cbdp plays a significant role in that proportionally most or some uh i wouldn 't say most i would say some right um we 've got a question about the design excellence clause as one if you could elaborate on how that 's to be achieved yes certainly so we 've had a design excellence clause within the parameter cbd and how it 's developed as well where it came from yes certainly so the design excellence clause has been within the parameter lep for some time several years in fact we have a city architect and a small team design excellence competitions in in the states which is a reflection of the interest um and and the rising design excellence bar within parramatta which is excellent so the clause i believe is a standard clause and what we 've done and given that we have run quite a number of designing some competitions that we 've we 've used our learnings through that process to identify what further improvements or changes should we be making to the clause to further rise uh increase or rise the bar increase the bar of design excellence within the cbd and so the other things that we 're particularly focusing on we should be putting more buildings through the design excellence process because we see significant value through that and what sort of things have happened or that can you see what type of characteristics of buildings that have been through that process are you seeing what what features in them so improved quality when it comes to design public domain materials finishes we 've we 've included processes to ensure that those elements that are secure at the design competition process are and occupation certificate to make sure that design is not dumbed down okay so you couldn 't spot the difference looking at a building that is our aim and that is what we 're working very very hard to achieve now there 's a question about covert and i guess whether the planning proposal has been pressure tested against a covert future uh or a list of changes that we understand might be happening with uh covert and actually interestingly today the greater city commission published a report around the planning implications for covert but the question is would covert have an impact on the planning proposal vision um i look i i don 't believe so um there 'll always need to be um a need to address the demand for jobs um i think what may we haven 't seen any substantial changes over this period of time over the past six or seven months as we 've been experiencing covert in the nature of the design or demand for commercial office space within parramatta it has um interestingly and surprisingly been the same but only time will so at this point in time i don 't see that there will be any significant impacts and if there are we 'll just need to consider those as we go through the process and i guess it 's a follow-on question the one there about jobs um uh how is council encouraging jobs for the central city central city cbd through the planning proposal um by providing increased density and incentives um that that 's a significant part of it we 're still seeing commercial buildings going up we 're still seeing da 's coming in for commercial buildings uh we still we 're seeing it we 're still seeing a consistent interest in the development of commercial buildings within the cbd which is excellent um in terms of supporting jobs we 're through this planning proposal where increasing the the commercial core area by about 75 there we have commercial incentives and we also have unlimited office space fsrs um in the commercial call which is at the heart of the cbd so um like i would have thought also that the jobs are attracted to the amenity a whole range of connected decisions for the cbd is there is there an interest that you 're hearing from uh employers in locating a high amenity cbd yeah absolutely you know the the feedback and the requests that we certainly receive is that a lot of investors in particular are very interested and supportive of other initiatives that the council are working on so for example revitalizing the river because that has a significant role when it comes to amenity particularly for securing um employees public transport is a significant part of that as well people want to be able to easily access their job or their place of employment and and and beautiful and activated streets are also critical in that and so we do have a very long term vision we are working on that we are upgrading significant streets like phillips street at the moment paramount light rail when it 's finished will not only provide a vital public transport connection but also revitalized streets and i guess flowing from that um in the future there will be future announcements and discussions around major particularly transport potential metros west metro uh potential or you know ring roads in the vicinity of parramatta will the plan be flexible or will it take into account those future potential pieces of infrastructure as much as possible at the moment yes and like any planning instruments it will be the subject of review and as commitments are made to major infrastructure in the future we would have to obviously need to make sure that our plans are up to date and and reflect that infrastructure but at this point in time yes it does acknowledge the current commitments of the government and also the council okay thank you very much uh jennifer i i think it 's it 's time to to wrap up the q a session and thank you very much for all of those questions and if there are others council have made a commitment to follow them through um as i 've noted in introduction the forum is being recorded and we 'll share this with all the uh the registered guests and uh i understand the planning proposal is on exhibition until the 2nd of understand you 've uh you 've seen the web link that 's available for submissions so i myself and jen would very much like to thank you for attending this forum and thank you for your interest in this city shaping project thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "okay i 'm going to start now all right i 'm going i 'm going to just make sure my camera setting is set for this lighting condition indoor fluorescent light two lights here looks beautiful one 's ghost image and on the lens not bad making sure my camera is sometimes when i look back on an image it 's steady it 's not as good as i remember it to be but this one 's not bad it moved the light really crouching down this looks this is not good it 's not very natural looks like i 'm trying too hard i mean this is better it 's always good to move around just to see what other possibilities that you can photograph it in but some but usually the first kind of glimpse at something it 's probably it 's the right it 's the right position to stand so yeah i think that 's it i got it so there 's a stack of chairs in that room there that i really like the pattern of um and i 'm going to go in there i like the patterns that it 's creating here let me see where i need to stand to get the best shot of this and i really like that door and that hallway there it 's this part here that i 'm really interested in this pattern here and this is black lines coming across it 's creating a really graphic kind of could be a really graphic image but the light 's not good here so i 'm just gonna i think i could move it it 's gonna move over there the lights a lot better here over there or maybe well hang on maybe in here would this work whoa okay wait the shelves that looks no that 's not gonna work that looks terrible this is me moving the chairs around okay looking for the perfect spot to photograph the chairs in so i 'm looking for the the ideal angle or um or the ideal background or sometimes i 'm looking at a looking for a better light condition um when you photograph something the first time you come across it might not be the move the object around or you might want to move yourself around that could be amazing i 'll switch this off thanks matt touch it off let me stand back here i need to be more this thing here this thing this line here needs to be like on that corner here just make it really graphic if i can see if i can line it straight almost there okay yeah that looks really good why is it good because symmetry balance and line all come together a little bit better what i saw in my mind 's eye it 's all appearing in front of me i might try a few different angles maybe one just right here because i can see a nice pattern from here get one wide so i can see the four corners in the room and get one i 'm zooming in and i 'm a lot closer get it centered hold myself steady trying to brace myself against my knee so there 's no camera shake because the light is quite low check the image oh it 's terrible not it 's not it looks pretty good but i think the best photo is probably here fill the frame a bit whoa okay cut down low feel the frame when i 'm photographing things like this i like to keep it i mean i could i could like move the chairs around the whole you know try a different room like all sorts of stuff but i kind of dislike it in its own environment if that makes sense like within kind of you know i don 't want to how do i explain i don 't want to um turn it into a prop does it make sense yeah i 'm not trying to do it turning into a pro i 'm just trying to take photographs about the things that i find in its environment i try to keep it as natural as i can and i don 't want to manipulate the scene too much so even though i move the chair from that little space to here even doing that it 's a little bit i 'm kind of like pushing my boundary a little bit you know i what can i do can is there a shadow that i can play with here no that 's not working all right i got the shot i think i 'm gonna it 's always important to take back put back the equipment where you found it i 'm just constantly looking out for patterns things that might go together well or might like to go together so i 'm looking at patterns on the roof here get a photo of the the room with all the shapes there 's kind of circular shapes in the room on the ceiling here now where should i stand for this maybe i need to lie down on the ground it 's probably the best way get that really low oh yeah this angle yep maybe on the corner here so i can get all of that oh yeah down here okay sometimes you need to get it really low get the shot well it looks pretty cool okay adjust my setting a little bit but it 's too bright because the light 's shining directly in my camera wow that 's nice i room in because when you walk into the room there 's nothing in the room it 's pretty much empty so um you know there 's nothing to move you know the only thing you can do is you move you know so if you want a different perspective if you want to show someone um a different view of this room what you can do is one of the things you can do is you can move your body around and you know and different angles is one of the ways you know probably the easiest and quickest way to get a photo of of a room that everyone knows pretty well but if you get down really low or get down really high you can show that room in a different different light in a different way that people haven 't seen before you know you can emphasize something that people haven 't seen before when i 'm proposing the image i i would see something that i automatically want to photograph and i know why i want to photograph it so when i 'm composing the image make it as clear as possible for the viewer to understand what i 'm looking at you 're you 're in this room and you 're trying to make the best photograph you can in this space given what you have right so i 'm in this room it 's empty there 's nothing here so for me the most interesting thing in the room that i could see at the moment is the roof i 'm just trying to find something that 's out of place that 's not right there 's a bit quirk here there 's a bit different you know that makes the space kind of special to me you know and hopefully other people find special my photography is walking around with a small camera and just really looking and being in the space and appreciating you know what it 's given to me and then trying to make the best of what i have in front of me you know and not so much um setting something up and yeah it 's like you 're an explorer i mean this camera really allows you lives you know um you know so many things you know it gives you access it 's like a key you know it 's a key to you know be inquisitive and be interested and it 's the key to allow other people into your world too you know you have control of what you allow people into your but it 's a key to show people what you 're passionate about what your interests are you know how you feel about certain things you know it 's a key to communicate you know it 's that bridge the camera is the bridge that links you to the outside world you know you can show them as much or as little as you like you know it 's beautiful in that way nice work you _"

big deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth and again in through your nose out through your mouth this time when you breathe in try and hold it for three seconds in through your nose I hope you all had a chance to practice your challenge for last week just to review what I wanted you to do was to stand on one foot close your eyes and pass an object around your body just like so for as many times as you could until you had to stop how many into an exercise that 's going to challenge your balance it 's quite a heel to toe walk imagine you 're trying to walk on a tightrope or walking along a line okay so walking hero to toe nice and steady nice and slow making sure your heel touches your toe with each step turn around and come back nice and slow all right if you found that quite easy what I want you to do now is to try and do backwards so exact same thing walking heel to toe as if you 're walking along the line but backwards then you get the end turn around and coming back nice and steady nice too slow excellent all right to make that alluvion harder again what I want you to do is to close your eyes when you 're doing this though make sure you 're next to a wall or next to something that you can just grab onto if you need to to stop because you 've lost your balance a little bit so what we 're going to do is heel to toe walking with your closing your eyes and walking all right and then get to the end if you really want to make it hard try and go backwards as well as you can see a little bit unsteady which is fine but just make sure you 're doing it next to a wall in case you need to grab yourself today we introduced push-ups off the floor so my challenge for you for the next week is to see how many pushups you can do in one here are you going to be able to do 10 are you going to be worked able to work up to 20 see how many you can do give it a practice throughout the week and let me know next week how do you what we 're going to do now is a progression on from last week when we do that boxing and out jumping so as you can see on the floor in front of me here I have some socks lined up they gave to make a ladder what we 're going to get you to do is to create that with about like to put on the floor what are you going to do is then run through them placing both feet in between each marker so it should look like this okay when you get to the end stop turn around and go again excellent if you found that relatively easy try and go a little bit quicker all the way to the end turning around and going back excellent we 're also going to do some boxing so what we 're going to do is a comet call it a combination so you 're going to go straight punch straight punch cross and up okay let 's do that again straight straight cross and up

    "text": "[Music] Peter joy Rodrigo ami gay so the day is good my name is Peter joy and I 'm a Roger he got when a girl my family come from a little town called Trang II which is about 45 minutes out of Davao and today I 'm going to do some demonstrations on weaving some technical things that I 've been taught by Rodri elders and just some basic skills that of things that you can do around your house okay so we 're going to start off we 're going to make a bangle which will look like this we start off with the core of raffia now today I 've got some pretty color so I 'm going to actually use that instead of just plain raffia and we 're going to wrap it around our hand and each time we wrap it we 're going to pull it tight wrapping it pulling it tight wrapping it bling it tight we do this until we have it all bundled together so it looks like so then with our colored piece or you can use wool or string suits we 're going to tie a single knot like we do with our shoes so that 's all bundled together and we 're going to sort of tuck this little end piece underneath what we 're doing okay with that we 're going to create a loop on top with that loop on top we 're going to pull the piece of string through creating a tight knot and we 're going to continue to do that over and over again until we cover the whole raffia with our color so I 'll do this for a while and then I 'll talk to you some more so I first learnt to weave traditional baskets in a row a jury of country conference that my cousin mark had put on and I learnt from a Roderick elder named Annie Lorraine tie and so I like to credit her wherever I can for my weaving skills and from that I 've been able to teach hundreds of people basics all the way up to skilled things I created a major piece for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs at the end and this can be actually seen on the little flyer next to me the piece that I created had a whole story to it that talks about how through our own self-determination people are finally starting to listen to us and stead of telling us what we want they 're listening to what we want so weaving for me is something that I find quite relaxing it 's something I can do while I 'm sitting in front of the TV or you know talking to friends I find when I do yeah weaving with a group of people it becomes a bit of a yawning circle and you talk about things that you wouldn 't normally talk about so you get to know each other a little bit different to your everyday you become so relaxed that you just have this magic happen where you get comfortable and and kind of a little bit Zen so as you can see I 've got quite a small part done it takes a bit of time but when you 're actually weaving baskets depending on the size that you 're making fundamentals of what we would be doing if we were making a basket except we 'd be joining these loops with the part on top so you can see in this piece but I 've started that it 's joined together through those loops that we 're making on top so over the years I 've done many art exhibitions and projects I have several murals around like hard in the eastern suburbs where I reside I work over at Olympic Park so I kind of feel like I 'm a little bit connected to this area because of what I get to do and where my office is it 's really I really enjoy sharing my skills and knowledge with people and showing them new techniques and things I think it 's great when we share our our knowledge rather than trying to keep them to ourselves because over time if we don 't share what we 've got it eventually gets lost like our a language Nellie did and I 've been fortunate that I could go and learn my language at tafe in Dubbo and reconnect to I actually felt like I 'd put a piece of my puzzle back in that was missing for a really long time I picked it up really well but my son he was quite young at the time did the classes with me and he actually picked it up and speaks it more fluently than I do and I think it 's so nice that we still speak language at home and we 're in the process of teaching other family members to to see those words and learn those things so my son being a dancer he actually writes his own songs in language and sings them so learning that has been a big thing for him and it 's also helped with his confidence our culture is so important and it doesn 't matter about where you come from it 's about making sure you have that connection to that home place so growing up in the eastern suburbs of Sydney I spent a lot of my time at the beach and I always feel at home there and the only other place they feel at home is by the going in which but recent years has been quite dry so I found out the other day that there 's water in it again and it actually is a nice feeling to know that so I 'm looking forward to my next visit to home country I think it 's important that we go home and recharge once in a while and the story on my shirt the design on that is my design and it 's actually called grounded in water so whenever I get the chance I always like to put my feet in the water Therese into myself and connect again and make myself feel cleansed or grounded so some of the artworks that you see around me what I could scrounge up from my home I was lucky enough to a couple of years ago being invited by the Balmain Tigers local Football Club to design a football jersey for them and so this is actually last year 's Jersey but I 've done three will design for but unfortunately due to covert the fourth design hasn 't been made yet but I do eventually for me big fan of the Balmain Tigers local club I always like to give them a bit of a plug because they 've plugged me for the last four years so that was that piece this piece is called war cry and when I I mentioned before that my son 's a dancer he actually performed a war cry at the beginning of that game and there 's a beautiful photo of him high-fiving one of the players wearing my Jersey and he 's got this mad hair and he 's all painted up he needs any some gear so it was it was really beautiful next to it is an emu egg which is called shared knowledge and it 's about those little droplets of knowledge that start off in a little pond and they expand and grow and the little spirit figures that are there are the carriers of that knowledge and making sure that it goes on so a lot of my work tell stories I call myself a visual storyteller because I can 't create something without having a reason behind it some people here is my skateboard this was done by a company called Prince Albert skateboards unfortunately they didn 't take off all that well so not a lot of these were made but it was a painting of mine called green fairy which they lazy printed into the deck and and sold off and there 's a little symbol on there so to give one back for every deck they sold they planted a tree to you know put back some wood in the forests and things so that was a nice gesture and that was done quite a few years ago now and this painting here is probably one of my recent pieces which I designed for the program I work on called lead with culture and the middle circles are those droplets of water that same as the egg which is that knowledge that we all share around there next circle is the footprints going in an anti-clockwise motion that anti-clockwise motion is a ceremonial thing it 's also representative of going back in time the line work that Sundra represents walking across country so it 's basically saying outside circle with those boomerang shapes or what some people refer to as jellybean shapes is the elders the spirits of those elders still looking down on us and you know keeping that knowledge intact so without our ancestors we wouldn 't be where we are today and they are always important to be represented in in things like that that 's the story of that piece so as you can see I 've gotten a fair bit done now and this has taken probably about what 10 15 minutes so far my piece I 've actually intentionally let it wrap around and give it that sort of bit of twist some people like to keep it just on top or just on the inside that 's entirely up to you and your creativity so these we 're sort of made for a little bit of fun for dress ups and things like that so it 's just like a bangle or an armband so you can make them larger to sit on top of your arm you can add feathers to them if you like or seashells so one to give us gifts for my fascinations friends in Spokane and so I put seashells and bits and pieces to give them a piece of Australia when I gave them these bangles so feathers and and bits and pieces I 'd collected for them my son used to use these for his dancing I used to make them make a whole bunch for him to erroneous arms and things with the feathers but then I found out that he was actually giving them away when he finished dancing so I told him how to make and now he has to make him himself so it was quite funny I caught him giving it to a girl one time so just to you know try and sweeten her up a little bit but yeah so there pretty simple to make and as I said you can use anything you like to make them when I make these with younger children I actually get the little bangle you can buy in the the packs for party bags so you get about six in a packet and we just do the same technique of a stable foundation to to be able to do it without any drama these ones are a little bit tricky because you get little bits and pieces sort of sticking out which can be frustrating for people but we just trim them off when it 's finished and it will come good so nearly there yeah this is something you could definitely do at home and like some of the stuff you could do is like using ribbon so if you 've got like if it was after Christmas or something and you had a lot of gifts that were covered in ribbons and things you could definitely make make him out of ribbons I had a friend who had a baby shower and we collected all the ribbons and I I wove it into a basket for her so all the ribbons from all of the gifts were put into a basket using this very similar technique but making more of that basket shape so you know you 're basically only blocked by your imagination so if you think about it you can definitely make it so that anything creative I am I tend to you know visualize things and try and remake them but if it doesn 't quite turn out sometimes it actually turns out a little bit better than what I 'd imagined sometimes not so much but it 's just trial and error and it 's more about the relaxation and having than it is about anything else so I enjoy it so we 've just run out of raffia which is really annoying because I only got that much to go but I 'll cut myself another small piece and show you how to add so all we 'll be doing is tying a knot over that piece so it 'll be tucked in my raffia is a slightly different color to the original one I was using but no one will notice so we 're going to tuck that little tail beading underneath and continue our weaving and to add feathers and things like that we would just sort of set them on top of where we 're weaving and let them sort of being bettered so I would probably do two in place and then they tend to stay so you can use any kind of feathers you like as long as they 're culturally appropriate for who you are but definitely if it 's something that you want to decorate them with it 's something you can do just tucking these little bits in which I 'll trim off in the end so I 've done weaving workshops all over Sydney and one I did for the Department of Environment and planning was in this CBD office but from that I actually created from all their little weaving pieces that they 'd created the little spirals I made an eel for it to be hung in there Parramatta office so from what I 've been told it 's hanging in the Parramatta office now pride of place and you can actually see the eel had emerging from the rocks from that weaving piece that I created well the team at environmental implanting created and I just pulled it all together so it 's lots of fun I love going around and showing my skills off so we 're almost finished do depending on how fast you go or if you want to space it out a little bit it can take longer or shorter because I 've got quite a lot of experience in weaving I tend to get them done relatively quickly and so hopefully this is something that you 'll learn to you can pick up at home and do yourself just have a little bit of fun with it I have a Facebook page called the rotary wave so if you 'd like to see more of my work or have a send me a message on how to do other skills and things I 'm more than happy to answer any questions that 's okay to say that so just as I 'm coming towards the end of this what I do with the very end of it and if only if you can is grab a needle you 'll probably need a needle with a large I I buy plastic needles for my weaving for when I 'm doing my baskets and dings so they 're really hard to find at the moment but when needle is just something like that we 're going to need to thread the raffia through or the color or the string whatever it is you 're using and just stitch it underneath those couple of stitches to tuck it under if you cut it off next to it there 's a chance that along Ravel so that 's just going to secure it like so so if I cut that off there it 's not going to come unraveled and these little bits that are sticking out all also trim off so that 's the demonstration on how to make a bangle and I 'll show you once I 've trimmed it up so from just some plain raffia to this you [Music] _"

    "text": "so we might just have a quick yarn about this beautiful Baker so of course there 's many colors of ochre on country and don 't quite revered really um for the beauty of the pigment not just for art making but also for ceremony and there was also some health and well-being uses for okay and so Parramatta and Sarah was quite well known as white pipe clay that was found in this areas being one of the purest white clay that come across and that was also found in other Aboriginal nations outside of Sydney so that revealed that the clay had being traded over long distances and so there was an active very active exchange of trade that was happening for thousands of years with during people and other nations Ganon and Guerra went to get up over the mountains past and it out past the flat lands you get into go in Agoura country and then when you go down a bit more you sort of more enduro war country and the case going more into Newcastle people so people would go out travelling for thousands trade and so that was a pretty frequent sort of thing of trading them materials and people there would be marriages and there would be songs exchanged their news stories and so that would have been a lovely time and of course the Whale ceremony is a big part of that say we still now observe the practice to the remaining of the time when the whales will migrate girl were part of that whale ancestral creation that still the whales come every year so it 's beautiful to see you know there 's many indications and of our living cultures today and the Elwell 's are still here and you know we 're still going on country and we 're keeping those skills and knowledge is alive what I 'd like to sort of talk about as well is a philosophy around ways of of seeing and being on country so in my teachings I talk about on seeing country here in country and speaking country so I 'll sail with you now those words in keynote indirect so what we say when we say na so we say need to visualize now and nura country so we see now mirror we see country now on Europe with Nara yeah it means deep listening you know unknowingly a deep lessly you know in a profound personal spiritual way so that we 're not only listen we there is it 's not a just a auditory um way of hearing but hearing as in understanding so we we now first Narnia Lara Lara the word ng that begins at the frontal of that word is is particularly associated with Aboriginal words and it 's one of the main phonetics when we put ng at the sound of C see so it 's the ng syllable that you 'll hear and what happens is the the back of the tongue is at the roof of the mouth and then releasing so we 're pushing the sound up through the nose to get the it 's almost like a hump and a lot of people struggle with that in Aboriginal languages so but that 's just like with any language that has a particular nuance to it that we will learn so mera mera mera and the Derg word for speech is B Allah be Allah be Allah so we be Allah Neera be Allah nearer so we na na we see country nari nareh we hear country and we be all on you and so just within those three very deeply embedded sentences with we 're talking about building a relational deep connection with our and humanity and with Mother Earth and how we clean ground ourselves in well-being at any time to build a relationship and see ourselves as part of this ecosystem and playing a very important part of the well-being of of our environment and our animals and our species so I feel very privileged to have you know being able to continue to learn and uncle max is also one of my senior uncle max Dillon one-one Harrison is also one of my senior elder xand teachers that I continue to learn from and then this fan Annie Annie Phyllis Stewart who 's continuing to teach me now I 'm an advanced master weaver but I 'm still learning under your seeing you master weavers so it know in all of and privileged to share thank you yeah I know [Music] you [Music] _"

would have talked about our culture because if we did we got punished for that one of the punishment was they used to sing you down the line and if your brother or cousin didn 't_''_200.86 they go send down the line on yourself still catch it up with more culture and more other background yeah that she 's all retired to sixty seven and I 'm a mental health people men biologically Point Road well I 'm around up area Mondays we do pottery and art Tuesday we do compose as wit mix boys have come out of prison office other the prison and on photos we do a workshop and there 's one thing I want to mention and it was come come from a young non-indigenous for here at the lodge we sit down Fridays with were suddenly out of yarns and ask them about their difficult problems and this young boy said to me I they all respect me dare to call me uncle Bob by our steamer said where was your difficult problems and in prison of that and he mentioned three things and will actually approving the boys one was a fig tree where we were toy to where he said scrub the floor we sold over the same subway step some noise soap which we had to wash our clothes their body wood and scrub our body with that brush which we had to get down on the floor and scrub them did some floor and and polish the floor yes blog well enjoy I 'm sitting down with our boys I shouted in the short film that I just brought our teas I said nothing 's really happening the alcohol doesn 't you know that it may happen to the rest of the boys and the third one he told me about was six or varies we set Appetit I was lucky in that one daughter I was like you 're out so I remember very clearly Evan dance the render came for not time was my nan and pop and my mum and a list of those stories that my uncles that were telling and it seems that they used to draw in the ground and talk about the stars because our family it 's such a beautiful starlight looking things sadly that the skies is not as blue as it was when we were growing up and that 's noticeable everywhere but I call it lucky and the day we made him walk was through that gate it was the Hindu faith that beautiful time of my childhood yeah I I where it is and one of the things that were gonna push forward is that you know that we 've got that educational bus but one of the things in the journey of 1997 that the Royal Commission I think it was about it was second or third recommendation was that the bringing back home was part of the the children they were removed or kidnapped or stolen from their families and communities have the right to be welcome back home so we 've had one uncle it went back home and stayed there Roy great yeah made the song why myself my journey home and then being rejected and back on I 'll go back for another dose when kbh comes with me to go back still I mean we got a lot of skills and that universities and the young people today that 's the beautiful part about it they want to know they they 're sick of the lies the sick of what every big gone out there and we we took a blame on it myself because fear was held and it was in so I tell you they 've got the door shutting me up and here when they give me away in there I 'm getting used to talk to meet up with these hoes so now would he go in there yeah nothing like more says my wife said because she 's sick and generation but she has been you know saw that she 's been you know it 's been seen the area 's right she said to me said you you better get up and tell your story because always the caper coy even you know got to make the recipe if and when I did see me elder sister I went to our Civil War was a reason she kept quiet I even asked mom and dad make what they would talk about and we actually either grandfathering that boys I 'm in the 40s I went to the walls I 've actually got a father in the uniform yep he was a nickel so I said to the family when I pass on I want to be cremated I 'm father my lashes with my dad and talked and of 43 to the medical problems I went some day and one lollipop or the oldest boy Bob to keep the rest early so I want to be back in my country with the ashes so they said there 's a lot of noise being told you can get it out with that mobile of us we got it 's amazing people come and see it and when they look up in their world of names for the boys that we live some of grandfather 's still I think they 've got a camp down there between 29 and 70 something like that 400 to 600 that they 've gone through that thing there and when when when we talk about councils the biggest thing about where we talking here boy she just said that we 're near storytellers the storyteller that 's it 's beautiful and it 's good but the storytellers most important thing of Aylan is the listeners they arrive and so we get to that point to where where we got listeners we can hail and their people can nail the heat and because of the all up in it on the missions where we were the first institutions again this goes back to truth telling them that they need to tell the truth the shows that we have now that they need to understand that there is multicultural before they came and there is multicultural people in town in where we are we got gamba Roy Radley and Wildwood and all of these even in the homes where we was we are our Brotherhood of brothers that go together in the strength of trying to heal their selves as much as we 're trying to set the foundation for the children but the but is I have a spiritual inside of me which is wrong upon people of a nation where we are so they this education needs to go to our service providers that are out there so that they understand that this like myself trauma was just a word but then to get down to bottom to where it is to understand that trauma which was something that was it 's a disease that was eaten away at me and it eats away are day armed and one of them last last year we had a gathering out of their EMU EMU Plains instead of the day when he comes in on the 26th or whatever it is we call it survival day it 's important that they accept the fact that that this wasn 't discovered it was invaded and we we just want the truth to be told so the showers are the ones that make make local law in everywhere where we go and the further you go Western over there Blue Mountains the further they are behind and they live in a fear factor that but no they think we 're going to hand them or take them we don 't we don 't do that we 're not a people that do that and we never was a people to do that what it is is just to acknowledge them we are who we are it 's just a bit of respect you know it does always goes far let 's hope we can say get bigger girl we 're gettin it you [Music] _"

language and my we are the protectors of the black duck and before you the questions come again I will say this that you make me and my brothers ever so proud to be able to do this after so many years of not being able to voice a pain that was carrying and hurting us from inside out I thank yous for this true from my heart Thank You uncle uncle how important is it for people to learn about your stories and The Stolen Generation I use my own children for an example when I talk to answer this question please and my children have grown up in a way that they could not and unable to function in society and in the local community or any community for that reason the reason being is that I never knew how to be a parent when those people took me away from my mother and father that time we didn 't know where my father was but and when we were removed from our parents family we were no longer to have family love was to have a love that was a traumatized love of being told what to do flogged starved abused sexually and there 'd the other way that these people could see so my life became a painful journey and a fearful journey I was frightened to make a decision I didn 't know whether I was right allowed to harks for things so I was frightened I asked for things or frightened let my children go to certain places I would not let anybody babysit him I wouldn 't let him go into the hospitals when my wife called woman come out without my child out of the hospitals I would go in and I tell her to go back and get him she 'd go in bless her and try and come back out sometimes and say they won 't give him give him or her to me so I 'd go in no tell him if you don 't give so that was well says it 's a trauma that I didn 't know about until it had got to the stage would I say this when I got these and I turned 18 nobody was going to tell me what to do again because of what was happening and what had happened to me I couldn 't kill that pain of inside of me so I became the drink I turned the alcohol it would it would make me happy for a while but then somewhere along the line or how many drinks whatever I would black out and I would become I describe yourself we 're not talking about it and sometimes even my own children I describe yourself as a little Tasmanian Devil Carter and yeah the visitors you read a lot that I didn 't want anybody to come near me or them so that 's what I did I many a small man but I I used to get in a lot of fights because what happened to us when we started to talk to the people in their own community you 'd look into and you think what did I say what did I say wrong I never said nothing wrong later on when I 'd run into those people day a week a month later and I 'd be happy mood of having a few beers I 'd tell them I 'd say you didn 't like me you I 'd call him some nasty names but then we 'd get into her yeah so that was a world and then the jails the judges the laws the police the courthouses they took control of my life so a journey of 40 to 50 years of drinking I worked out good worker like all the brothers that come out of that place we we could work I thought hard the problem was we didn 't fit no longer into our communities because we weren 't brave wife brainwash the down call of that I call it reprogramming they reprogram a giant branes when we were little so near that I 'm growing up I couldn 't understand the pain that was in here and disappear so Indy saw this body there was a had a drink for eight years I 've never smoked for eight years it 's lovely the same beautiful faces it goes and things and and I haven 't been locked up for ideas either generational trauma and the impacts they 're still very real it 's still very much happening for our kids and their kids why was the apology so important and the that 's that 's that 's double sorted blade that one and when did I come that he was making the apology my sister who went to Tom we were taken with five and my brother who was four they come around and they asked me if I was going to get in and with him just to it and I said I said no I said it 's not that mean nothing to me but they said to me but you 're Ariel Paulus say you you we need you to come with us so I went I glad I went because when I was down there I met a lot of other people who had this same pain that I was carrying and it lifted up my hope that there would be a change in the lives and hope that our children could be able to be there be free of what was coming up was the alcohol and drugs and things like that and the neglect that they were that we as people of the first people of this land get from a lot of people so it it didn 't didn 't stop what they were doing but what hurts us today and why it 's important that we do this where we talk is that and 2017 I 'll user for an example in 2017 there was seventeen thousand children that were taken from the parents the seven years earlier he said he was sorry so if you 're sorry it means you don 't do this anymore but that 's that 's where that went so at this moment this is the best chance that we have as survivors from the place that we went down to carry this story forward to be able to make changes that 's more positive for our children and grandchildren that 's right these stories and what better than from you fellas you know from our uncles the the people that have been through the situation you know and how do we move forward what can we do to support you and keep this conversation going what you 're doing right now is one of the biggest pluses about what it is come up come up there was 10 years ago with these cameras and we would as we would have said something quite different days yes but it 's it 's it is it 's it 's a positive way and technology even today we know that and I don 't like picking on anybody but when when there is incidents where people get involved with Authority they have a tendency of abusing us more than they should so with technology and photography and mobile phones which are a good thing because that we can record what 's happening on that spot to verify what we were saying or that that they were doing wrong but there 's also flipside of those that too because there 's so many young people that 't know because the world has just sort of get along it doesn 't show the love that used to be that we as a people always ever add as we like the love and share today 's world is to hone and control though it 's it 's a cycle that 's very difficult to to model together that 's right it is very hard you know and what are some of the visions that you see that that we need in the future to thank you for that question it 'll bring me mine to 2017 on the 11th of October when we were guests down at the government house or some male stake in Macquarie Street and they give us a piece of paper that stated that it was the Bill of Rights of language 2017 and 11th of October they give me a piece of paper that told me that I now have the right to hone and speak my language people think that this was all the time but that 's not so only two and a half years ago that this actually happened that change that as we go back and we learn their language it 's going to be hard for me but I break down and cry when I watch and I listen to some of the young people talk in this language and I 've really sit down and she talks a good Miller Roy language and I get a little bit jealous because I can 't talk my name per language but I know that that 's going to be beautiful it 's a thing forward and if the government learns to are going to say this now is not to break family structure by taking children away but to help those families men to be a parent to be able to look after children given the resources all of us the resources to be able to do that by doing that they will mold and mend communities and make communities are more happier place for people to live if they don 't do that keep destroying families you destroy communities the cycle continues doesn 't it all the time yeah so we must and just lastly what is reconciliation 's one of those words that our people will say how come reconcile and where we never consult in the first place and at the truth telling about what happened on this land is the biggest and most important thing that we need to get right that when he sailed up and down this Coast for three days and seen all those fires and then written that it was Turan alius and I 'd say this what did he think that the kangaroos and emus made those fires yeah a little so conciliation would be a better way to try and handle that but as a reconciliation is what of what we do where do we reconcile something that we never had that 's right Thank You uncle beautiful thank you [Music] _"
