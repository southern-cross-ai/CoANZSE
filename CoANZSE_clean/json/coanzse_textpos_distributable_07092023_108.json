    "text": "but perhaps of the area of you 'd like to present on those first and then we 'll have questions and being debate so I just wanted to clarify today that the purpose of this report is twofold so fiercely it 's because this is a statutory process and we need this material and this documentation on council aim to have been debated and that 's why we 've presented on another occasions but secondly the purpose of it is to really narrow down the options that the working party will come back to you on so it 's not to make a definitive decision about a proposal it 's just too narrow narrow down the options in the key s fix it the wooden party is seeking direction on as the treatment of banks peninsula and whether the council is open to considering a increase in number of wards ed councillors so those are the two methods that are really there working parties seeking and Direction form so it 's like in pets take the rest of the reporters rear does it yeah now that 's fine so so on a or b and that 's in relation to the existing banks peninsula Ward being retained and considered to be an isolated community or that the bank 's financial community be combined with other communities to form a ward that compliance with the complies with the definition of fair representation now just just in terms of that I man I 'm of a mind to move number B I mean little bit then the second of the two but there would be I think our support for a community board to still represent that occur or yr ls1 so how does how do you formulate that or does that have to be included as a part of the recommendation no no so when when the next report comes back council with the options it will actually have identified community boards and and it can come with an option that has a division before I cut our way right so because I mean I wouldn 't want to be seen to be moving or supporting a recommendation that didn 't have they 're so so yeah so maybe maybe if 's furniture community be combined with other communities to form a ward that compliance with the definition of fair representation under Section 92 of the local literal act 2001 preserving however the option of the akaroa flesh wiry were community board you 've been treated as an isolated being Teresa later being treated as an isolated community yeah great got a seconder for that Yanni yep okay now does anyone want to ask questions about that or do you want to fill thank you because I mean ways I think some questions around the whole to not just there to the part of it no no we 're dealing like part by part so we 'll deal with the second issue which is the numbers next but we 'll just deal with the okay I have got a question around it it 's that it 's really if if in fact we support me that it be combined with other communities just wondering if you can tell me what be in the impact on the other Ward 's as it may be and for example how might the change in new ward that communities of interest might also be crossed yes so the impact on other Ward 's will depend on the number of or two heads so on with the current number of wards banks peninsula would need to come right across the hills so it would need to come right across the hills either side and right now from halls will be small and craycroft Kashmir heathkit we cliffs Amla so it would take it would it would become quite a large Ward to get them to get the right ratios with the current Ward number depending on your if you had other ward numbers it would get smaller so so that would depend on the ward size so the wooden party could come back with some varying options around that when they get to mething status thanks me because my understanding is that the shape of any new ward also has to take into account those local communities and you mentioned some of them specifically yep so any any structure that the council has under this representation with you will have to combine communities of interest so community so far has been quite small and any structure has to combine those but the key to key way of doing this is to look at looking for ways that they can be combined and still retained within one word or one community board and other ways you can do that is by having divisions within your community board structure so within a community board structure instead of having every community board member elected at-large you would have divisions so you would have for this community board for example you may have to community board members elected from that division to that division to the net division a bit like I could ryo data does at the moment in out of that sort of compilation to is you you we wouldn 't be able when the Commission wouldn 't want to split any communities of interest between two different wards that 's what they would be looking to ensure that wither council had done it if they get too if it gets to an appeal which they generally do but I think that that 's something that you would they 've been back to you is to make sure that communities are not split strawberries are not split David the last couple of elections we have what do you think the local government Commission response would be to an ongoing situation there my take is that the sort of allowed above I think there 's an expectation that we as a city will have to address situation the last earth Commission 's findings they were relatively clear that they expected the council to revisit all their community awards and particularly to to revisit the bank 's financial because they were I think there 's a quote in here the state from the Commission filings that they said it would be hard to justify bakes flinches to continue as an isolated community particular that Littleton basin so they had fled to council there they expected not only a close look at banks plancher but also a close look at all the other wards and as it turned out the council just have to look at them because the numbers post-earthquake of really skewed across all wards that that effectively sort have to go yep yani as chair of the week and pilots want to bring your attention to page 237 which has a table of wood that currently have an exception to that rule now interesting to note that thanks an answer sets at seventy percent deviation south-south stuff and districts to thailand has eighty-three percent so that 's probably I mean dead as the greatest deviation in New Zealand but I think everyone can understand waste your Island could make the case then the next highest apart from being Spencer would be golden bay and so some of the community that was well use the Golden Bay arguments but even if you still do that you still end up significantly deviating from from that phone which is why I think it would be incredibly hard to justify it in front of the local government commission but it 's not to say as we go through the options in terms of the ratios that we might get a smaller deviation than then this current seventy percent but yes I just wanted to I think that table is really useful to of the local government Commission around the need for an isolated community for that entire entire yep our felt I guess just one luck sort of obvious but not so obvious point because in some ways it 's removed from us but mine is daniel would hate that even though for example especially because banks peninsula will be incorporated into other wards that in fact the people in that area will still want to ensure that they have sufficient representation that 's fair and we 've made reference to the committee boards but is that that 's what I 'm checking as is that something that the people of banks panocha are likely to want ever say oh listen maybe Andrew would like to comment on me madam chair yeah when I was intending making some comments in the debate and I can I can do that now if that 's appropriate or at knew that at the appropriate time do you need Andrew to respond to that before we debate it I 'm happy either way I think that that isn 't because we 're voting on this that of banks peninsula andrew is the local ward councillor but it 's important for us i think to understand it and making this decision so I don 't mind either way I 'm happy to wait all right and Lisa Mirabal so do what I so teeny may walk calmly because she was responsible for a large proportion of the consultation but my understand was Biggs peninsula I was was favoring initially being an isolated community but actually realized that if that was not possible they wanted to be retained as a big speech community and coming to another ward so Sienna 's rock okay so that they would just change the wording on advice that because isolated community is a phrase that only goes with wards so preserving however the option of the ark royal warrior community board being retained as a separate identity entity so yeah so that 's the it means that the option because I mean I 'm hearing the word option so we can 't actually make the decision here and now without advice so all right so I 'll open it up for debate this and I 've been I guess part of the the journey of the engagement that we 've had with the public I 've attended I think four different meetings on the peninsula and it 's fair to say that the people of the peninsula pretty much started out with a view that the peninsula should be retained as is that the current arrangements should remain as they are and that the argument should be put that it was a community an isolated community as the level of understanding is increased and as time has gone on I think there 's a greater understanding that the peninsula numbers-wise is totally out of whack with where we would expect it to be and we we need to be mindful of the comments that the previous commissioners had made and the likely expectations this time around I mean I 'm certainly not saying that there isn 't a view on the peninsula that the peninsula should remain isolated there are certainly some communities and some people on the peninsula do feel that and do feel that quite strongly however I think it of how the peninsula fits within the city and how the the numbers can be dealt with I do think the a Corot why rework community board been maintained as the status quo is certainly one way of dealing with the isolated community aspects of baccarat and the outer bogeys in fact the the area beyond Gabi 's pass has been isolated from the rest of the city and I certainly welcome that and would continue to support it the fear on the peninsula is that the peninsula would be drowned out by a large number of urban people that would form part of the same ward and I think as long as that 's addressed the people of the peninsula and certainly the community board chairs and the community board members would support an extended Peninsula ward one of the things that we have seen particular resistance to has been a concept of splitting the peninsula so there was originally some conversation around the lyttelton harbour part of the peninsula would amalgamate with other areas of the port hills and they occur oh my rear part of the peninsula the peninsula would be split and that certainly was one of the things that we 've heard time and time again both in meetings and anecdotally wouldn 't be supported by the people of the peninsula who do see themselves as one community of interest and there 's been particular support from the for ruining on the peninsula to keep the peninsula together as well as that respects the borders of those ruining areas so it 's for those reasons that I 'm happy to to move from I think perhaps a position that I would previously have held that the peninsula should be seen as an isolated community my view has changed over time and I think it 's fair to say that the view of a majority of the community including the community board chairs and community board members as has changed over time as well but I think it 's important that we respect that the peninsula is a community of interest which the fear really is that it 's not drowned out by a large urban community in any arrangement and appreciating that some of that can be cheap through other mechanisms as well so yet certainly happy in that context to support option B FL and I 'll also support option B and I think though its input and like clearly it needs to change in terms of the Commission 's own earlier decisions and also that you know it doesn 't meet the relation to it holds by mile as Adam regret of the chart chart that vianney referred to but I think it 's important for us to learn and keep in mind around this hot in making the further decisions today what we learn from the way banks peninsula has a actually operated as a ward and how the community boards have really assisted that so well I think it 's a really good example of a smaller community actually thriving in terms of getting things done in terms of local governments and I pay tribute to that the board cheers involved into the counselor and counselor previous councils who represented their ward but it is an example to me we 're a small community does work really well in terms of into and when we eventually decide on the future boundaries for their ward so we make sure that in fact it 's lined up in terms of similar communities of interest and although some geographic features breath yeah and thank you I 'm certainly a favor of option B but I just want to add something else too I me not to the thing about to the conversation is that for me a lot of this stuff is about the community boards and the delegations and I think if we get the delegations right and actually shift all the power to community boards yep to deal with stuff in their communities then actually this stuff doesn 't become such a big deal you know I think counselor should be dealing with metropolitan issues we have stuff come up at council meetings all the time which actually I don 't need to know about even the Brighton stock today let them sort it out it 's stuff in their community their community assets they can manage them sort them out so I think as long as you 've got the acura with stuff area then actually I don 't think it 's such a problem to be part of a big award so for that reason I 'm supportive of that Thank You Jamie I 'll be brief work with this I 've actually changed my view on this this first issue when I when I read the report and we threw it I actually felt that Bank splinter was an isolated community purely because there 's actually an isolated community you drive through another council you there so I think though what ref was talking about in the delegations I think really struck a chord with me and in this instance I think it 's actually putting this totally into practice in taking the guidance from the people with that knowledge and Andrew himself is supporting be and no one 's been an hour better than hunting so I so I I 'll change my view on that and if that can work with nine out those issues but but I do think that um the real key is is with the delegations resting with the community there and I of the most significant changes that we could be making so I 'll roll with them with beyond this associate and our pool but a holiday be is my pick of the recommendations and I think it 's really more about seeing crisis as a whole and we shouldn 't have isolated community of arrow home where we can either and being effective so I 'll take on board actually council clear waters point about the fact that they have been representing really really well even though they are geographically isolated I think as a city we are actually looking after our fringes exceptionally well so we also get to this view that the way we make our decisions we are Christchurch crisis goes right through Decker are part of it does go through another council that sister waiters but I think we just need to be seen as looking at our city as a whole rather than less you whole lots of isolated communities very good all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's Carrot thank you right comment which years is just on the delegations just to give you the heads-up that the workshop around bored community delegations as prior to you having to determine your final proposal yeah so the timing will work out yes yeah but i think i think refs comments particularly relevant to the second resolution now which one do you want to you want to move d all right that 's yeah um yeah okay well i mean it clearly that there 's going to be a different different view and I around this one so I 'm just okay um process it 's chair of the weekend party I mean normally chair that we can party would move the recommendations and on happy happy to to move to eat perhaps it 's good to vote on that and then see what happens and then come back to the other one which is if these not carried I don 't_''_1232.77 I don 't really see how else you can do it with those those two no that 's true you can 't_''_1237.46 you can 't really that there are and I are discussion first because I think that there are a number of questions that that that I certainly want to pose I mean I I don 't favor this option at all and in many respects it 's it 's for a number of the reasons that that ref mentioned before but but I 'll get when once I want to get some questions out first so it seemed to me when I read the report that a number of people were concerned about making a call on the number of councillors before they knew what the budget and pet would be now in the olden days and actually not that long ago the remuneration authority used to have a what he called it a pool so all of the counselors and all the community board members were paid for from a pool and once that pool was was was established you you couldn 't you couldn 't get any more so if the number of councillors reduced dramatically like they did in 2004 was it then the amount per counselor was paid almost doubled overnight and so the way that concerned now that that if they said they wanted more counselors than it was going to cost a lot more money and so could you give us some advice here at the table how much more does each council a cost if we did introduce a system that resulted in more counselors look I would be like let 's feel as Christians think we should but I want to make the point and it 's a figure to like a point of order that if we 're going to raise other Christians that sip away from the recommendations and what 's in the report we can ask them however a whole lot of other questions could be asked in relation to representation like for example the cost of community boards and that kind of thing so oh hang on my question is an order my question is in order understand a number of people said in the report that would you like me to quote I think the main I think the main thing of the clarification about is that in fact we are asking questions but I didn 't extra so if we have one extra two extra and and how many extra as does this one to 16 ratio produce I think it 's 19 counselors so how much does that cost over and above what we get now so we have sought our concrete advice from the renumeration Authority and they haven 't provided that yet about because what they 've said is that it 's no longer a pool of money and that it is based on job sizing so we we 've gone back to them and ask them for advice about what would be the difference hypothetically if the council weaned from 10 to 20 and we 're seeking that advice from them at the moment so but we said we needed this today we did we did that 's right but Darrell 's been dreamed in two or three times a day for the last week and has a godless contents that 's so there is a memo that came around to counseling on the twentieth of februari that address this very coin and the key thing to note from that memo is set using a formula reflects job sighs hours of work and uses a formula involving population and expenditure to reach it further so in very simple terms it will go like to a job sizing phone so presumably if you had least responsibilities least population who warned you would have least no no we 're not we 're not interested in that we 're interested in the amount because individuals have raised it during the process and we sit on Monday we needed the information today because we were having this very debate yes but unfortunately the Carter does not sit remuneration for elected members I 'm not a rational thority does so I mean I don 't want to raise a point of order but it is something that 's outside our control and if a blip want to know before they make a decision and I want to know what the result is I 'm not in favor of this one of of having 19 councillors sitting around the table if I don 't know how much more that is going to cost the city of christchurch right way we wish to go forward today through these preferences then report will be compiled with the various options which will show you what that expenditure could be but recognizing that remuneration is the subject of the remuneration authority and I mean I 've I 've been here long enough to know that there is no certainty through that authority as to what we will be paid when the community board members had their sizes doubled so in the numbers cut they got a reduction in pay but yet councillors got a huge increase because they used to be in Paul and that and that year they were in a pool they 're not in a pool now and I don 't think it 's unreasonable for the public of Christchurch to know how much extra per council it would be but okay well it 's clear that we have insomnia so it definitely sort it so but it will be an extra card whiter it could be it could be an extra cost but we don 't know how much extra cost that will be so that 's why wasn 't at all today legally that 's not a consideration in terms of the representation yeah so I mean it 's important information and we need to be aware of it but in terms of the process that we 're going through it is not a consideration it is not legally part of the consideration of as as we need to go through identifying communities of interest determining if you know we 've been asked one question today consider fairness of representation of a weakness no we 've been asked whether we want to retain the current member population ratio of approximately 12 26 or propose a member population ratio closer to the Metro New Zealand city average of 12 16 and a half thousand could it matter to you through you could I just say that there is possibly a roller badly worded recommendation yeah and it should have been more does the council want to retain the existing ratio or would it consider alternative ratios and so then when the options come back to council they come back with some other options of current more you know as cut and dry and I apologized well I 'm I 'm a little concerned because the the way the ratio I mean when I heard that the ratio being proposed was was the was the New Zealand average I was actually surprised to find out that actually it 's not the New Zealand of the sorry the metro average when I noticed there Auckland is one to 70,000 and that 's what I mean it 's really the small metro yeah but Auckland is massive it 's a different legislation can I just say we probably need some more information about Oakland because they 're under a different legislation I understand and in fact they have local boards what my question really toe then is if since we 're obtaining information about the costs of an additional council although there might be hard to Rican can we also get some estimate of the costs of strengthening up strengthening community boards for example if they would have more resources and bases and that kind of thing because in a way that someone don 't even their own sort of meeting like as well wait that Quebec only up and the various options rather then that 's nice if it comes making the options on I 'm fine without you thank you thing that I mean I I really I 'm really strongly of the view but I mean I 'm completely biased because I say this is the mirror is that I want an equal number of of of wards because if you don 't have an equal number of more an equal number of councillors then the the mirrors just I mean doesn 't have essentially a vote that can be a deadlock break we can change the Standing Orders there be a casting vote and I have no problem with that but in all honesty you are the mere so why do you do it okay himself in Troy to simply say to me here 's a casting vote means that there 's no no deadlocks I have no cries then you don 't that 's right might be indeed I might do that I hadn 't thought of it has changed the up standing orders yeah sorry a lot of questions you know on this but anyway but you need to have a decision on us today not not assume just a steer whether you whether because what the weekend parties asking for was banks punch was a most important yeah we 've done there yep and yep done it so the second one was just a steer from for us to create options from so a steer that you would like options or of the existing of of more of more so you could you could ask for you don 't need to make a decision or not least give us a steer not these oh well you could say is okay I 'm just worried that the resolution screen change without consent of them I haven 't_''_1855.789 touched it I know you got just what we 're looking at well we hang on but there 's lots of people who want to ask questions so let 's get all the questions on the table and let 's see if we can move this along because if we can 't move this along today then you and and you may have to just revisit this but anyway it 's Jimmy you okay I 'm sorry I mustard I mustard it was a mistake so we 'll go Pauline then Jimmy then turn then Jamie then Andrew oh god thanks Leah and I 'm sorry that you missed me um my question is from my clarification at d if d was passed would that actually preclude an option to carry on with the status quo which which is C so if we cast d we could still end up with see eventually that 's my question and I like is the preference of council as you 're not making a firm decision you 're giving a preference to guide the weekend party but the weekend party might come back but the mover and seconder heaven accepted the wording change so no no the existing one the existing recommendation is the report recommended is it with its preference as to so that 's existing we human nation as give it just giving it the education of its preference it 's not a firm decision it 's an indication it 's just a preference and the stage they 'll still come back what 's the big deal come back with options again so Jimmy a one question because if we review it 2.7 on page 216 particular here emphasize sir we did have the preliminary consultation from 3,000 residents consulted and seeking the first a tool for a point the lumber counselors the be increase the size of woods the decrease however they still no quantified is only the and in principle so regarding to the longboarder popular you mention earlier is is painter is a kind of a flexible one is you consider Eva currently one ratio one to twenty six thousand won the alwans more face for now only one is a current age of 12 16 maybe when to the 1801 to 2000 say so because if he are not quantify three paper and not one is regarding canceled amber as they 're concerned is also my question while is a function and currently will partake of a council meeting committee meeting subcommittee meeting task force working a group and council a moment still based on have so many the meeting will be you know for this my questions you know this uncertainty whether we need to have a whole package to make this an ample concert is my pleasure just asking for preference yeah yeah yeah so there will be we 're asking for preferences because the weekend party was making a multitude of scenarios and getting nowhere so this was giving some preferences and the options will come back and they will be quite detailed they will be this is the option the advantages and disadvantages of each option will wait up any financial implications of each option this is really just trying to narrow the options from here to here here yeah because we can 't have a whole you know sort of retirement don 't know honey yeah that 's right sub crazy but if you have a bagel you verse 33 the options either give they give us a date on whether the point number you blam burner tranquila counselor whether you have only two comunico member to make an analogy it 's not just it 's not a critical now of us asking as the gate and increase that 's all it 's doing it 's not doing anything else if we were going to say wanted to say those question of them but yeah but I mean we 've been going around in circles it was a question of money let 's get rid of six councillors and go close to Auckland treasure so that 's just 0 absence of it yeah that 's that 's Oh gob be happy to accept that as an amendment Jamie there was more of a statement but i just thought Darrell 's memo that came out on Thursday was quite clear about the remuneration so I didn 't have a really a question around their eyesight just want to read away right kind of what you said is that the remuneration authority doesn 't do it on how many councillors you 've got it 's done on the population city in the work type if you had sex more counts as it doesn 't mean that people start having the amount of counselors that are reply to all goes to or an you have sex men councils it 's going to cost about six hundred thousand dollars more it 's not true it 's not commit a job sizing occurs and maybe we can get strategic pray in and explain it to you the thing you want to bring strategic may and to explain you know I just anyway my it will wait for the advice for wait for the advice Glen yes I just wanted to check that the primary considerations here are the local electoral act and including Guard Alaska by the local government Commission when it gets to that to them and so there are quite clear steps that the council needs to follow and we and it has to be quite a robust process and it needs that 's why we have followed this process and reiterated out step by step and done each step it 's fair to say that your response to our submission will come back on on how well with absolute on our ability to the crease those Italy right so when when its appeal to them as it probably will be as our look at all thank you fell um I just want to ask you about the pre engagement because my understanding is that someone the report your interview or a few genera people gave feedback something like over 3,000 or extraordinary and the question is really on page 225 there 's an outline of the process fear that around the consultation and I 'm just and how you know that was done I 'm just one and also the results of their to the majority of feedback supported a lower ratio of population councils what I 'm wondering is in terms of the processes does that that information about how that pre-engagement was done and who you will went to and then numbers involved does does that go to the Commission where has it gone to Commission and also then especially would they with the commission also take the feedback from that and pre-engagement into account yes everything has to go through commercial so we are already bundling up every single solution that we got back if you select we got back every single notes of community because everything goes the advised by the Commission they advise the process to use and we used it and they have been monitoring engaging with us if we step of the way and are quite supportive of the process used to date from here it has another engagement another consultative formal consultation process so if since the Commission are taking all that into account can I assume that it would probably be unwise of us as a council to to not take all of that into a counter we should be taking it the results of the pre engagement and also understanding the processes and the work that was done we should take into account it will definitely have to be when you come to consider your options you will definitely have to consider what the community feedback was right yep I think that answers it thank you were there other questions that ya ali david andrew and apologies for later this afternoon I just following all from what phil has what I 'm really interested in similar to some of the other issues we 're dealing with often we will hear something from to understand and you have to take into consideration however it may be that that has been stated for brief and months not suggesting that people do and what we do or what have you but it may be that those car from a purely ideological position or a non factual position or whatever a gut feel your answer to fill just then how much reality take into consideration with something like this when if you followed what you were hearing only in the feedback you may be in that create unworkable so I 'm just to answer that in two parts as one citation was not based usually on one conversation so Jenny ran a process where people put forward an idea and then should go back to them with so this idea means a map and a ratio like this is this really what you wanted and then we visited and we looked at so it was actually a giraffe process for those things the other thing is you 'll see from the report is that a number of other factors other than the consultation have been taken area of communities of interest there 's been a whole lot of factors that have been taken and they are listed on 4.7 of all the other factors that have been taken into account to identify communities interest along with the consultation and again they are things that you will have to consider when you determine your options and there will be our line made with regards to going back and you know Federation 's our suggestion if the idea has come from a place that doesn 't stack up in the first place as far as say workload or whatever that iteration isn 't necessarily going to address that if you 're doing it based on ratios of population and ward max is it so what I 'm saying is if someone comes with an idea it has then explored and there 's another iteration or it 's developed into a method geographical interpretation of what someone is asking for issues around how award works what a workload is what the major pieces of work that counselors have to do in community boards that isn 't necessarily going to showing owning it very well and the communities an engineer in her team and that some people said I 'll no actually that 's not what I wanted actually but first proposal when I theoretically said it when I see it on a mat or I way up covered to our way out what you isn 't and that was adapted this may suggest Iran boundary so Mary would that be someone actually looking at the cool nature of what they were expecting and their their consultation with you not about what someone or a counselor or community would actually has to do Asian or debate and each group where we weep back we tried to factor all of that in and all of those things came up in every conversation people got really in deep but I mean this is not a really strict science and what we did was not a total academically tested process because some people said to us we 'll look I don 't know for example what should happen about the exponential ax why don 't we let the people on banks peninsula decide ratios because why don 't you go and ask the counselors so I mean because the counselors know what their workload is other people said I don 't know a counselor if you got a smaller number of councillors per population I would like to know counselors quite a lot of people seem that so there 's just so many factors involved in this and when we come to your final decision making we will have to take all these factors that the local government Commission wants into consideration and give your show to the Commission your answers as to why you wait for your initial option and then your final option so there 's plenty more chances to debate all this as we go along and I mean you are the final decision makers to get before the Commission now your final one that I don 't want it no wait wait wait I 've got a speaking order but I just I don 't want anyone to think for a minute that we are at all unhappy with the process I mean I think every one of us that they have been out there and pre engaged with our communities about what is often a controversial issue so you know and yannis been leading the the working group on behalf of elected members I think that he 's done a sterling job in that regard but there is going to be a waiting govern to her and that was just a perfect description of how some people what they want isn 't exactly how they 're expressing they what they want it delivered so and and that will be subject to a lot of interpretation I 've got a couple of questions around that myself but I 've got David and then Andrew and then reef thank you look I see this issue with being police ended around banks peninsula because of the huge differential and their ratio currently civil one hour thousand it 's a bit of a numbers game and that if we had had now have now with an equal population there be something close to fifty one thousand and each Ward which means we 've got we would have to share 42,000 people into across the city if we created another ward we would have an average of forty four thousand dot would and we 'd have to shoot 36,000 into the bank 's financial award my bows really centers around a scenario of going to the Electoral Commission and saying we have have an odd situation here with banks peninsula what ratio of population to council would be an acceptable ratios for call that Commission and I and I mean maybe we end up with a sort of a one to twenty two or three for the city and banks peninsula might be at one to twelve thousand whether that 's acceptable or not to the Commission I don 't know but we interface with a prospect of finding a small addition to banks peninsula which becomes palatable to the Electoral Commission or we have a large chunk of the city added to exponential to make it equitable so for me this there 's a couple of balls in the air I think there may be a case to say well we do have a community of some exception can we accept a banks peninsula we 've only destroying stretch of a question though but literally I mean no no we 've already decided that where there is a percentage that you can that you unders Andover 's yeah plus or minus what is it is but what I 'm saying is do we need to talk to the commissioner I know oh yeah yeah we are now in a position where it has to be plus or minus ten percent ever seen you ever what I 'm saying can we actually put a case forward for the banks peninsula a tea for that you can 't go outside I know the pot the storm the plus or minus ten percent but the population base to be lower no no no you know no the point is is that it can only be plus or minus TM Bhasin your bubble but that 's assuming like a good good you hear number and the whole city I personally think that we have dealt with it and the first question we asked so Ginny _"

's on any of those that can 't participate on this I 'm not conflicted so I 'll move the recommendation seconded by Phil Clearwater is any discussion I put the motion did you want sorry too late it was just slightly that on the one just before the half year reports no idea to say okay how about an agent I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no offline if if you want to follow up on something yeah and we have the recommendation on the statements of intent there were some changes that we recommended that we adopted so that we the committee recommendation actually added yet that 's right the adopting of the staff recommendation with amendments in relation to the crush each agency for energy trust and the rod Donald banks lunch and the base so I shall move that and seconded by David you 're not conflicted on any of these no I shall you know you 're not oh no sorry no that 's fine yep okay i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried a report of the greater christchurch urban development strategy implementation committee I 'll move the staff recommendation do I have a seconder for that our Paul lonsdale Yanni can I just ask that we have a workshop on the urban development strategy I know that we did get invited to 18 philly short notice last week and of course it wouldn 't have been big enough but I a council that we do get a bit of a briefing on the urban development strategy and IM concerned some of the things in this terms of reference giving a mandate to to this panel to make submissions feedback that will all mandate from us as a collective council to our representatives so I appreciate that we want to make changes to this and I guess we can put those changes forward but can I also ask that we can get a workshop for us as a council to talk through how the urban development strategies going yep I 'm very happy for there to be a workshop I think that I 'm the utes I see has an independent chair so i will have a talk to him because i think it would be important to get him to come down and perhaps cheer that workshop and then we have a staff member who i can spot at the end of the room there I don 't know Keith do you want to come up to the table and talk about because there was a workshop but it did but perhaps if you 'd like to give us just a brief overview of holding a workshop and what that might entail I know that these amendments are to take over the functions of the recovery strategy Advisory Committee which no longer really has a purpose and but but i think that yannis raised a good point about really informing councillors of how the whole process works and yes I rather go into the detail of the UDS right now i 'll be happy to speak with the independent chair arrange a suitable time and go from there and really there 's kind of two elements to that there 's one just looking back see how things came to be and some of their useful lessons that we can learn from and then at some point in future looking forward and that 's wrapped up with a lot of the current transition discussions yeah and I 'll be quite keen to advance that and I 'm just actually wondering whether we should you know make it a workshop and an open meeting you know like this as the previous one committee to the utes IC is because the utes I see is a as a creature of local government it 's a joint committee and it means that as a public process whereas the recovery strategy advisory committee hasn 't been a public process so I 'm actually I 'm actually thinking that this is providing much more how would I describe a transparency and accountability then the recovery strategy advisory committee process but I think nany makes a good point about how we report back now that we 've moved it from one to the other how do we then make it more inclusive of other councillors as we only have three representatives through council I 'm just kind of wait and make one point before you consider the matter the because it 's a joint committee the three other council Environment Canterbury why my career in soin have been considering this matter also they 've had their meetings and ratified the terms of reference yeah so if there are things you 'd like to change within the terms of reference that would be difficult to do we 'd other councils to do so but the report does say that I think this is part of an ongoing process yeah so be very welcome to take those other thoughts into sort of a further round of discussion but obviously that 's a matter for you too well i mean i 'm i 'm in favor of accepting the recommendations have been recommended through to us I mean but I don 't get to make the decision the council does but I think that as part of the as part of the workshop that we hold I would like us to also focus very much on the future because we had the UDS and I think greater Christchurch has been well served by the fact that the council 's came together in a cooperative way to develop some thinking around land use over a period of time it was incredibly helpful for the central government to be able to develop the land use recovery planner I don 't personally think that the that the count the government could have worked so quickly to bring together the land use recovery program personally see the co-operative model between the different parties that make up the greater Christchurch UDS I see a UDS area I actually think that that that could be a very good model for providing for future development in the region and that requires us to refresh and to potentially reflect on where we 've got to and then refresh for the future and I 'm very much in favor of doing that so Phil Aaron great that is so that the previous eras AC commit committees functions are transferred up and a figure included incorporated because we 're still obviously under the sea react but i always suggest and so I support the check the young the changes the amendment and I just going to clarify though I 'll just wonder Keith if it might be useful when we have that workshop if some of the Elector members from our from the other two local authorities if they might also be invited to come and then that would give it all councillors a bit of a flavor of how it also also works across the region I don 't that would work for them or us I 'd be very happy for that to happen so all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you key _"

    "text": "now look it was a double thumbs up Yeah right I 'm very keen to be part of the discussion around the representation review and I think if I 'm going to have to trade one over the other then it will have to be the other so so can we move to the representation review I mean the other the other option is that i will any bubbles that we 'll see how this one goes this may take a lot longer than I think everybody 's voting in favor the South fragment well i don 't know i mean if the South brushing one 's going to take as long as the other one then everybody phone with the South recommend all right well let 's do deal with the South brush and one then can you do it in two minutes can we do it reasonably quickly because it there is just there is one thing that I kind of want to put on the table with respect to this one and that is is that there is the stage three notifications that are coming up with we 've referred the draft chapters to the to the ministers for comments and they are due back with us in June I think so by the end of june will be making a public notification of stage three of the of the natural hazards sorry the second part of the natural hazards chapter and that includes coastal erosion and coastal inundation now this area is also already covered and in the stage one notification that 's already public in terms of flood flood risk so i think it will be really important in terms of conducting an expression of interest process for the develop and operation of a motor camp that that takes place after the after the public notification of the this is why this is not in the same time frame as the other one which is what I 'm saying but this notification take place after the notification of the of the what does he call it the second stage of the natural hazards chapter all right in the district plan review so I kind of would like to say conduction expression of interest process blah does say provider information it has in the public domain on the predicted vulnerability of the lens natural hazards but I want that 's why I want this to be it says in the public domain I want that to be after the chapters notified because otherwise it 's not in the public domain and it just seemed to me that that was one little shortfall and the way that the paper was presented but I also wanted to authorized officers to conduct discussions with the existing lease ease in the meantime because it may be that with the relevant information that they will not instruct authorised officers to conduct preliminary discussions with the existing lease ease because there is a lot of community support for the fact that they have been on a month-by-month contract for the last you know well while since the earthquakes and there is a lot of support for them and a lot of the people don 't understand why we have to go out to an expression of interest I understand our procurement policies and processes and I think it 's important that we _''_269.35 't want the community to feel that we 're not disinterested and establishing ongoing extended relationship with the existing lease ease and if we can take legal advice in the meantime that allows us to have that happen it just gives a window of opportunity because we 're not publicly notifying the natural hazards checked or the remainder of the natural hazards chapter until June it just means that there is time for preliminary discussions and a few were to come back if you if you found that there was a solution that fitted within our ability to to set aside the standard process because of the you know nature of the relationship and the negotiations and the discussions then I would want you to know that you could come back to Council with a recommendation that didn 't include the expression of interest but does it make sense yeah you don 't agree with that but no okay so does someone quite happy to move there and the gleam and David so that 's those two yani with respect to the fact that because of our procurement policy I say like the Botanic Gardens cafe so if you 've got my understanding from our policy through the Auditor General 's procurement guidelines for local bodies is that if there 's a compelling reason as to why you would could enter into a negotiation with an existing operator then you have special circumstances that you can take into account and you can do that so you know I just I wasn 't_''_383.65 I just want to recheck on that procurement advice because it does seem to me inherently here but but you know maybe we just have to do it but I personally would like to just negotiate with you operator I agree with you so which is why I 've added on 5.3 and if we could just take the apostrophe out and say authorized to conduct preliminary discussions with the existing lease ease and report back to council prior to conducting the expression of interest with with legal advice as to whether an arrangement can be entered into it 's alright and just a second question I heard was um and to what theme and let them when one evolution block that 's really badly damaged and will cost a lot to folks and should just be demolished totally understand that the other one which is a really simple structure with a lightweight Rove seems I could be very easily fixed cost effectively when you look at the money that we so as part of this coming back is it possible to get some understanding around just the the cost of the repair because I 'm just not convinced that the cost we have are realistic I think that they 're over that they 're just far too much for what is a very simple structure and I think that is part of the consideration in terms of getting it hope they 'll bit there is a question around Kosta Council though look I met with these people before the before I was elected they the only thing that 's stopping them from investing in the site themselves is the fact that they haven 't got any security of tenure and I just think that if there 's some discussions there might be a solution that isn 't do a whole lot of extra work they may come up with a solution that is cost-effective as well so I just want to kind of leave their open for the discussions well yeah okay oh okay it isn 't I look I 'm going to defer this because I I mean I did sort of kind of say this but oh no maybe I 'll just be late for the lunch I 've just got to I 've got a working lunch that starts at twelve no I can 't_''_542.24 so he asked you questions yeah um so two point nine point three seems to me a little bit vague add value for the immediate area and local community is that when compared to the status quo with the camping ground running at the moment or is that compared with the camping ground been closed because bearing in mind that there are things here that our objectives that we 'd want to be met by the eoi it probably would be good to have that specified things like keeping the tennis courts open keeping the paddling pool open generally area complements the reserve next to it okay they will be specified counselor that 's great and in 3.1 there is tree damage in a number of hedge rows of dying yes is that as a result of sea water salts or inundation or is it for some other reason we we strongly believe and their professional advice we 've received a saltwater inundation okay thank you and just one final question three point nine point three ideas for similar uses will be considered at the discretion of the council yeah what 's the process for that does that mean that when the eoi scum in staff would then have a question as to whether they consider those other activities and council makes a decision as to whether they will be considered by staff is that the process the yard that really covers the are it gives the process a little bit more flexibility if a party comes back saying look the there 's a motor camp here and we would also like to be part of a cycle route the not strictly there but it just gives a bit that 's that adds value and we like that but it 'll be counseled makes the decision whether they wish to consider it or ultimately wish though whether they wish to approve it okay thank you thank you yep all right so debate yani ya think he um I just want to thank counselors Livingston Easter arranging the tour of the facility it was it was really eye-opening going out and looking at the site this is providing housing at a time that we have a housing crisis there were people there that I met that are that we 're friends of a friend who were displaced because it is quick repairs and this was the muff place for them to go this is filling a hugely important need at out at our chronic housing situation that we have in the city and I think it 's really interesting that none of those housing values have really been expressed to this process so I urge through the expressions of interest and through the further work they 're actually the importance of providing temporary housing for people at the moment is particularly when you consider the huge amounts of money that we 've been speaking to try and find some of these housing solutions this is actually a very effective efficient cost-effective housing solution for temporary housing there a number of people here that are simply because of the earthquake and we know what the rental markets like in Christchurch we know how chronic it is the lack of affordable rental housing so I think this is really important that we keep open and do everything we can to work through a process to recognize the huge value that it has for our local community and for actually our city the other point is that i know this sea level rise and the climate change issues are real i know that they are happening you can see firsthand elements of that but this isn 't like this is a lightweight motor camp this is you know this is something that can be moved I would have thought at pretty short notice given a few years so we 're talking about a 50 year to a hundred year horizon for sea level is a facility that we shouldn 't be too worried about in the next no five to 10 to 15 to 20 years but of course we should be thinking about it their impact long-term but I would hate for us to the space people 's housing and also further tourism this motor camp so I applaud us for trying to find a solution and I 'm happy to support their amendments that have been put up I 'm Glenn I would like to thank you for placing this on the agenda along with that sincerely the last item obviously or clearly supported the residents are looking for certainty in an uncertain environment and at the moment they 're picking up ambiguous signals so they 're seeing another public asset further up the road confirmed by way of the South New Brighton school then they 're receiving a different kind of signal from the local council they are aware of the realities of sea level rise as a minion that in the wider community and I think there been some good for in our community giving to engage people over think they 've been well received they are aware of that and obviously we must stay aware of those and we will through the district plan process as the mayor has said but as yannis also touched on we 've got to stay aware of other realities which are largely social including a housing shortage in the city social stress in the area and as I said at the start a need for certainty in an uncertain environment I 'm happy with the eoi process I 've got to stick with a policy to promote it and also i 'm required as a counselor to have an open mind and so if there is a legal opinion that comes back and says something different will I oh yes good David thank you look I totally support this brief I think there 's been a lot of concern around the natural hazards chapter and other environmental forecasts shall we say but I think we 've got to be realistic and say even if we agree with the worst of climate change productions we 're looking 30 to 40 years down the rise so that is the life of most buildings and facility so I think that we could proceed the number of years to continue with this facility and I 'm very keen to see this process go through thank you excellent fell look I 'll be brief I support the process to I 'm particularly encouraged with the insertion of the requirement that in fact this what the expressions of interest would depend on the timing the notification other of the risk the natural hazards chapter it is just so important for us and everyone to take into account and that in mind I 'm happy disapproval example alright so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's opposed to note that 's carried thank you thank you John now look I 'm going _"

    "text": "of a clock so I 'm just wondering and I 'm very mindful of the fact that we have an audience clearly here for a particular item on the agenda so I wonder if we might just deal with that item on the agenda first I 'm just guessing it 's the rough ET golf course and so if we could do that i would also like to do the representation review before i go to lunch as well so and the South New Brighton motor camp so if I could do 25 26 and 27 but I 'll do them on the other order I 'll do 26 25 26 27 and 25 and then I 'll go of is I have a lunch meeting it 's not a you know just that I want to go and eat or something and then in the exactly back is going to take over the chair and the break for lunch will be at one o 'clock so but that may mean that I 'll must the rest of the meeting which it 'll just have to be that way yeah golf course item and the I think I think must have for sell his lift lift the building okay so but well anyway but look I 'm would with the two local councillors like to move and seek and thus it right so David moves Glenn second and I think that I 'll just do a bit of an explanation to start with because because there will be a lot of people who are surprised to see this on the agenda and I think that with the interest in it I should really offer an explanation so having been new to the long-term planning process of a council I was not prepared for what the experience that we went through last year called the review of the activity management plan of the council so everything that the council does is governed really by an activity management plan and they sit within them certain levels of service but they have financial implications obviously because the levels of service will impact on the on the amount of funding that that the council devotes decision activities the question of the raphe to golf and that was something we were brand new throne unto when we first arrived and we said no no no don 't don 't put anything like that out onto a very distressed community at that at this stage we consistently spend time talking to people and we found the same of the South New Brighton motor camp which that camp which we had which was a very public issue prior to the election in 2013 and so in the course of the activity management plan process the item removing the funding for the rough et golf club at the conclusion of a process was what was included in the activity management plans and it went through that process perhaps without the the Jew attention of the counselors that that ought to have been expected and I must admit that during that whole process it seemed to me that it was a it was a poor process for decision making because local government decision-making is based on bringing bringing a paper to the council having options for the council to consider and for the council then to make a decision engagement around these decision-making processes before decisions are made the activity management plan process seems to have developed over the years as a mechanism for making decisions and a fastrack way but which doesn 't observe good practice because the consultation is the long-term plan process and so once I realized that we were trapped in the process I said I took legal advice as to whether we could get out of it and if you turn to page 273 of your report the legal implications are spelt out and this basically summarizes the legal advice that I receive the council is currently consulting with the community on its proposed LTP included in the information relied on and the consultation document is a proposal to close the rough PT golf course a large number of written submissions have been received from people and organisations with an interest in the matter overwhelmingly they 're opposed to the golf course closing the period for written submissions has ended the council will shortly be hearing people who want to present their views personally it can be expected that those who have already made heard will confirm their view that the core should remain open however the council will not make a decision on the matter until the consultation process has been completed and all submissions received with a verbal or written are considered in the meantime because the level of interest and retaining the golf course is so high approval is sought for staff to discuss with the rough et Golf Club the future of the facility in particular its financial viability the objective would be a solution that saw the course remain open but at no cost to the ratepayers if approval is given the intention would be to make the outcome of the discussions available to the council for consideration at the time it makes its decision and respect of the proposal people who still want to have their views who 'd will not be prevented from doing so nor from having those views included in the council 's deliberations it is important that the council retains an open mind if it does then it is open for the council to deal with the matter in this way without being in local government act 2002 now I 've read it out because I want people to understand that that we 're trapped and a process but what this paper what this authorization will enable will the capacity for us to make a different decision from the one that 's and the long-term plan if we decide to do to do so because we retain an open mind about the matter it rather then saying at the end of the process of the long-term plan we want staff now to go to the community to see if it can be run at no cost to the council so this enables us to make a much more short track process but the only regret that I made was that I accepted the the original legal advice and didn 't do this earlier so but once we get to the to the hearings and we discover that people want to come and sit before the council and say the same thing for five minutes over and over and over again because we 've got hundreds of submissions that want to repeat this I kind by saying to the community there is another way that we could resolve this matter so that 's that 's really the fundamental outline as to why this paper as being brought before us now clean thank you me and if we say the same thing but in different ways I agree with that obviously they 're going to be some big learnings coming out of this in terms of how the systems and the processes have put out messages to the community over both this and the next report I 'm thinking we and I think this is the role of the people committee which has two counselors on it they presume a kind of a political filter but we need that in my view through the organization who are not politicians but we need kind of those filters built-in and peps and our reporting templates when it comes to reports a sort of a social impact your financial implications are set for a built in but I think we need but we can t of this happening again no no but I think it 's the activity management decision-making process so I think we just need to change the sajan making process that activity management plan shouldn 't be seen as an opportunity to make fundamental changes that should be subject to community engagement that long-term plan process is not the engagement that you would want to focus your attention on issues like these I mean you can have multiple engagements at once during a long-term plan process but it needs to be better notified than us yep David thank you look I totally support this move here and Empress just looking and looking over the whole situation the the Robert E domain was originally gifted to the community way back in the early 1900s and the golf course established somewhere in the 1930s and it 's the only sort of 18-hole public golf course where people can get on without clashing with club commitments the community involvement and running of community facilities is totally compatible with our council objectives and I think what we 're doing here is totally in line with that there 's a history of council not being particularly great operators of council facilities considerable concern raised in the community with the potential closure of yet another facility so look I totally support this notion of entering into discussions with the roarty golf club and I I note that we want to manage the various risks associated 3.4 of the port and find a way to perhaps some negotiate with the club and mitigate the various rules and regulations around establishing safeguards for council and going through this process but I think ultimately we can achieve a win-win situation that 's both a great outcome for the community of the eastern suburbs golf club itself so i think we 're we 're going now is a very very good way to resolve this issue Yanni then tongue um thank you I really appreciate this report really good to see that has options I was just concerned it and often stone that there 's a stone pub may not offer the best proposal to councils if they 're the only party involved and I just wanted to check in terms of legal advice that you receive given the local government requirements to ensure that we gone through that test because it is a new requirement that we previously haven 't had and with that symptoms in there does raise an issue for me as the riddle we 've tested it against I think that 's a risk that we need to mitigate so essentially it 's just identifying it and we need to make sure that when we discuss these issues that sir it 's a balanced negotiation I think that we would normally we would normally go out and and to an expression of interest if the if if we were expecting to be financially recompense but we 're not we 're expecting this to be run at no cost to the council it is the consumers in terms of what we have to do under the LGA which has reviewed a cost-effectiveness of current arrangements for meeting the needs of communities within the district or region from good quality by golf infrastructure public services and we have to do that in a way that 's you know I guess gets the best value for poor people so but it 's got any proposal to rates capital or operational a full financial analysis of any proposal will be presented to the council as part of the council 's decision making process this enables it to come back to us for a decision at the same time that we determine the LTP right so if someone wanted to come in and put a proposal and I think we haven 't gone through all the submissions OCD but if they said hey look we can pay you five thousand dollars a year and make the proper and return of te we still have to be open to that through that process yeah that 's right we won 't have discussions with those people we will have discussions with the golf cart I think the golf club has already been talked to and and and so has the the other obvious one much as the refugee sports club there and essentially they 've said their a backstop of the golf club can 't_''_825.68 can 't provide I mean there 's a local solution that 's a 11 but you know ask a second question related to this quick sort of scenes that is other facilities that we have em up a closure and lt pay for the activity management plans what 's the price it for us to enter into the same sort of discussions we 've got the South brush and one next but I don 't know I don 't know do you you boys got a consistent process through this I guess it 's part of coming up with options yeah and if you want to raise those as part of this process that we have discussions at that stage yeah I mean there 's no he raised I 've made no secret that I 've initiated this I took legal advice I was told that we weren 't allowed to do this but but we 've found a way within the legal framework to do this so yeah so basically what i should take from that is if i want to get something happening similar to foreign away then well there 's no council resolution to door okay there 's no point by Tim I mean I support this process I think we our facility yeah Tim and then Bucky yeah I 'm just want to pick up the point I just disagree with David 's comments with cows care facilities teams I think they 're doing excellent job generally the facilities we run quite difficult pools etc and I think they do a fantastic job so i just i know there was difficult sand difficulties at times and differences of opinions but um I just want to just clarify that and I had my support yeah I think I don 't think that an intention was to undermine yep but the comment was in relation to the golf club yeah um Vicki I think the concept of bringing mr. Forrester days excellent thank you for doing that and I think we made a gif in terms of lucky like we wanted to close the golf club which wasn 't the object of the exercise the object as I saw it was to remove the right path from the golf club and find a better way of or a cheaper way for other a pace of the golf club maintaining and staying there a legal way to do what you 're doing it 's excellent in relation to foreign OE there are two issues one is the potential closure of the pool which is not until some years after this and is certainly not in the first year plan when we come to consider the long-term plan I will definitely suggest that we don 't look at closing it the other is the reopening of the recreation center and work is already happening on it because I 've just had an email about it so that 's all cool so thank you for that clear epsom clean but may just speak to the debate on I 'm happy with the lease arrangements here no it 's not a straight out comparison with it with the next this is quite next item that is quite kind of case might I might swap the order because I really want to tie right everybody oh and on there 's a lot of state to keeping these discussions going yes there are a lot of other golf courses around but the that area but they 're private history and that respect run runs us some on Golf Academy so I think you it 's quite unique so for f ed I think it 's can see Sam and I hear it 's really important that we keep these discussions going yep all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried well done thank you thank you _"

    "text": "who 's not at the community board conference why not no no parte matters but you have an issue you want ray Goulet Otto Marin counselors and yeah I 'm not at the board conference because I got to go and my first term and our deputy chair Carolyn Potter is because she hasn 't been for some years and so I think all the community boards have been represented which is great I just wanted to draw your attention to a few meters firstly item number two and this first report just about the we we had we 'd made a decision about the Barrington bus interchange at the Barrington shop shopping center and there was quite a lot of public pressure not not to approve any changes or to get rid of it entirely and things like that but the community would really believe strongly in public transport but we were prepared to hear some people who weren 't able to present to that and we ended up holding our position and asking for view of investigations but I mean it 's this interchanges really we chose the into the future I 'm talking about not necessarily 10 years but 20 years that the interchange in this area would actually be would be worthy of the name um in one of the questions was a request we requested that staff investigate the introduction of a 30 kilometer per hour speed limit and Ethel since trip with the interchanges and I guess there 's a broader question around that about it when we start to talk about delegations if we could if boards would be able to give options to communities of slowing their residential streets I think they 'll be really good and making the more pedestrian and cycle friendly and and moving on I just wanted to thank the council very much for supporting the community board and supporting the community around Barrington playground there 's a great example of partnership between us and in us in the community in yeah so thank you very much i think it was a unanimous of counsel and thanks to deputy mayor back for her work on that and to our counselors as well it 's a great outcome in two community board meeting minutes so that 's you you 'll move that Phil and tongue Yanni just really interested in the kashmir club in the projects lost but you probably do counselors that were here when we did our central city plan heard from the squash club without the desire to work with the metro sports and have a you know contribute financially either to the stadium the new stadium of the new metro sports and have their scholarship sources there so I was kind of interested to see that they 're now looking at Kashmir and whether there was any consideration of to vary the Metro sports all the new stadium as being a place where they might have liked to have gone I mean the great thing about this kashmir club thing as it doesn 't come at any cost to counsel and they the kashmir club has been very generous to counsel and community board and hosting meetings and things like that and they came to us unprompted on their own out of their own volition to talk to us about this proposal when they didn really good I mean I guess if part of the consideration for Metro sports and and the Pune wires around squash facilities you know no then obviously that needs to be taken into consideration but so just from the squash cops point of view they didn 't raise any desire to be in the central city no um Tim with this this was a specific pro program that they talked about this is it so it 's not nothing to do with the other programs with it was in the central city or whatever this is was just them to come to the community board to share with us what they were proposing get feedback from us and the community but as Paul qui said that there 's no funding required from Council etc that I 'm their own and it doesn 't affect any of your other programs for the future than that and that was the same when they came to counsel to say they 've got insurance money from their damaged facilities and could they work with us in partnership with some of the big anchor projects the presence in the central city and i 'll just try to understand if this is instead of that or whether this is kind of complimentary it 's not instead of it like this isn 't okay so as I 'm no no I think we 'll there are yep um Andrew thank you um page 142 item 8.1 a community seminar regarding the port hills similar to that help of a heathcote river obviously there are three Ward 's got the port hills partially in them the spray booth Kegley ferry meet and littleton mount Herbert was any consideration brought into that discussion of extending this out to the three Ward 's or including all of those communities is we 'd like all stakeholders including all the community boards involved in that just as we were when we hold another one discussing the heath get river have record and we 're gross Bradley and Hector fear in me you know because these are issues that affect us all and the port hills important to everyone so I mean I really encourage as many counselors as possible to be involved the responsibility for the port hills is divided between private landowners the council and end the summit road society and those other societies and and we don 't get everybody in the same room very often in fact I 'm not aware of any time since I 've been a communicable that that 's happened so it would be great to look at how we might be better stewards of the port helps and their issues okay i see paula was there and a different hat on yeah yeah i 'm i just want to comment that i want to congratulate the board and around the Barrington medical center and the bus interchange issue and it could have been easy to back off was a lot of local opposition and I commend the board for hull standing your ground sue me the delays would in any way for filter ball so what people you know appreciate that counselor Clearwater I mean we were really careful with the process and make sure did you know as much as possible that we could involve make sure that everybody was represented and that can also add to that following that decision I know the staff have had ongoing discussions with the medical center as to how it could be workable yeah and I do I have to acknowledge that willingness of the staff to work constructively with the Medical Center is I 'm really pleased with that right now you wanted Melanie to spend that 's in the next report they 're both being dealt with together I just said that oh sorry I 'm sorry I see the two reports are being dealt with together 20th March seventeenth of April yeah sorry well thank you I will we 'll come to that issue in a second I just wanted to mention to point to which is this the second part of it the 65 sandwich road now this is a building that was the council and tranche one of the facilities rebuild program allocated about 450 thousand dollars it 's not here at who 's listed building but it is a building that was built by the council in the depression and it helps the st. manager power plant a toy library the earthquake and the community board is his indicator that we 'd like them to consider options but there 's been a bit of a bump in the road and that there was another curious report done instead of instrument of 450 thousand dollars to repair which it met by thought was a bit exalt in any way it 's come back at six hundred fifty thousand dollars which is a bit of a gold-plated one that the the toy library really really needs a place at the moment there and we 're very unsatisfactory situation they used to be the largest toy library in the south island and they 've dwindled numbers and they really really do need a decision on the future of sandwich road but it would you know it is an old building but it is fit for their purpose so and is they didn 't they weren 't wanting any kind of upgrade before and I just wanted to you know because ultimately it 's the council 's decision i just wanted to point that out and that we do have a community group and to the community they want to be back in their community but it needs to be dealt with thank you yep and and Melanie is here to talk about the who and hey the former hoon a volunteer library um so the library was closed a couple of months ago maybe three months ago and then we were looking to see if there was any community you still desire to use that building which is actually relatively sports only 53 square meters and has a toilet and is very simple with no phone line or anything else so I put out some flyers put some messages on social media and we we usage went into this on Bo and I got quite a few groups coming back large and small who are interested so I put together on that interest and pass it over to both the communities their arm advisors in there and our board and also there 's gone to the property team and I had a few more since seem that I haven 't passed on but so there 's quite a lot of interest basically from are wanting to support parents and things like that in some of them are from the East people groups that haven 't got somewhere since four years ago so and one of them was 22 years at part time so I can see how they could work together and some of them have money as well that they could put towards building something there 's quite large back section at the back where they could build storage facilities or another meeting room or something like that so to me it seems like a wonderful opportunity to keep their as a community facility yeah we 're playing it because it 's ultimately going to be council 's decision and it 's just it 's not soup us to requirements and dear community was just crying out for space thank you good could I ask a couple of questions but they straddle both reports please give me they 're both been taking yeah yeah we 've expended a lot of time on this report okay I 'll beat we through okay the first questions about the smoke-free signage I 'm fascinated this working on this through the community housing and economic development with revisiting our smoke free outdoor policy have you got an update on that we don 't have an update from this report but the information that we had was said that there is a council policy and I didn 't want to dilute the effect of the council policy by having different type of signs that they would have go and have a look and see if the council signs were there or not and make sure that they were that it or next questions about the next report the bone veil door knocking exercise about who carry that out at some point group of volunteers from various organizations coordinated by I think tearing and they did got that amazing work and they 've done it out east and west as well and they found some very interesting things out around you know the fact that one of the things I didn 't realize is the level of damage in the hills to both homes and infrastructure and then you know sort of under appreciated that the level of in our ward you 'll see the damage is huge when you talk to people you know they are very stressed out about insurance issues about finding accommodation and things like that but we kind of knew it 's nice to have a third party confirm that and to offer that hospital support and there 's no you know to keep privacy issues tight all right so um i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thanks very much thank you I 've got to leave the meat _"

putting out generations that is our credentials to come and speak today I 'll up about this to that as simple as that the old moldy system of monarchy tomor to us as a core of this it was always a reciprocal thing from your families when they they for want of a better word would term they adopted a Parker family and to support that the Aloha that was shown was permission to to occupy man came in two stages firstly to occupy and secondly to build out the build site there 's never a change of title was purely from my heart as the multi-tier Memphis Isis monarchy dollar one of the things I find quite extraordinary lessening this morning that the the big hearty the old people disappear in one year the building was made this is Marty I find that quite extraordinary the benevolence of the old people on the strength and then that they 're giving us was just went amount of 12 months but kids wait that 's part of our history and so it 's not yet at all in his time with the old people have gone I am a Solomon and I heard I wasn 't aware of any a private thing I 'm a Solomon i 'm also at eco on a mon or 220 kind of families in the bay where that responsibility comes a time the people who bequeathed permission it 's time to handle impact it 's given for certain time for a certain period that to share arrow ha and in the in the beauty of our bay those all people have long since gone we have new wants and needs i heard the word subdivision but that 's no subdivision we wish to build it will probably be only too because we 're not financial to holiday on z which will be available for all and not just just modi three if we can find the finance but I 'd somehow doubt it the other thing I think is important to emphasize us is that the Memorandum of Understanding we 've developed with City Council now that was with angels rest to go down was the formation of a BBQ coin area facilities along the beach to share with the community they would upgrade the road which would allow us to build the and don 't we proved our commitment as well how part of commitments the riparian fence end up and to plant cocooning stream which is the name of the little stream which is next to to the patch we 've done that but completely riparian fenced it we 've planted over 9000 trees and we 're part of a walkway which will go up to our Pope our ancestor carvings which up on the ridge and when we come dead and another gully which we have already right pier fenced but via to plant which will be a circular walk way round up to the poem and back down to the beach again this is for the community that is we get no benefit from it at all that I think probably the strongest significant thing for us it removes the pressure from way from the front of the model which is a very popular camping not with hip and camping but for BBQ area but it gives a facility they 're entirely for the for the for the community of of Canterbury and who else wishes to be there monarchy Tonga and it 's multi sense we had the same example next to the morrow where permission was given by the old people for for another one of those families to build on a section they bought now they 're not only built on that section but they bought on a fair chunk of ours as well and to top it off they planted a fortress than they fenced it all off of course the tradition over the years the land went from being our land to their land now as an issue we had to address it 's exactly the same position as we see it now with a position of angels risks we rectified that we put the fencing back but we left enough room as is our way so that they could mow and then it 's sort of actually sup and down the side of that that local and even though their jugular house is still in our land but that 's the way we are it 's not about going out and purposely being vindictive or whatever tell me like you have to come for perspective we have a row we have a duty to perform to our future generations roll the old people gave to their land that time has changed and it 's time to return the land to its rightful owners we had also very much like for that to happen to the island of the foreshore as well we 're patient people 150 years of colonization has proved but one can but hope so I have nothing more to say on it to us it 's a gentle up yes we acknowledge the people of occupied and keep that warm at land warm on our behalf and we thank them for it but it 's time it 's time for the land of returned to its rightful owners get by no Miguel Cotto your thank you very much for your for your presentation as I indicated before I think that the issues are extremely challenging and you know we respect the position that that you bring to the table as decision makers on this matter we have to take into account all of the all of the legal issues as us so I would like to leave it there and i would like to deal with this as the as the next item on our agenda so that we can seek the additional information that we require before we can make a decision on a yacht I thank you nan sorry yonni thank you thank you and on that note could I turn to item _"

relook at all of the haircut reserved know if there 's other reserves called heathcott east bernard reserve in other parts of the heath go yeah then you know I don 't know whether how this is connected but as long as it 's being checked off so it doesn 't add to confusion when people try and find it on the gps and end up ten kilometers away yes fine that 's why I was just asking if the process of spin Fingal okay well why don 't we why don 't we take the staff recommendation approve the proposed reserved names subject to subject to a clarification around around those subject to

green area is the role reserve where become the door to adjoining the new new subdivision yeah right so you 'd like I 'm invited to move yes and perky look like to second the discussion that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's Carrie what a physique we community board is this a second one is also parte de guarding the richland order at an intersection with the row is quite heavy traffic afloat and also currently the intersection of forestry and the Recondo the f of z brother kind of petition close it but in the last five years you know have a car a stand or petition excellent for many times and also compared to some other the zebra petitioner closing so they would like to upgrade facility as a signal petitioner closing but one issue is are because the during our community board meeting the are one of the artery shop in order ladies Terry shop the businessmen and the surrounding residence they raise this issue in a community board meeting particular concern if we upgrade this kind of signal facility where we move lost a kind of Kappa in front of that era shop so the the comic book consider this kind of situation so accept the 5.4 in the 5.9 these two hrs remove those car park but a cannibal request a staff in republic we got into this one whether consider in the that the other crap Hackel ever part in five minutes you know in the area lender to to make 5.9 yeah okay um so do you want to move that allowed to move the community board and the board recommendation yes and are you happy to sicken that Bucky right illness yeah yes ok so you what 's up you know screw in terms of numbers the others but what does one economy ask about is can we be assured that since a staffer what 's going back to the board that 's agreeing to all the other recommendations today is still workable I 'm just wanting to make sure that the whole whole all of the clauses war yes the whole community board was unanimous and staff were very good about finding a solution so Pereira street has a very dangerous intersection and signal izing it is it 's very much supported because there 's a whole pile of kids crossing the Air Force and Teresa 's the issue is that there 's a dairy right on that corner and he wants to maintain some parking they 've found a way of shortening the median strip so that one park at least can be maintained yeah just for board consider the impact of the likely bus priority line through the center section doesn 't go through that intersection well my attorney was that we had a plan for a bus priority I hope center street brooklyn road Nestle player stops further up the road I understand the current consultation but I thought the overall plan was a bus priority lame dump wicked and road and I just wanted to check whether this has been future proof or considered as part of this design yes it did consider those and it considered the impact on bicycles which is not ideal unless it a circumstance and so it may well be that the that the five minute parking cannot be sustained into the long term but the considered view of the community and the community board was that it could at least in the short term it 's not the best solution for cyclists I have to say and we probably do need to look at it in another couple of years it just needs a bit more width in that road I just I guess the obvious question for 't just as much as I hate it signal eyes the intersection where should have wider benefits to possibly buses cyclists and pedestrians rather than just what 's being proposed it wasn 't the safest place to do it yes also need there were two rails on it yes show every possibility was completed yea yea big issues right yeah because recently the council I have a kind of honk honk consultation of a moment stop received the eight either the kind of deputation and they have the publication on the current listen Teresa the church hall you know I one day I was in there and dep you male 1 when one day was in there no there 's my person view is the part of you people express their concern polish the pasta called along the hole licked and walk rather than list of pt 's additional closing the small issue yes lobby thank you so I will Oh Andrew I 'm just coming back to this business of the p5 parking space in the board recommendation in ice and seven does that align with what nourish Patel twenty so one parking space would meet his qwest so weird so the board 's recommendation is a theme yeah and he was comfortable with the way that it went all right great thank you all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all right as opposed say no that 's carried and now the reporters a whole be adopted I think the key buckle move that and Jimmy channels second baby all right i

    "text": "someone like to move Glen David that that report first report be received up what that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the meeting of the ninth of April oh I see that with the two of them were together the theater match in the ninth of April move on to the the twentieth of April and sorry i was going to look for some change to the wording so I 'd like to well I 'd I want to move an amendment that is that is I want to move something different to that so if we can go to that the council or Rick yes 6.1 so I 'd say it 's the board recommendation so come down to the board recommendation so 1.1 should read so just just ed add in a new paragraph at the stage saying request the mayor and the chief executive to meet with the Ministry of Education and the two schools in order to explore the range of options with respect to the sale of a portion of queen elizabeth the second park for essentially the pointers is that Colleen and I would meet with the with the Ministry of Education and the two schools in order to look at what the options are because there 's been a bit of tension and the community around around the location of the sporting center and so I kind of want to get my head around what the issues are and I want to lift it right up to two high-level no I 'm not going to have I think that we 're going to I think that it 's important that Carlene and I get a helicopter view of what 's going on but also what the options are so I suddenly think you know the Ministry of Education wants some land from the council they have land that the council might be interested on for example the new brighton community have already said publicly they want the ROI stokes hall to remain on community ownership and use and so there are a number of conversations that we could have there are some primary school sites that have been vacated it would be very good any form of housing so again we could be having some conversations with them around land swaps rather than simply looking at a financial return and I know that it would be it would be better to lift that right out of the organization structure so that 's why I 'm not keen to authorize staff to go down a unilateral discussion with the Ministry of Education before we 've had that high-level conversation and I know that counselor East is going to ask that the counselors be involved in that process but if the counselor is involved in the community boards going to want to be involved and then and you know and I just I want to have that initial conversation without having any one and a and a yeah and a different I want to be able to have a high level conversation to see what the options truly are before anything else as occurred I 've observed the process around pirate park I 'm not entirely happy with how that has how that has occurred and I don 't want that to happen again with us right outcome so so i 'm not i 'm just trying to reconstruct this ghetto cool yeah in a ménage but i haven 't got a second to yet anyway so authorized staff so i 'm just thinking okay so put back but i 'm i 'm just thinking with 1.1 which needs come first yeah so that 's right so so we 'll make yeah and and then but basically so it 's 1.12 and then the mirror and the chief executive can authorize staff to commence unilateral discussion so we 're not going to hold it up but it means that after after we have met and established what the possibilities are then we authorized staff to convince those and discussions and i think the the use of the word unilateral was just to refer to the fact that we don 't have to deal with any other party we don 't have to go out onto the out to the market to see who else is in the market for qe2 that we 're simply only interested in there and the Ministry of Education yep yep yeah course of action I would just merely ask that could the two counselors in the area be briefed on the outcome of those discussions before we hand it over the stuff absolutely yeah that 's absolutely fine and in fact that at that point it might be worthwhile to brief the staff our brief the two counselors for the ward and the community board yep so that yep so if you would put and before that the mayor and chief executive will brief shall just put the beer with Pegasus community board because then it 's inclusive yep prior to authorizing staff and that 's that 's fine yep yani I 'm happy with that but I do think I mean Ava so kills us from the heat record and Oh Karen visiting any discussion around any other land that 's near the Hebrew pyramid walk but object so we would obviously it isn 't board life is also be our intention is only to discuss land that 's inside the booooored Pegasus ward yep yep thank you there might be one or two resolutions within the build Pegasus board meeting one for instance is that the entire board and along with the local Member of Parliament support retaining the raw steaks hall and community ownership so that kind of you know that way its strength to in conversations we could get our board advisor to those upper floor yeah but I did note that your community board also said that it was open to collaboration over the location between the schools and the east and recreation Sports Center but notes strongly that it does not want to see the school 's take preference over the side so I mean all I 'm saying is that yes we will take that on board but I think it 's really important that we have a bigger conversation about what 's possible in terms of all of their land holdings I understand that the community totally wants to have accessibility to the site and and location of the eastern sport and rick is really really important and I want the Ministry of Education to understand that but that it can 't_''_554.18 be a competition it 's got to be an integrated beast 's fair to say my colleague here and I are getting antsy we want this to continue and we also want to retain a good relationship with the Ministry which we felt was the air yeah I think so yeah and I mean the thing you know that the trouble was is that a lot of you know and you know nature abhors a vacuum so if there 's a vacuum of information there 's a whole stack of information that piles unto it informed and uninformed facebook has become the the measure by which nature fills the fills the vacuum and there has been a lot of commentary around you know the length of the pool and various other things it 's a red hearing it 's got nothing to do with anything that 's holding things up and I think by having the mirror and the chief executive deal directly with the Ministry of Education there will be no room for any misunderstanding about how urgent a priority this is for our community don 't think this is a great great outcome great good all right so I those opposed say no that 's carried great thanks _"

    "text": "what Oh deal quickly with not item number five because I don 't think there 's oh no that will go straight to item number six yep thank you I 'll keep thinking the same community board but they 're not yeah Marina what I know as you can see this is a complex and quite an emotive issue which the board has been struggling a bit with counselors now that you have heard two positions I 'm on record as having said that I have some concerns about the process and I 'm just wondering whether that would be shared by come you would think about having another look at that because that this report does not accurately describe the process that has happened in full I 'm stand by the board 's recommendation because I think it is the right decision in this case but as I 've seen I 'm a little uncomfortable about the process by which we write it yeah I mean I feel exactly the same way having listened to both in respecting the position of both I think it is extremely complex and you know so I don 't believe that that these matters can necessarily be best resolved by adopting a legal position but i 'm also very mindful of the factors the mirror of christchurch that we have legal obligations that we have to take into account when we are making decisions so i would really like to let this matter lie on the table to enable some three the discussions to take place but at the same time for some further advice to be prepared on us for us I also believe that as you have identified that the report that we have in front of us to make a decision on doesn 't actually accurately reflect the process that we 've had described to us by both sides the history of the ownership you know on on both sides and the history of what the implications are in terms of paying rates and any other matters that have been addressed so you know it seems to me that we are not in a position to make a decision on this the the report itself as an adequate for a probably little comfort to people who are seeking the council to make a decision but we also have legal obligations but also broader than legal obligations I think representative obligations to the people of Christchurch that we ensure that good processes are followed and I 'm not satisfied that we have followed a good process in this regard so if people are comfortable with this I don 't know do we need an actual resolution to to do this well i will move that the item lie on the table to enable further discussions and to seek further advice as there a seconder for that Tim yani I just wanted to check with Paula with the chair of the community board I know this council had planned and and probably still does to go and meet him awry with the local renata so just wondering whether that would be something that would be useful as part of this process there seem to be a number of other issues that were raised things like the funding for the wider landscape plan things like the subdivision in terms of the number of MoU which I don 't see in this report so do you think it would be useful for us as a council to reemphasize that commitment and re-establish that desire to go and meet with the local rune occur at their morale as we did previously could we deal with their as a separate issue because I don 't want to get that tied up with this particular one issue so I don 't mind if you deal with this separately but I 'd like to deal with this matter individually because this is not dependent on that process is completely separate so could I just please yani deal with this separately well I 'm fine for that but I did the reason I was raising their I know why you are raising it look at you please could you please no I 'm I don 't want to rule you out of order but could I please deal with this matter on its own is this matter we heard from the deputation reference to an MoU which none of us at in you yani we have asked that the seek further advice we don 't need to have a discussion about what that advice will contain le thanks and I 'm just I know Paul he 's got a question related to this as well but I 'm just looking at the map this is the clarification some like it starfish you would you want to do that yes I 'd rather be issues that were offline so that we can we can get all of the matters that we wish to seek further advice on dealt with away from this occasion so if people were comfortable with it i will put that motion a bigger pardon there is nothing to debate it 's a it 's a procedural motion and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried would you like to continue with your thought yes there 's just one other thing I 'd like to highlight highlight its item 11.7 a metre about the normal pool raised and elected members information exchange and I just like to report that we had a really good meeting with be involved in the running of the pool he 's of the position that he would really like to employ some local people part time and train them up to support the running of the pool and and we 've got a sort of way forward to look at how that would happen and then the conversation then turned to the future management of the left and Recreation Center and he was very open to the possibility to of setting up a management committee or in some way having a council community partnership for the future running of that women opens up and that 's all fantastic news as far as we continue next fun yes sure people be volunteering his view was that it would be better to employ them and have a straightforward you know relationship that way and we reasonably optimistic would be able to find some people in our community who would who would be keen to do that find is like yeah it 's as lifeguards and I 'm apparently the pool with that pool you have to be able to do everything like manage 's a bit of training involved yeah but that 's good news yeah a perky does that enable you to open the normal people longer it may do right cool where we 're coming from okay excellent all right but some one night to move that their port be received yep can 't_''_517.14 cancel Jana Henson 's request about like it just seems to me in terms of the whole report that it would be sensitive and sensible for us to make it to make a visit to the local row and counsel your hands and raise that question and I think we will be helpful to ever reply I 'm happy to respond in general terms I think with whenever you 've got a report that is about a particular place it 's really useful to us at that place if you came and secondly you 're always welcome to come to our wood and we we hoped after the election that you would come and do a tour but it never happened so please do we will all right so would someone like to

Ramsden advised that the removal of the batch would enable the tea runner to complete projects that that would benefit the community the reasons why our batch should remain we believe that the council elects justification compassion and blatant disregard to our rights this has been intensified use rights and until recently we 're all the understanding that add legal right to occupy the Christchurch City Council had until now accepted this right or as of 2010 this is supported and knowledge by the family paying rates until 2010 the rates were assessed for both lend and improvements which supports the family 's rights as a range of evaluation active they have always believed we have always believed that we 're rightful owners and that our right is perpetual perpetuity as security this is sorry I 'm a bit emotional the property changed ownership in 1990 but within the family and no recourse was made by the council or any other party to suggest otherwise that we shouldn 't be there the rights were breached in 2010 when the council notified us that they were a process of advising us we must remove the home batch after 75 years of occupation due to the council stipulating that no lease exsisted and at the batch occupied valuable public space on the foreshore and its removal will enable projects that benefit the community valuable public space on the foreshore community an addition that would enable the tea runner to complete projects that they believe benefit their community to date no detail detail landscaping plans have been presented or community communicated to us apparently says underlying and justification for the removal of the batch the only plans they have seen relate to the proposed building division of four new dwellings located on the section behind us these plans were amended to three as the council and former area that due to our back for four units would not be likely to be proceeded with under the district planning and we were questioning whether those proposed subdivisions are projects that would better service the community it 's our opinion that the batch forms part of Port levy and the structure has historical significance that is our opinion that should be protected as a historical building and refurbished for future generations the rich history of the building angels rests in the error should be retained the authentic Kiwi batch forms part of New Zealand culture and the great Kiwi dream this is Evan at the Museum throughout New Zealand and his Christ short-sighted and it 's not on the community 's best interest we believe there are better and more viable alternative space on information provided and all evidence to hand the current proposals like depth and appears to be more about economic gain and community spirit our family wishes to remain in Port levy and wants all generations to enjoy this iconic beautiful land we call home or a batch we 're happy to engage with the council the Erie and the community forum you know for mutual beneficial resolutions but a history the batch was built in the late the wall that was built in late nineteen thirty nine by mr. Nicholson and it was bought by Tracey 's grandfather Clarence Beaumont in 1940 it 's been in the family since that time and it 's now controlled by us the Stuart family maintainer well maintains it controls use of the batch but it 's always available to other members of the family the B Crofts the walkers what sort of thing can 't think of it anyway rd Audrey his side of the family Georgie someone important Jason holder in 40 was an astute businessman he would he would not have been visited in the batch without either an agreement with the Mount Herbert County Council all the crown and this would obviously have been obtained before the landing of 1948 we can 't prove that but then therefore the council can 't prove that it wasn 't there either rates the local government act 2002 rating Act states that rating information database must be kept and that either written or electronic or both it also states that rates cannot be charged on road reserves under the Act therefore why were rates demanded Clarence reminds produced up to and including all this 2010 if we did not have any rights the project city councillor stated that they do not record records or do not have the records due to amalgamations over the years and that would be understandable because it was the Mount Herbert County Council in banks peninsula and now of course Christchurch City so yeah as we have occupied here since nineteen forty we do not we don 't think we need to prove they exist though there and therefore it 's up to crotchet City Council to prove otherwise we also believe that we have in the past had an agreement with the T runner for the use of the land and the reason for that is that every year from nineteen forty until nineteen sixty seven money was paid to mr. Solomon for the rental of the land why did he collect payment if the land is the Council of crowned own who would know the asset has a 2014 rateable value of a t-1000 that 's the capital value at 2004 the land and 61,000 for improvements might ask why do we pay rates on as demand it reliance is quite simple if we did not pay we would not we being penalized and we never at any stage thought we should not pay as everything suggests that we had some rights especially as we were paying rates on 40 square meters of land if this had previously been married customary land then again it is not readable and because we were rated suggest we should have had rights to occupy therefore the presumption occupy after taking control of the back from the first owner due to the fact we have not been asked to vacate the location until 2010 when the tea runner and the City Council approached the city council occupation of the site so surely we should have been asked to move much earlier if we were not entitled to be there and on in the 1940s there was a Mary Church situated with the public taller desert re and port levee that 's the area where our batches it 's got its own little main then there was Angel 's rest which is our batch so called as the Mary graveyard is situated on the other side of the printer angels risk and it 's believed that that was where the angels used to wait to carry the spirits from the church to the graveyard that church was buried down in 1945 we know that because Tracy 's mother was 14 so it had to be 1945 history books have it anywhere between nineteen forty and the late fifties but it was not in 45 and I and I wonder that church was still standing we have always got on well with the permanent residence and Holly Holliday makers are like if we have turned up at the batch and has been people and our grounds barbecuing or whatever we 've never said bugger off we own this we 've let them stay with syd know you 're here doesn 't matter it 's only barbecue picnic what the hell it doesn 't matter so five years in our pasts since this has all started and you know we just want to know what why we 're in this situation really we were called to a meeting at crotchets to the council and februari with mr. wing win chi-ching and mr. Justin Simms so they could gather information to present to the community board at that meeting it was intimated that the council usually will try and reposition people to a similar type of place in situations such as ours however they see it out of such a unique spot we may not be able to place in a similar situation we did not mind where they put us in we haven 't yet had an official offer of relocating or anything read the Mount Herbert County Council a little to mount hermon community board rather meeting on Wednesday of the 18th we were advised that both we in the arena were allowed to have two speakers each and that each speaker was to be pre nominated and allowed five minutes to speak we were asked to speak first and we did the tea runner spoke second however once they had finished they hit a third person speak on their behalf that person was mr. Adrian to put a board member who had seconded the motion to have the batch remove mr. Potter I understand previously workers earn our hetalia development and he has strong ties with the local a we should need he not of distance themselves from this process he spoke of how they looked after the land for 800 years etc this should be in the minutes and both Tracy and I sincerely believe he was a third speaker for the tea runner and we don 't know why they were allowed three and even though in nothing to say but he was the second speaker so was that not a conflict of interest and summary the little to mount her be bought Herbert community port has recommended to you that we demolished the batch at our expense the community board comprises of six members to which stood down to a perception that a conflict of interest may be perceived and we questioned the Board 's decision it 's our opinion that the batches should not be demolished or removed we believe that we have existing use rights and that the recommendations put to the council lust yet let justification and compassion the family has been prominent and portly there for 75 years and we feel that we have a good relationship with the community we believe who have strong ties with community and we wish to remain it 's our opinion that the bachelors does not diminish public space nor does it obstruct person 's rights of passage the batch is bound by a foreshore and a small creek and the joins rural land and the symmetry the land adjacent to the bachelor the first Anakin with a small toilet I would like to ask the question the small land path that the batch is occupied for 70 years what additional value do you believe you could provide that just above I justifies not only your foregoing our rights but also just also destroying history our family also point out that prior to the notice in 2010 and we had air Mac the batch to fully restore it and refurbish it but obviously that hasn 't happened and and that 's the end of that I suppose really thank you yeah but on Tracy to it and ice I 'm speaking from the heart basically because it 's part of my family heritage and I just wanted to say that five years ago we were approached by the Runanga who came to our our own home and talk to us about their proposal for some reason they took our meeting as a done and dusted yes we have agreed well that definitely did not happen at our meeting and it 's our little piece of paradise that is full of family memories we 've always had had many of being invited to honey 's barbecues quiz nights whatever was happening along at the Runanga we were always always included in likewise when people were walking past our place the gate was always open for a cup of tea or in my father 's day a half g was always at the ready it sends us all to for it to be coming down to this this wouldn 't even be this wouldn 't meeting wouldn 't even be happening if someone hadn 't decided that our family history and our future do not seem to count or measure and therefore this new development can carry on regardless or speaking on behalf of our family we are all very passionate and saddened that we 're having to prove how important this little tiny piece of solitude and paradise as to all of us we were told at the community board meeting that this was a very emotive time for everyone of course it 's very emotional this is about our family history this whole process has been very stressful and upsetting for every member of our family the council and the Runanga visited the Bech about the fences all were told by the Runanga that the family had agreed for the Bech to go and what a surprise when we read that in the paper that was not what was agreed the community board have apologized for this and even even though they 've apologized it was very very upsetting for my elderly mother my mother who was 84 and has been through a lot over the last four years in the elderly more so I am sitting here today asking well we still have our mother please leave things as they are my four year old mother again would have attended this meeting but due to this whole thing being too upsetting for her she has asked me to speak on her behalf okay my father Clarence Beaumont bought the batch in good faith all those years ago for his family and future generations to enjoy and I am very saddened that this beautiful dream for all the family had come down to this I know here my mother was sitting the family holidays up for be mortified that the family was here today fighting for something so very very special to us all I only hope common sense is restored him today so many more family memories can be made its amazing little slice of heaven and she wanted me to just to say this this piece of paradise was meant to be there it survived the chilean earthquake tsunami has survived the wahine storm and survived the northwest winds of the 80 's and in 2011 earthquake the toaster fell off the shelf it 's for my mother and I would just like to end with us if this was happening to any one of you in this room I am sure you would be doing anything in your power as we are here to protect our small little piece of paradise for our future generations to share and enjoy just as my grandparents and my parents did before me thank you um I don 't hurt him really actually have too much and to add up them I think does it pretty much see everything I think probably from the outside the two think the Leki communication from this may change woods these two and input and let me compare Jim probably has a large party and come yeah what do we know so they had a better understanding of why the why you guys post Moke the batch and also the rationale so I guess are you standing back into the rationale that you 're on puts on need disregarding the right to occupy relates to the landscape plans in us to do with that and to do with the subdivision and I think knowing there 's a lack of depth and substance around that sort of process that 's pretty much and thank you very much i don 't think that there would be a single person in the room that wasn 't moved by that presentation and I I thank you for being so Frank and for ya foot for presenting and such a think yeah moving way so I can 't really say any more than that I obviously it we 're faced with a paper that we 're going to deal with shortly so it will come up on the matter so I would certainly invite you to remain for for the for the discussion but I think on the basis of what you 're presented today I think that it certainly has raised a number of questions for me that I would like to see answer before we make a decision so if that 's some comfort to you then I hope that that that 's something that the council will consider so thank you very much for your presentation and yeah thank you witches so if I could now invite Peter REM stone tips each year I 'm anaya Cunningham Secretary of te Runanga o called revaita and regarding item 6.1 to come forward _"

District Council that started that was you guys have inherited that will filter boots and 14 years ago when account books and number does that she happened at that time we had we have account with a meeting of all the counselors with both councils over at the club and we had a chat to the moment about it and they put aside 5.9 million for that for that protection of the public facilities and also for some land enhancement at that time now I understand that most of it is now gone or it 's been filled it up in different ways and they 're only small amount left on the land base and you have some council staff working on the land side which which is great Yorick banks and there we go and there 's that engage with us but of what you 're talking about level point the noble point we the combination of the mix mincha cruising Toby got thrown out of the end the hover and and the sea Guam see which is dinghies and kill boats and we started we formed naval point club not never point yacht club no point club quite specifically in 2001 to be an accompanying group which one it has for the whole community and a cover all water sports and already crashing groups in that area and this work particularly well and we now roots in got a very strong rocker armor part to us and we 've got peddlers and we 've got subs when surfing and that 's going credibly so we rips in like a thousand members at the moment and we are the public good part of this this area and we have been quite well we 're not for profit obviously and we 've pretty much self funding of what we do we 're in the situation a moment that the building which was little blue boarding under the turf face is now half wrecked and we walk in insurance came on buying part of that and summer appears we know we won 't get boarding to sent to do there it sort of works both were within the yellow line which underclock of Zion click on build on yeah so we know we have to move out so we ran Coast Guard of the same situation there further aunt was def the other area so we we 've combined with them to put together a community-based building which is we the naval point marine and rescue center and we 're going to go actively out for funding for that soon we 're doing a firmer Fifi fundraising fief for a fundraising feasibility study at the moment which which rule contributing to and require serious there with that sketch pen stomach David Hill and so we 're getting pretty organized and what 's happening what we 're concerned with us when you prepare the last page of the submission you 'll find that it 's pixel land in there and in the blue area is as what is currently zoned as the boat harbor zone and this in quite good rules around that zone which cover at the moment about recreational boats and facilities and and and businesses that will support those areas there 's a hatch deer in here which is understand from your staff that some of that area will become across for recreational use but we have quite a disconnect between the water of the recreation ground on this area here well it but apparently land and the ECAM plan would like to put their deport operations now we understand the right only for a period of time while they reconfigure themselves but they could be 20 years and it 's both important that the amount of metal and in here is absolutely too small for Canterbury is a great area for the recreational needs of what injury has if you look at any center around New Zealand and what they 've got available to them and launching ramps and recreational facilities for the marine industries that we are so far short we sell ourselves so short that it 's just not really acceptable as a city to do so we object and origins which we are opposing that and we obviously trying to get like to get your support on that part of it but is this the end the recovery plan yep yeah you know but sorry might as missionary we 're president Yeah Yeah right but what if we can see is that developed this area is quite important and we can see that we 've got a lot of skill sets we 've got a history in this area and we 'd really like to partner up with the the City Council and and trying to resolve this and work out how we can s do this and we 'd like to support of the City Council to do that the council take a position on earth cheering were here we kept our comments more to land side activity rather than the the water activities yeah but certainly just glancing through this there is some alignment be with what you said near some right yeah the area that the other brownie can said it was was out here the ye Ken seen pretty much lesser dairy alone and they didn 't really they talked over the port related stuff is often based on the port plant understand that it was an easy thing to do and they also dating made mention the City Council was a complex issue we think it 's a lot of different parameters have got to be dealt with we 'd really like to partner with the City Council and try and resolve this and get it together and we 'd like your support and doing that at the moment we were not listed in the long term plan and we think we should be and would like to find a mechanism that with move forward and work on it this is going through a recovery plan process at the moment so I mean we can certainly wear our submission lines up but but we are we presenting as the council presenting on there we will be in yeah we 've asked to be heard so we can yeah certainly speak to that and the I think it 's important that that the council I mean I presume you 're all over this yourself yeah but I 'm a local member here i 'm preparing your teams of that the conversation but and we 've told everyone to set aside all water shoes but but i also know that andries involved working party within council that was the interface with the recovery plan process so we haven 't quite a tired at amount of time with II can in the preparation of the draft as well and in fact there were some changes made to the the map that came out in the preliminary draft that you would have been happy to see those changes made so we what we tried to do is to suggest the the port operations area should be minimized to the extent it possibly could be to leave the maximum amount of space for recreational activities and boating activities so and that aligns perfectly with the concerns you 've expressed around this map here yeah whether it is great to hear ya so I 'm Tim I 'm the last piece on your own page three senators boating safety with regards to the ramps and or weather protection is the initial also that 14 years ago the marine of established or destroyed so prior to that being built both those ramps are open to the subtly yes so all just anything it was there was at space at U owners council okay that 's a waste of need so realistically any other that 's been going for more than 14 years both his rep going for ages 3 so these are fun it really kind of hard to argue to support something here when we 've got so much earthquake damage to do if you have 25 years yeah the safety issues have been out there are over there been here for a long period of time and the new room yet was in everyone 's grappled with that for quad it yeah the best thanks pensioners who counselled careful that as well one solution to that was put to put a marina and the which was going to do it now my not seduce you marina but there needs to be wave attenuation you get it if you look at the dynamics there 's and the population of crisis is like 20,000 boat owners and if those people tune up on on an always day go boating come back no solid he comes and they just about killed themselves on that rent trying to get know it comes back to i 'm a personal yes worthy and look at the rhythm yeah yeah but the rent you know there 's holla technical surrounded rents on the right property and issues that i 'm just wondering i mean are we able to progress the sphere they 're given that subject to a hearings process what can we take it offline so that our people you know yourself and the rest to the team can work directly with the but the such a year what do I think what 's happening with the plan is that that they haven 't really considered this and the e campaign they lived it to the council the clients was the owner of the land and and I think you knew I think we need to find a solution I think you need to find a solution and we were really want to contribute well it 's not covered by the recovery plan area the exchanges counted on the brownies area yeah but there 's no specific mention of that area just as the City Council is considering that area it zoning is covered by the e can 't plan like the little support recovery plan determines the land zoning for this area is because of course that overrides our own district plan review chapter that we would naturally have been looking at land zoning for this area through that you know so then that determines the activities that well what the status of the very active various activities are on that land wants the littleton port recovery plan has happened and then like the community board for example of major submission to the long-term plan around boat safety is little Terry you familiar with this there 's a landscape improvement plan for a pass of the area that we 're talking about to the seaward side and obviously the community board and council are very aware of naval points aspirations of a new clubhouse and the work that you 're doing with the Coast Guard and so on so I mean I 'm certainly happy to continue those conversations with you as their local councillor for that area and paula smith as the community board chair probably would be an conversations does anything that does anything that that 's being asked for here is that dependent on the final result of the recovery plan because if it 's not then it 's a separate matter benefit is that 's right i mean most of what 's been raised today is little support recovery plan issues rather than long-term plan issues right okay so but but but once so once the recovery plan is concluded and we have certainty around the use designation or the zoning of the particular area then we would have to make a decision about allocations of funding for whatever that would be is that what you 're saying what we 're saying is it 's quite a tricky area to deal with and we 've got a lot of expertise to offer we 'd like to partner up right and and come to some solution we 're known as we 've got handout we want your support and I went to partner up I pan and we 're totally understand now yeah and that 's a good enough the earthquakes we found that we became the only all the social events all the meetings can be on the Pilates group come down the ladies yo that comes down so we 're running seven days a week quite a nice week when comes a huge amount the sea scouts or affiliated with us for support so we know with the public good yeah and we know we need to find ourselves and we need some support in those areas so what we build there needs to be a community-based book and it 's going to really for the next 50 years ago today its generation so I got together right yep okay right Yanni I mean um I think there 's a financial question as well but I 'm just the land zoning question we 've already made a submission to the building for trickery plane last last week yet that it include this area that 's hatched around not resigning it of the position that we took through our submission was to keep the recreational area as large as it could be and to have the port operation area smaller than was originally proposed in the from where it was that and that 's probably from this on the bug harbor zone so we 've specifically said we don 't want the butter zone thing reduced um yeah the port zone wooden 's impinge on on the boat harbor zone but that whole area would be set a right aside for recreational purposes yeah and then just that um second thing I just wanted to check is um toyota so let 's get money oh oh sorry um I just wonder whether we need to think about meeting with the port giving we find it 100 percent now so with that through CHL or what if there 's another price is not through the poor recovery plan but to work I know that the poor companies really keen on us because they took the chief executive took me for a tour around their area and when I was running for mere so I mean there is a long-standing interest to the port company that this gets resolved at the same time as all the redevelopments happen so I think that an outcome from this presentation could the naval point club and and and and the council so that we can number that we can we can work through the various issues because we want to understand tenure and yep to build a company and and like the Buddha port Camille and we could we 're meeting with Peter Davies shortly all right we could off to buy that but or try and get security of it but at the end of the day there should be owned by the council for perpetuity right and there should be all recreation reserve and we should be a tenant on that yeah and then if you are people around or whatever it that the deal hipster be but you guys the council should hold that and for the greater good of the gated community this ear is so important no no it 's absolutely vital and I don 't think you get any argument from anywhere around the table that 's great just let it stress it wait and get us on the plane excellent least it went on over thank you thank you very much right I will 8 30 tomorrow morning _"

    "text": "james adams crash church youth council i brought a friend so allow me 20 bouquet who 's another hamilton high school student and also on the youth council and thanks to our supporters in the audience and also thank you to the council staff lots of thank yous at the start for the convenient time that it is for us because we can 't submit when it 's during school hours it 's convenient for us but i gather at least so for you because it 's been a very long day overall thank you for the opportunity to speak to our submission on what i 've been told is Christ church 's most important post-quake document I might also comment that I previously been told that the government 's blueprint the land use recovery plan the City Council annual plan a few years back and the original recovery plan were each also the most important post quite document one way or another I 've been involved in all of these plans though not half as much as you people as a thirteen-year-old I start posting notes to Christian boards eagerly watched the videos of how house said he could turn out to be and in recent years I 've submitted to a variety of plans and strategies but now in my last year of high school I 'm keen for a new challenge and so I fully intend to leave Christchurch the end of this year most likely to study a Victoria or Auckland University the question remains is you know what 's going to make people like me want to come back or as was articulated at one of the community engagement meetings christchurch in 20-25 should I stay or should I go Christ Church for a very long time in the future is going to be the place that 's rebuilding from the earthquakes and what happens in the next ten years could very well determine what Christ Church will be like for generations to come which brings me nicely to the long-term plan which sets out the council 's priorities for the next ten years when we discussed the long-term plan as a recent youth council meeting the biggest reaction we got was here we go survey in which we asked a variety of questions about what people thought about the state of the rebuild and what they thought money should be spent on it always comes back to the money interestingly enough and it would be a good point now to point out that I know very little about the complex nature of the City Council 's financial situation and neither do i assume do the majority of young people who answered our survey they did all however agree with Jamie goths statement that quote when you 're dealing with a 1.2 billion dollar shortfall you 're not going to do that by tinkering around the religious and so the position of the crisis youth council is based on the information that we do have is that young people generally support the measures proposed in this plan to manage the City Council 's finances over the last over the next ten years fetters we support some asset sales but not too many and we support the rates being raised but not by too much however we did think that there was quite a lot of on its expenditure we 're eager to see how the council can do more with less as the phrase goes we especially don 't want to see cuts being placed on the services that the council provides especially the libraries the swimming pools and the recreation centers which are well used by young people or to the community grant funding that helps the not-for-profit sector like ourselves keep our head above the water is no doubt you 've been being told the NGOs play a crucial role in our communities and the City Council will only find more problems for itself if it tries to cut or you know unnecessarily rejiggered funding in this area whatever our government might think we think the council still has a responsibility of promoting the social economic environmental and cultural well-being of our communities now and into the future one thing that young people are a little bit less convinced about is spending money money on the infamous stadium in convention center which in our survey few people said they would actually use and many people that I 've spoken to evine aghast at Cathedral Square incidentally our central square it 's quite a nice place to visit when it 's sunny there are buskers a few but not too many food vendors tourists taking photos left right and center and quite a few people just going about their daily business this is the sort of city that people want not imposing structures that we task or thank you very much and if you 'd like to take that message to sarah ccd you or minister Branly you 'd have the youth councils full support something that we 'd really like you to prioritize is open cycle ways and other proposals for making public and active transport safer and more popular we thank you for taking heed of the public outcry when people were told that the cycleways program was going to take longer than anticipate and committing to continuing with the project that 's good whether it 's flat topography parks and already high numbers of cyclists christchurch is perfectly positioned to be a cycling capital and that would make me want to come back we also think you should prioritize more bus heavily used by cyclists and people with mobility issues and kids with scooters but in the end I think it comes down to trust people tend to be busy with their own lives and young people are no exception to this we don 't have the time or the expertise to get to grips with the tricky situation that the Cassetti council isn 't but we want to trust you we want to trust you to keep us informed but not overwhelm us with information we want to trust you to work together but not to stifle debate we want to trust you to make the case for a more human scale rebuild to the government and we want you to we want to trust you to do the best for those in our community who need support in generally supporting the long-term plan the youth council cast the budget trust but we 're still interested in came to be part of the process we wish you the best of luck in the difficult decisions before you and thank you again there 's an awesome submission I 'd hear ya and I mean it 's always just a critical breath of fresh air to ear comments like that but should I stay or should I go can we ask you that now because we don 't want you to go to Victoria University we want you to go to Canterbury um no I am very keen to have a new challenge but I am very open to the idea coming back right on so yeah you get three years and then or however long that takes me ok but so as long as with a cycle capital at the of the country and but but I mean you 've asked you 've seen more than that but but I like the way that you just simply said that we 're here to bet you make hard decisions but we want to be part of that so it 's not like abandoning us to to make these decisions on our own but just the offerors that you want to work with us yeah yeah Paul two things we made their earlier on that 's a good thing the second thing is year she wanted to combine to your home sex snack many a degree here in cottage yeah um yeah Ellie who 's staying Oh saying it I 'm not that old Rex mangie no I don 't know this on the clash okay so every time you say that most of us around this table here at and our kids oh really oh ok I 'd know I thought it was a nice phrase but I no idea was a song yeah yeah no look um I think that I mean you 've put some challenging she 's in front of us i mean i thought it i mean i like the fact that your submission had all of these sort of meteor shoes and then it was bring forward the repair barrington place i know i don 't see issue yeah very important i know i 'm sure this is the thing this is the thing that when we when we look at and i think in a way you 've highlighted it that when you when when you 're dealing with a long-term plan there are individual communities an opportunity to come along and express support for those and we have to balance them all up and you know I just thought your submission really nailed that point and the inclusion of the barrington playground just emphasized the fact that we 've got our own with our own communities to worry about at the same time as thinking about the city as a whole yep Oh fantastic pixel no one correct okay well thank you very much so cool thank you and um lucky last David Henderson _"

    "text": "hey I 'm really sorry about the delay and I actually have something that started at five beauty but I 'll stay but yeah I 'm not going to make it i don 't think i have enjoyed listening actually in we 're often confused with neighborhood support so it 's quite funny that they 're just before us and and actually been working with dave and an emergency response plan for the northeast christchurch area so as a neighborhood trust we are working and the Schilling Mariko area and but we do work with a lot of different organizations so a very collaborative group we were part of a eight clusters and the northern part of Christchurch that was set up by MST we 're part of the network and surely we part of the link we can Peppa no II we 're part of a connecting group new group which is across the city we run parenting week every second year was about a hundred other organizations on board for that so although we focused in a particular area we do actually work across the city and have so thank you very much for allowing me to have this time and I believe that the council has got very good people and that when I see the things about what you 're doing good brains good hearts and I do give us speak for stepping up and a leadership at such a time as this I would not have your job for anything I think mine stressful but yours is fun although so my comments well they might seem negative in some ways actually around how we work better together and they 're also around making sure that are more vulnerable members of our community actually have a say and here for chance so my submission is on three different areas and I 'll just try to really briefly of these those so the first one was around are consumed on the process around the changes to the funding rounds you 've probably had a horde of submissions around it so I can soon as that in your own documents it states a statement from the community outcomes section page 89 and also the public participation and community thousand and fourteen states decisions are transparent and informed by timely accurate and robust all information or advice and decisions take account of community views i feel this didn 't actually happen in terms of the the changes to the funding and i 'm sure it wasn 't intentional but the impact on groups was actually huge and to actually go on to the council website really to submit an application in to see which funding mound will not open until the ltp and budget has been said actually lifts us not knowing what was happening at all and several people in our class terrain council and got three different actual time frames one was told three months almost told six months one was saying it may not happen at all so there was a lot of anxiety for us as groups and I know civil organizations who actually cancelled the plans Quetzal ravines simply because they didn 't know what was happening and then when it did open it said that small grant grants land was to be abolished and wouldn 't be being anymore now that was a we see that the recommendation bacon and november of last year was that the council would actually have a series war funding rounds and more focused more more responsive and more specific and yet taking out these small grants so i 'm wondering why that was what there 's been no nothing on the website about why that decision was actually made and so it would be really good to have some feedback on that and the other thing that I 'd like to ask is there were the funds of 790 5257 allocated for small grants we are a set going to as it going to the strengthening communities fund or as it going to the discretion grants or as it a head and reduction and fan available to our community groups so there 's a question that I have and would be really interested to hear a response on okay so your small grants and your big cracks all come together yeah and is there a reason for that when the recommendation was four more rounds and smaller we can have Susan four more rounds no problem but off that was fairly arbitrary and so if you want six or seven thousand where do you go you want 4900 where do you go so it was just an ease of operation basically it wasn 't intended to reduce or any of those things in fact quite the opposite the purpose of the changes was to make it possible for groups to apply for longer periods of time so you don 't have to spend your whole life applying for grants and not having certainty about it so it was intended to make it as easy as possible for community groups not having come from a local government background that I was introduced to the concept of making significant changes through activity management plans last year for the first time and it 's not a process that I agree with and it is something that will change but that 's right there is there isn 't a reduction the two percent reduction that was implied wasn 't error yeah but you 're right that there should all remember there should have been a communication so there 's a communication prior engagement one which is activity management plan shouldn 't be used to make major changes that haven 't been consulted with community groups thank you and the second submission was around public participation and community and city governments and and what I was reading is that that the the policy is to reduce printed media which is understand and increase digital media to be cost effective but while this is understandable and the community in which we work thirty-three percent of the population do not have internet access and so I 'm wondering would the council consider having free Wi-Fi and targeted community hubs in those areas that have a very low uptake uptake of Anton eat if most of the information is going to be presented and a digital format and I mean you can 't even put on your tax return without going online now you know and if you 're a business and you want to work out what you cost say you need to go online to our do and put their phone to get it big and if you do not have access to to actually put in for an application to work and income you also need to do that online and it 's becoming very difficult to negotiate the world without internet access I know libraries have it but if you go on to a library you 'll see that they are fully occupied every single computer Thea is fully occupied and of reducing the minutes that you can spend on that now so by the time you 've actually found something and work your way around it if you 're not familiar with actually using the internet you probably have to golf the machine so what we 're saying is that there are quite a few community hubs around the place places where people could actually get some of that help from a staff member as well around negotiating those sites would the capsule perhaps consider targeted free Wi-Fi in those places I don 't think it 's Wi-Fi that you 're talking about you 're talking about exes to the Internet no no but it you are you saying that people have got the hardware at home but they can their phones now inside you so so if you plug into a Wi-Fi hotspot then you can use your phone to negotiate this all our libraries have got what free Wi-Fi and so is our council buildings all about council buildings here it 's just about locating them and the areas we know but we 've got free why fire and all of our buildings you 're asking for free Wi-Fi Wi-Fi we had free Wi-Fi in all our buildings no no but we 're sorry I 'm I 'm queering are we talking about access to the internet which is not necessarily why fights a computer that you can be on for a while with obviously some guidance from people who can help you negotiate websites that you may be unfamiliar with like I rd or are you talking about free Wi-Fi fine because when I said it was the former you said it was the letter and I 'm saying that we love our buildings exactly why this we 've got free Wi-Fi in here yes yes I think also the thing is that the areas in which got low transport ability and so having having more of those areas available we 've got a little place for example on that CF we 're looking at and we 're and that 's the evan it 's ok yeah so we 're looking at free Wi-Fi but we 're also looking at internet access through so it 's actually both yeah and which is why it 's probably confusing in the Maya portage yes yes no no I understand but we also yet we had a visit before from citizens advice and they kind of indicated that they 'd like space and all of our libraries you know which i think is a perfect monks and and maybe it 's it 's through that that we actually need to have dedicated computer time for people who want to use it for that service provision because I suspect the ones that are using it more generally in the libraries are using it for research purposes hmm advanced that an excellent idea to have some dedicated staff to work with them yeah the third third part was really about the the in the long term plan I see them as future ratepayers there but I find it very hard if I look at a six-year-old to consider them as a future right there I 'm just wondering what consult consultation into what what kind of what kind of engagement with children has occurred to actually look at you know most of you probably have children grandchildren lots lots of futures that are looking like through their lenses and how do we engage them and that process and we had at our Mario community day recently we did a survey and about half the people who responded with children and what they talked about was the fact that they had no way to ride their scooters they could not scooter to school because the pavements are broken and I look at the long-term plan and I see and I know it 's huge and I realize it I know that and when I look at it and I see 20 20 30 50 years to repair some back streets I 'm wondering we 've got generations of children growing up and they a lot of the results of that and the anxiety and you know we need to talk to her children and they say that they 'd like more flowers and a live in your old boy who said I 'd like more roses shouldn 't our children have more roses and shouldn 't they have streets with a keen scooter and I 'm wondering if there could be a prioritizing offered peers of the foot pads around schools say 1.5 around schools cuz it 's walking distance isn 't it you know I can walk 1.5 really easy in a world so other people can and also around doctors surgeries you know if you look at with ease and over 65s units and the air and lives down the road there 's a doctors surgery could we not prioritize those places so that our kids can scooters or school they can bank to school so no point putting on cycleways of children kartli and to ride their bikes because there 's no way safer on their own backyard to actually ride and I 'm all for cycleways don 't get there a way that we can do this that we can prioritize it and and make sure that our kids have somewhere that 's not broken because this is what 's coming through to me all the time from them they 'll worried about it that 's saying they 're worried about their houses are worried about their streets in the word that they don 't have any way to chill out that 's what they were telling me they would love to have a BBQ in the park until I 'd love to have places where they had a cupboard playground where they could play and I think we actually owe it to our kitties you know back early in the 2000s and cats are but you will know this we had an international reputation is a child friendly city and I 'd love to see as heavy again oh good I 'm Yanni yeah sorry I just say that we have actually through the cheap committee asked for a report back on how we can become more child-friendly again so we 're expecting that in Joan and I a copy of that report I mean might like to come to the great look thank you very much we appreciate your time and thank you very much again for waiting so long thank you but I 'm glad that you 've enjoyed the other submissions yes thank you _"

    "text": "Linda come forward you too many interesting submissions thank you your worship and counselors I 'm Dave Wilkinson I 'm the manager of an able to support and you obviously know Glenda she 's our office manager she keeps me under control no a bit I 've got some extra information here for the counselors the favored lots will be distributed I 'm first and foremost and it 's fairly obvious we need to thank the council for their continued support over over the years as labour supporters a standalone organisation a bit of brief history lesson for those newer people around that the council chambers neighborhood support was first started in nineteen seventy nine as neighborhood watch by the police and it was set up as a result of a rather severe crime against an old lady in Auckland it remained a police function until 2000 during the time between it was set up and when it was sort of put outside the police I changed the name to neighborhood support because the neighbors were too busy watching each other not supporting each other so the name support came place and had to become a standalone organization in Contra be contra been able to support incorporated was set up and Glenda was involved in part of that i 'm just going to speak briefly about what our submission is but before i do that I 've had an interesting seminar has been yesterday with dr. Rob Gordon from he 's been working with the bushfire people in Australia and there um people here in contra be and he said basically building this city is not just about buildings and infrastructures it 's also about people that 's where we coming from yep we 're building stronger neighborhoods and it 's all about neighbors helping neighbors can to been able to support before September 's and after febrile earthquake we had something like 2,000 neighborhood support groups and that 's dropped down to over about 1,200 we 've lost over 700 neighbored support groups in the red zone so that 's a big chunk of people that are unfortunately for us have moved north of the Y Mackel out to someone but having said that we 're in a rebuilding look at what we do do best and we 're in rebuild mode again some of our areas we 're still working with our the port hills because there 's areas up there is still a bit of a state of flux as houses are being rebuilt and repaired and we 're gradually working away from getting those groups back online and also in the new subdivision like Wigram skies we 've got new groups as well the council chinna be interested in that one of the things we do as an organization we 're involved in quite a number of things outside of just crime prevention one of the things I 'm involved with us enabled placing teams in both Phillipstown and rekelen and along with those two projects is the safe growth in safer communities some projects as well and that 's borne fruit it 's been been a positive to see I 'm also involved with the family violence preventive collaborative so that we 're getting messages out through our network and also through our magazines to those families that being at being done hard whether it being working closely with Sarah over the last four years community groups I 'm involved with safer Christchurch the graffiti office and community patrols as well we 're looking at some vests from a point of view that one of those documents we provided was the review of the civil defense emergency management response to the 22nd feber earthquake which is right in the back and one of the things that came out from those those learners gentlemen with that they they said one more emphasis should be placed on label and support in the event of a disaster and as a result of February 's earthquake I worked in the Emergency Operations Center for seven weeks in which case in which time I was matching people skills and resources for those people who had needs that was prior to our new web-based information system which is up and running now we can do that at a drop for hat and some of the counselors around this table would have seen that web web site in action which shows you how powerful it can be on I 've got nothing is going to talk on behalf of Andrea our junior neighborhood Support Coordinator um yeah it 's my privilege to talk about junior neighborhood support but I 'd like to thank you for your time tonight the main focus of our submission as the importance of the community grants and in what that brings to the community and really what we 're trying to say to you is that without the community grant we couldn 't operate and we couldn 't do the things we do which has helped building neighborhoods and bringing putting the glue in the community but while we 're doing that for the community we operate a junior neighborhood support program and schools Andrea our coordinator as is very vibrant and just the loveliest person she 's an ex teacher she 's working in 12 schools across the city and that covers three thousand about 3,000 children and one of the reasons that came about was for those of you have had children that perhaps Vincent got through school in minded the children the attention were the naughty children they got the treats when they were the children who have been good citizens and it 's just a little treat then nominated by the teachers the community other students just to ever Andrea verifies that the informations correct and then the rewarded in front of the whole school assembly probably twice a tomb she 's in both school and all the schools and the children just be a little goody bag with stuff may need from the two-dollar shop in it in a certificate and it 's just encouraging them to be good citizens and these are the children who are going to be your future ratepayers and who are going to be the children who will help the study stuck together so it 's a really important program and we just want to say without your support and I guess the support of other community groups those sorts of programs couldn 't happen and they 're just so vital to the city that the community is well connected thank you thank you very much and I was really grateful to see you raised the question of the underpayment review and to the sort of civil a very long time that we need to find out how to coordinate and integrate the civil defense volunteer network that we have and the neighborhood support which is really a citywide resource in times of emergency but at the rest of the time it 's not focused on an emergency response it 's focused on you know developing networks of support with other communities and that to me is just an ideal mix and I think we could do really really well by taking that recommendation and making it happen I 'll fill in Jimmy look we 're just going to ask you i just whent held that the whole the civil defense part of the event with counsel and they would support how that might also be to a local flood defence spending there are some community groups who have got that under way I think our new is a very good case in point swimming is that really some linkages or is it some potential you live with that part of of our our sort of civil defense no we 've already had we had a training 'sthat run from the community yep summer feel Residents Association and a couple of others the next one I 'm going to be dealing with there 's a North Shore residents association so we 're trying to build those things at grassroots level might be good to have links with the community boards around there too and this is just think of it yep Jimmy one question because I review the yoader report regarding to the our number of Street goofs and also the kind of the different award I am concerned for instant like offended by Mary they have only the 58,000 people for a moment they have the neighbor support over 200 attained by victim we will we have 68 the thousand people only 148 and your particular mention regarding to the new subdivision area you try to say after you know the new the kind of neighborhood support the group but I 'm concerned hot how many numbers Street group on we will skype de la MOLLE the a don 't view this a new subdivision area this is my particular concept very few and I mean there 's one of me to do the field work so unless we get someone prepared to put the hand up in a street to start the ball rolling I don 't have the time to go door knocking and when your door not to set up a group it doesn 't work anyway you 've got to have that natural leader in the street exact to say year pick me so we don 't know whether it 's something we can do with with your community board as is going out into those ears and talking to people yep yeah a very good suggestion look thank you very much that was an excellent submission and I think that 's given us some food for thought as well thank you neighborhood trust for jinniyah Larson _"

    "text": "I know that yep thank you for waiting good afternoon and I know it 's been a long day for you so I 'll be I 'll be brief Andre love it 's my name I 'm here on behalf of the Arts in to trust board we we submitted on three points I just want to talk talk to those points very briefly the context for us is that at the Art Center we we need the city to be successful and and the city needs us to be successful so we are overwhelmingly understanding and positive about about what you 're trying to do in terms of this plan firstly point one in relation to heritage funding and we acknowledge and support the efforts of the council to ensure that funding is available to owners of heritage assets we personally have been or as a trust has had benefited from the council hereish funding that has been in place for owners over a number of years we note that there is downward pressure on those funds and and now perspective we now we 're smart enough to know big thing for us is that you 're continuing to do it and I think that 's fantastic second thing about arts culture and creative industries I want to acknowledge the good work that council staff has been doing particularly around conversations about sustainable business models with organizations that come to you and seek funds our observation is that there are still lots and lots of arts based organizations who operate on the basis of an annual grant cycle and and are working hard to try and break out of that but it 's for us it 's a comp it 's a conversation about time frames some of them need a little bit longer to get it and get on their feet and and also some of them need to and that their funding is at risk i think if they if they don 't actually change the way that outbreak expectations are really really really high on that sector and you know that finally we are in a fantastic part of the city a great neighborhood that that by the end of this year is going to be art center is going to be open we 've got the gardens we 've got the museum we 've got the gallery and other things in 2013 when we went through a process to really challenge and look at the vision the vision for the Art Center in the future one of the key points that came out of that was the value of the cultural precinct it 's a conversation that we 've sought to start with council staff we we will continue to it sorry not just council staff but our immediate neighbors we are strongly pushing for that and and the council was obviously an important member of that grouping I think it it will it will yield greater opportunities and what it did prior to the earthquakes because of what 's going on in our neighborhood that 's it happy to take questions brilliant well let me start by saying I just you you bring joy to my life every day I look out my window and see the progress and I just think even that we weren 't your insurers so the benefit that benefits see the fruits of it every day and I just say congratulations i watch I take international visitors out and show them the biggest historic you know sort of heritage restoration project that the country 's ever seen and and in they are impressed I 'm impressed and I can 't wait till it 's all reopened I 've got a completely vested interest because I got married there so but you know well done we just incredibly impressed and also for your engagement with the wider community uh I was invited to be part of that is just a ordinary citizen of the city and I felt that you were very outreaching and inclusive and your engagement and I think that 's why you where you 're at and your status and the community reflects that so Ali thank you I mean I lived there above the Ducks deluxe and regularly flooded the Ducks deluxe I 'm living upstairs rooms my first job at the court theatre and I was walking down there today into the into the garden through to the ilex and i looked back at that stunning and i did when i looked at the amazing Gardens as you 've just said to look back at the building what 's happening there now could probably never ever have been contemplated all done and you know i 'm not suggesting why I suppose I am it as a good thing to have come out of the quakes but I just can 't wait to see it i can again it 's amazing me too um Becky you actually tell us please what does open doing so at the moment we 've got nine buildings under way there 's 110 million dollars of construction underway right now that 's out of a 290 million dollar program and twenty two buildings to fix up we have eight buildings opening by the end of this year that includes the college or Great Hall all of the clock tower that the buildings in a northwest corner of the site effectively the chemistry building which faces the South quadrangles the library the arcades that wrap around it and the boys high building which sits in the eastern part of the site near gymnasium and the registry editions hmm no no I mean this is I know want to know which part of it is the university taking up university classics and music 's going to be in chemistry chemistry anticipo lane the museum is using stata you sometimes they 're amazing they 're going to be moving in the in some not easy but I think I know we are we are in a discussion about potentially an iconic attraction a Christchurch right iconic attraction with with a number of parties including the museum and that the engineering buildings as we were actually looking at that that 's part of the philosophy around the visitor experience christchurch requiring two or three truly iconic and and christchurch-based attractions okay and when you 're thinking about that that building is not completed until the end of next year and you know it 's incredibly conceptual idea great well let 's go start some way mm-hmm excellent Thank You Ellie can have a smidgen hey what if you have you found anything really odd I mean obviously it 's very old building no I just your family we there weren 't any foundation size of the great at all I don 't_''_448.8 some beer bottles lots of beer bottles is really under the university right people they all this this there 's a lot happy to I mean we 've got it we got a tumblr site that has a lot of that stuff on a happy offline happy to talk to you about it yeah so it looked at there hasn 't been archaeological artifacts of quite the backstory that that some of the new Regent Street stuff have had the most interesting I think it has been the graffiti the stuff that 's on behind you know 1870 timber work for example and messages and not nice areas rather said right Aneesa but you were some money Martin oh yeah so there is neat stuff right um yeah knee I 'm just cuz i 'm on the arts in a trust board can I just ever recorded as you know stood back from the discussion oh okay I 'm not sure what you mean by up lighting up lighting so that it 's speed excellent yeah we what we want to say I mean when you when we get to talk about Ian deuces on the side we 're interested in activity right through the the daytime and nighttime cycle and certainly people coming to that part of town to visit the gardens and the evening is consistent with that yeah great look Thank You Andre thanks for waiting to Canterbury neighborhood support glenda furch _"

    "text": "he will saw my last videos won 't where I 'm jury tell me what place what 's me all right off you go so i have to give apologies on behalf of counselor Goff that we are running late so i do apologize to everyone well mm-hmm I 've got two apologies as well from our twist right thank you sorry I think I 'm with the trouble is that because we 've got 600 submissions to here we give individuals five minutes and organizations 10 minutes but if you can 't you can 't just have people in front of you for that amount of time but so we 're just going to have to look at how we structure the rest of the rest of the week yeah I understand the process hmm at the time so thank you here and anything you counsel for taking time to listen to my presentation I 'm representing out for his Christchurch and just so you 're aware AdWords Christchurch 's an advocacy agency for the parts and christchurch has been central to the rebuild and we 're a mixture we did a survey on the arts in christchurch we surveyed 500 people working in the arts involved in the arts and from its survey much of what i 'm going to just summarize and go through came from that so this is professionals working in the arts at a really high level but also people coming out of art schools amateur art groups of Secrets that 's intended to be all encompassing so just the first image di just put a list of who arts for it says so you 'll probably know all these people of Neal Cotts the Isaac theatre myself founded the James 241 studios and galleries and have done other arts projects so it 's a visual arts performing arts Adam Hayward director of the body festival so Adam has given his apologies they can 't_''_131.039 be here unfortunately Deborah mcCormick director escape his also put in apologies Melanie Oliver from the physics room account director Madden trust on his now project manner manager 4020 tu carro at by the river and loot to soma the musical director of them court theatre christchurch Chautauqua so we are representing the voice of the Arts and Christchurch what I wanted to talk about was just to emphasize really the first recommendation that we 've put forward for the long term plan and the importance of that in the sense that the delivery of that really will lead to the and I think the successful outcome for the other recommendations that we have so I 'm going to talk generally about that then I had some images of an arts project that took place late last year in Christchurch which was highly successful and I think really shows exactly where the arts are at the moment they 've changed significantly over the last four years in fact profoundly really and so and then I 'll just finish with a very short summary so first of all the recommendation arts were as strongly urges the Christchurch City Council to prioritize and develop an active activity management plan for the Arts and this is to ensure the best outcomes through through a unified management plan that will nurture videos of resources for the Arts was the council and provide shape I mean I see the activity management plan and implementation of that for the Arts is really a way in which that will actually start to develop grow and make a significant benefit to the Arts in there delivering the city looking at long and short tune priorities so it will contribute to a more efficient administration of the arts and arts organizations and events that the christchurch city counts are involved in and it 's essential to the delivery of successful outcomes for all of our tours Christchurch 's recommendations to the city council plan and industry briefly those are collaborative planning between arts organizations sharing resources essentially a bit of use of existing resources prioritizing young artists and graduate 02 in christchurch to things like developing relationships between the arts and businesses giving opportunities to graduates because they do continue to leave the study that soon he came through from the survey for them to be part of the rebuild to reap the benefits of the rebuilders artists designers and and creative thinkers their skills and knowledge also can be broader not just to festivals and events that services of the city council operate as well and the other recommendation was addressing the issue around facilities and for the Arts at the moment that came through very strongly from the survey last year as of real concern the underlying the key fact that came through really was all arts organizations are still concerned after four years about the lack of good facilities or any facilities at all for the out so enabling progress on the Performing Arts Center arts precinct and reviewing existing and potential facilities for the Arts so those recommendations that I 've just mentioned I really I see them as being very much part of a much broader infrastructure and one that would be you know successfully entered implemented through an activity management plan for the Arts we are the second largest city in New Zealand and we 're it surprising we don 't actually have a comprehensive art strategy there is a strategy but i think it 's 2002 2003 maybe a little later but it 's a it 's a very was outdated in and essentially the city continues to operate without a the moment because in 2015 the arts are a key contributor to revitalizing the century city with new spaces events and festivals and you will be aware though it 's not mentioned those in the submission as well it 's not just the inner city that 's changed it 's also the Arts in the city as well so very briefly what 's happened to the arts over the last four years is that you now have a far more diverse and inclusive range of arts activities there are new galleries new performances new events there 's a development of working relationships between arts organizations they are really starting to share resources and with good outcomes the arts have extended their presence under more public and privately owned spaces in fact in the city 's history the arts have never been so visible and you all know that you will have all experienced that too they represented in music by more choirs in the city than it 's ever had orchestras greater musical activity this is Luke to Simon 's claim of takers word is that Christ Church is the 's also seen more people in the arts were involved in the arts and Christchurch but the public in general participating in dance as a recreational activity there are stacks on that as well and overall the arts been characterized by very inventive and strong do attitude over the last four years finally they provide very good reasons key reasons in fact for people to come into the inner city and re-engage with that in meaningful ways I 've been involved in I 've gone through that I 've been involved in sitting up first thursdays in certain which as a an arts event encamping music performance exhibitions for one night and it takes place three times a year first one was held on the second of October and we 've I 've done a survey on that and also the following on we held in febri this year the next one 's in June but I do have some stats to give you just to give you a sense of how we see the arts working so i 'll run these pictures so we had an estimated five and thursdays on october last year forty percent were in or around signum in fifty five percent were from the wider part of christchurch so that event attracted people than to understand them for a night out fifty-eight percent identified the highlight of the evening is actually being in sudden the bus were being near the enjoyment of the city the cafe 's a good food and exploring the precinct and that was a real success for the arts because the arts were there they were the thing that drew the men but it was great to see that those community outcomes and you could actually see them going if you were there going through the street people were having a great evening thirty-two percent did identify the highlighters artworks live music pop-up exhibitions we also ran out to us and I think this was really interesting ninety-four percent of those that went to the first said they were moderate visitors to certain them or occasional or not at all so you know in terms of the way in which that event acted to reintroduce people in Christ it 's to significant but an estimated spend of 85,000 in the evening with a deeper see a December send loads of tending purchasing something and talking to the retailers I think that 's a fairly it 's a that 's a relatively accurate figure there 's just some comments we also interviewed people what they thought of it they overwhelmingly positive i think it was ninety-nine percent so we had some of that was amazing i 'll be there every time a wonderful event for christchurch and suddenly my hope it will inspire other events like this across christchurch Matt continue and grow great evening and so need to see the streets are buzzing people out and enjoying the city happy faces families young folk appreciating our music brilliant can 't_''_587.91 wait till next time and the last one this was from the most recent one we ran in February first those days was one of those very special things happening around christchurch absolutely fantastic so that that person put both those exclamation marks and not me sorry ah it 's the fourth of june and it will be our five and n roll and so we have you know there 's the evidence of the way in which there 's a lot of collaboration going on between the various arts organizations for that event a lot of goodwill and a very much of public art out on the street event i mean is the really interesting development in the arts but i think you know could form part of it an important part of a strategy the other thing i wanted to mention to us that last year the earth was made a presentation to communities Housing and Economic Development Committee on the fourth of December and that was to report on the strategy which I 've referred to from that meeting a recommendation was made by the committee and the recommendations of the minutes to ensure that the arts continue to proactively contribute to the rebuild of Christchurch and connect meaningfully with our community we accept the art for its offer to work with the council central government and others to make these things happen in a proactive way the combined strategy advocacy funding and continued support for action so there is also an expression of commitment to from the council that I wanted to mention so I mean I feel really confident to state the recommendations and hearts for its crushed your submission they 're made with the best interest of residents and the council and the arts of had so I urged the council to prioritize and develop an active activity management plan for the arts as being the first step towards achieving more efficient and even better delivery of outcomes to the city by all arts organizations with the best use of resources and definitely through the best strategies it 's a little known fact but with restart and part of the success of restart i have to say i want to say publicly is that later conversation with deborah mccormick 's which then led a little conversation with Warren and Chris Herbert and we set up a thing called up eight minute which was highly successful and it showed the integration between the arts and business is so critical to which create a really cool environment where people come along and actually be surprised and the said that off and about part of the success or free start or through the collaboration with the US that 's voice and i just want to say that publicly in and i think what you 're doing here is great and i just think there 's a council we need to think about how we work with them to actually achieve more good results and maybe in other areas like New Brighton like some and other areas littleton how we can actually integrate this rots rip the fabric of our city this so i just very quickly this project first says days is actually bit evolved from out beat so the people that were working on artbeat other stone one of them the same people that have been involved with this one thank you turnover of young people in the city is affecting if at all the gross and being able to sustain the arts sector I mean after 45 years it 's everyone 's still tired but you need that youth and early what do you think um it 's we don 't have stats on that but that did come through that artist young people are leaving Christchurch and I know I had 18 months working in Wellington 2012 2013 a number of artists I knew from Christchurch moved up and I ran into them but it just by word of mouth like you some what I could see us um years I young artists are leaving and they 're still living and that was something expressed by a number of people from outsource to I mean Luke to Simon terms of music that was one of his concerns I know yeah I bet but is it as it is a still a reality yeah I mean it 's important to fight that and retain people and I think the interesting thing with this project is that it actually it 's being really curated put together by recent graduates from Canterbury so there 's some yeah but it is forming tell thanks for in 15 seconds I hope and look thank you and I 'm just one like it 's just the program project is just done so much for setting and I 'm just thinking after yours it may be a bit short of some part of the funding not encouraging double dipping back there Europe and have you approached the community building event of needing some extra funding for another part of that probably no no not at the moment no but thank thank you today we 're actually looking we 've got I had a good meeting today with interest from can 't_''_911.37 say who but got good interest outside centralized of government resources that the next one 's way thank you very much thanks can I go just comment on that that just that what you 've been saying around the need for an art strategy or plan and you know like its own activity management plan although hinge the idea of any activity pension plan but that 's for another reason but the idea of having a kind of a review of of policy and an overarching way I mean I want to look at the whole yeah decision-making framework around us so we 've got the community funding grants we 're kind of looking at them and how do we get across different funders etc etc and what I 'm kind of feeling here though is more of a more of a strategic approach so maybe maybe I mean and I know that Phil mentioned this before about having a group you know made up of counselors arts representatives and and arts advisors within the council to try and get a holistic and joined up decision-making framework as well so so I want to kind of take that offline and and and say that we want to address that enough in a very real way but it won 't necessarily be as part of the ltp process button the next next iteration of where we go yeah i mean what just describing it was what was proposed and in that recommendation of the simba really about good conversations discussion with good information coming through about how best to proceed with the strategy for the arts yeah i thought we had a briefing the other day from sarah on the project that mountains and both done you know which you know i have to say that I sit there and listen to Recovery Authority creating another vehicle for something that we already do as a city so so I 've started that conversation with them because to me I think that there are there are insufficient you know sort of minutes in a day and and hours and a week for another structure to be set up and then for them to look for a way of integrating it and to what 's already existing as part of this transition and I 'd rather cut that off at the pass and find a way through that I can think of that look I won 't_''_1078.2 but just one final comment on that and that is that working in the arts and had this discussion with a lot of people it 's really interesting because you 've got his big players you know just thinking of Sarah yeah in fact artists and people working out steam to operate between all these different levels they 'll be working at an artist-run space which is run on virtually nothing and then they 'll also be involved in projects and you know it 's a very in the outside all of it feeds on to the outcomes are lots of different levels exactly oh yeah thank you very much thanks um Andre I 'm really sorry you know I 'm sorry to everyone that has taken a lot longer _"

nothing Roman my hi Gary I also have some additional information if you guys would like black that as well yes that 'll be great somebody will come down and get it cheers thanks everyone for stickin n Leah um so I 'm Amy Hartnell I 'm talking on behalf of the earthquake disability leadership group or an advocacy group advocating for a more accessible crashed church with the rebuild a few weeks ago as a group we undertook an exercise to reconfirm our vision in key messages and they are actually on the back of the document that you 've been handed out one of the Christians we were asked successful as an advocacy group what will Christchurch look like in 20-25 our future Christchurch is a built environment that people of all abilities can use safely and with ease and by built environment we include buildings public space ways public spaces in pathway connections we see disabled people and employment in being generators of wealth we see disabled people as customers and consumers we see disabled people being able to visit the city as tourists we see opportunities to participate in decision making and that society has the capacity to integrate disabled people into the fabric of the city so back to 2015 how do we make that vision happen it goes without saying that christ church is currently in a fairly unique possession The Canterbury earthquakes have given this city the opportunity to remove one of the major barriers for disabled people to participate in the community and there is physical access as a group we 're really excited about the talk around accessibility it 's strongly identified in this year and idea initiatives the concept appears and recovery recovery plans and it has been said that Christchurch daqui payers really know how to achieve that and do they know what they 're actually looks like one of our major concerns that the current building code and standards design practices and construction methods are still lagging behind in creating what we would call a genuinely accessible built environment the current building code still allows a compliant accessible route be one which is separate or segregated from the one that family and friends would use such as the front entrance it still makes compliant that there needs to be only one accessible entrance way but what about the other issues such as how person finds the building or able to use the building once they 're inside to achieve a task there is also the thinking that accessibility means only considerations for wheelchair users without functionality for those with sensory impairments intellectual disabilities and one of our older adults families with children even visitors to the city are other consumers that current policy makers have a differing on what an accessible city is or means just to be clear is not our view than an accessible City means a plan states that the redevelopment of Christchurch provides a significant opportunity to address accessibility the building 's open spaces and facilities that people visit work and live and need to be safe accessible and people-friendly the long-term plan also makes statements and its community outcomes such as people have equitable access to parks open spaces recreation facilities and libraries and that the central city is used by a wide range of people for an increasing range of activities our question to you is what does Christchurch 2025 look like to you if these outcomes have been achieved how will you know if they 've been achieved and what is the accountability for ensuring that occurs bringing it back to our submission and our first topic was strengthening our community so that his heritage and housing the council has a lot of work to undertake in its own backyard and terms of repairing and rebuilding community facilities recreation facilities public spaces and anchor projects our question to you is what is your commitment to ensuring these facilities are going to be genuinely accessible to its citizens what policies strategies regulations are and following on from that when projects are contracted out or carried out in partnership with other agencies or other arms of the council such as the new development Christchurch will the commitment to use this practice accessible design be part of the mandate for that project our other topic was public transport and sac away the built environment is not the only element to consider in creating a genuinely accessible Christchurch the journey to and from a destination is just as important am I able to find and get to my destination safely and with ease in terms of public transport these elements include the pathway to the bus stop the bus stop itself the buses kessinger lounges supply of information regarding routes and timetables creating a safe accessible useable public transport journey functions well for disabled people older adults parents with children visitors in tourists the city the other area and the topic is cycleways there has been a lot of media on the topic of psycho ways in reformatting the city to encourage residents to cycle or use public transport there are currently three transport proposals seeking off the road and into a shield pathway situation with pedestrians the cyclists have gone from being the vulnerable element on the road to the hazard on the footpath pedestrians with sensory impairments older adults parents with young children had now become the vulnerable group at risk of collision when cyclers are coming past in both directions at speed the shared pathway model is one example of not using best practice accessibility design methods so what needs to happen what are our suggestions and what is our feedback accessibility as enhanced when local and national stakeholders and community have a joint and clear understanding of what it means we all need to be on the same page then accessibility needs to be integrated into all levels of decision-making planning and design regulations and policy need to be implemented in order to achieve a genuinely accessible setting currently the building act building code in New Zealand standard 4121 still do not provide the appropriate level of regulations and leave this legislation to ensure that it occurs however they are currently under review and we fully support the long-term goal of achieving current opportunity provided in Christchurch will be missed if we do not take our own initiative to make our own changes first and foremost would like the commitment from the council that best practice accessibility design as a priority for all of its own facilities public spaces and anchor projects we would like that commitment shown through policy and highlighted and planning processes the CCD you avin river project team utilized a great process of working with the experts in order to achieve their project met the accessible needs of the public their model provides a great example of how consultation at every critical stage of design and construction can achieve the desired outcome a genuinely accessible public space secondly we have a proposal currently sitting with the minister of disability issues that we 'd like the council to support this involves taking a local measure to implement a mandatory and dependent accessibility audit of all commercial and public buildings in open spaces we understand this action requires no change to legislation and as being recommended by the consent sector we 're confident of the benefits of an accessibility audit and inspection process but also to increase the understanding knowledge and awareness of architects designers and developers and I 've handed out a copy of the proposal that 's sitting with the minister to sum up the edl g we have confidence that we all want to study to be inclusive to all people the question is are you willing to make that happen thanks Candida we are certainly willing to make if I wanted to happen yeah the young boy I was just checking my the name of that but but we use the life Mac standard on our own buildings but we can 't well we 've tried to include that in our district plans so I hope that you are making submissions on the on the district plan review because if it doesn 't survive that then we won 't be able to have it enforced so life marks are standard for residential houses I know but that 's what we 've that 's what we will want to achieve you say I know that I know it 's not it 's only one element of it 've actually had really good information from people within Council and counselors that you have that commitment to doing laughs mark for housing and we 're the wheeling holy prelate everyone to build their way yes yeah it 's not just the council how long that 's got to partnership ok so so for the district plan we would like to achieve six star in the green star i 'm home star rating and in the light mark as well such that any new houses built actually meeting those standards we are struggling getting that through so what we 're trying to suggest to you is there just may learn to just ever so gently is that we 've left it in but it is that is slightly found out it could be long about you and your value just support our initiative or any mandatory excessively addressed and i like the way you doing his work right I 'm septum and Phil and Yanni i 'm not sure if you did you see the presentation made by those that wanted the boardwalk or the promenade sorry and you guys one of the standards that I want is that it 's accessible for all including disabled so that 's one of the standards that are sitting for that project so I 'm presuming their great support roller their productivity and like with our submission we make it really clear that there are experts in terms of accessible design in all we 're really asking is that the experts are consulted barrier-free line foundation CCS they all provide a really good auditing service and they do have the technical expertise so it would be our mandate that you consult the experts with all projects and just get and just get the expert advice as you would with any other project yeah as long as they 've got that as part of the building process and planning process and design process then we would be really supportive of that oh thank you i just wondered if don 't date day wise and when it comes to parking for people with disabilities around the accessibility of their particularly probably in relation to where council facilities like tea leaves post-earthquake has been some disruption our organization to comment you know on accessible parking for people with disabilities Oh probably CCS we do satirical they are plugged up oh please mobility black skin dude Papa the world hey listen your kid you Peggy yep so they also distribute the parking passes and so they would have a really good idea of all the mobility parking around the city what I 've lost and what 's currently in place oh yeah probably get you the cooler you yeah so they would hear all the feedback from the public so CC is support be the conduit between you and them yeah it 's great Oh Yanni I just wanted to check if you 've been involved at all what the memorial earthquake other ok memorial design initially from the drawings I saw it was really obvious that they hadn 't been much consideration and there 's been a lot more work done on it has just been announced today it 's just being announced today yeah we did do a submission for that and then we didn 't submit for a preferred design but we did submit construction is that you consult with the experts to make sure that they are genuinely accessible and when I talk about genuinely accessible there 's you know there 's no point having a ramp over here and steers over here it 's about everyone using the space together and for designers and planners to really be innovative and come up with a way that we can all be in the same space together ok so I think I mean I don 't know whether you 've had in your feedback I mean it got an ounce today we haven 't been briefed on it but I 'll I presume that um hopefully that first buddy has been briefed on it yet that no well it 's going through an iterative process now so do they 've announced that the the winning design and now they go through a process of working with the designer you know through through a process but I 'm you know I 'm actually on the what he called it the sort of kind of governance group with the minister the two ministers minister or arts minister booth quite recoveries who 's has been delegated dead she 's into the Minister for disability issues yes she is and which is why I 'm sure what I 'm going to say next is not going to surprise you and also max Solomon from nighto who so it 's kind of a you know the strategic partners are and thus together and and that has been a concern that 's already been kind of put on the table so it that 's not going to be lost and and I 'm sure that the group will want to hear themselves what others have to say about as the design progresses and I was just going to ask also we make a lot of submissions on government legislation recently we made one around the changes to the building standards and unfortunate while in my personal view we removed the requirements for certain disability standards so I just wondered whether we need to think of a level of service or a process by what Jeff we 're making submissions to government on certain phones that having them that we should your input because I mean we always have planning so slightly I 've checked here but what submission was there because the last sort of mission that we did was that we see we didn 't want the law changed this was around um this was slightly different this was around the building regulations yeah but we said that we didn 't want an exemption for earthquake strengthening we actually specifically put that on there I find nothing but we 've taken it out so no but I just I guess I was really interested in how do we integrate import from you into our submissions or decision making and I would say contact us and ask yeah I vice I 'm having you know maybe what we need to be doing is actually bringing you on onto committee that 's considering a submission of that nature or or where there is an issue that specifically does require that but imma does also suggest that we 've got more decision-making power than we actually have at the moment yeah the edl GE as an advocacy group made up of a foundation ccs so together as a group we could definitely provide you with the information and technical expertise that you need for submissions and it would just be our our men date it is important to start getting the accessibility and to all levels of planning and regulation in strategy from the top I mean it 's interesting well you know when we deal with you know sort of ruining our issues that will get pointed in the right direction by you know an agency that 's been set up that represents the the six Bruno know that we deal with so and they just point us in the right direction when we need to be consulting on a particular issue and and maybe that 's the role that you guys could play as well we would be very interested in playing that role that would be excellent thank you very much thank you for each them thanks for time no thank you for yours Warren Feeny arts voice Christchurch _"

    "text": "new brighton pier for short and promotion society Eleanor bodger and dr. John call of it was for um for counselors it 's the supplementary submission document yes because we we hit a couple of Fallout and and a couple put on in their place thanks very much protein a concertina Krakatoa me Adele deal in counselors thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to our submission watches a request to include the Legacy Project in the long-term plane we were heartened on Monday and it would seem we need to be really hurt and today and by the response to of counsel to pull down and submission on behalf of New Brighton business and landowners association and we 're feeling very enthusiastic about being one of the first projects for development Christchurch we are aware that the legacy product is just one of the vital pieces of fabric that are required for regeneration of the area and Paul has already addressed this we are confident that the legacy project will improve the quality of life for our residents new brighton is already building a community cohesion we cafes in the area there is increasing strength and some of the established businesses there is growing popularity of the new brighton market with the growth in numbers in the types of stalls and increasing visitor numbers successful events are increasingly common such as the kite day coast to coast sand castle event in easter egg hunt to name a few we will continue to build on these successes however as councillors aware we still need significant assistance and investment in the area dr. john cook will give some insight into the post earthquake demographic of this area thank you I just like to bring a community health perspective to this the immediate area supports around about 16,000 people represents three point five percent of the population of Christchurch I 've worked in the area as a general practitioner for just under 40 years and operate from the large medical practice that serves twelve thousand registered people so we we service will serve seventy-five percent of the population in the area this actually translates into 78,000 face-to-face contacts with staff clinical staff that 's nursing staff as well as doctors area I believe it gives a unique perspective into the social and economic elements that make up our community an internationally accepted standard of socio economic deprivation is a term used geocoding in the measure and geocoding are quintiles the twenty percent divisions within that quintile one being the most advantageous quintile five being the least advantageous in our area we are seventy-five percent of the population that lies within the lower quintiles however we do have a very high level of home ownership which indicates a fairly substantial supportive community disposable incomes after essentials are very tight and where you see a lot of this we are over-represented in hospitals and our patients we 're all so over-represented in non-attendance reflecting a difficulty and travel for a lot of our clientele with the limited disposable incomes this means the ability for individual families to fund leisure activities travel and provide good quality food I 've put down here but good quality food is easily compromised and we have a social worker attached or employed by Medical Center and she is very active in the area of supporting people at the leisure and health of the community activities need to be located close to our community just a comment it was mentioned I think after Paul 's Arlen 's presentation that we were adopted down in the area an actual fact that dr. retired and we took over the practice and the staff of their practice and we have experienced a growth including or excluding any additional practices we have taken on of a thousand people over the last three years it was my mistake i do I college eyes Florida had been told that the doc the doc a doctor had left and that 's what I repeated so I dog college eyes for that I was hoping it wasn 't you we have a pharmacy down yeah but the at the point that I was made it was in response to a ball it was my comment that one of the issues and I know it was you that first raised it with me was the loss of residents in the area that we need to build more houses in the area to bring back more residents as numbers to support services as well we 've noted positively that the influx we are experiencing is young families in spite of school school closures and an influx of self-employed younger folks working area such a design architecture and IT and we expect this activity to feed into the regrowth of our business district as they move from operating in their own homes and we 've seen this to requiring office space in associated facilities which we hope the legacy pull will form met a million counselors we believe that an aquatic center will make a much-needed facility accessible to our community and have a very positive effect on our communities well-being our submission shows the amount of community support that as project hairs and you 'll see that footnote on page one nothing since the days of the pier has so unified this community the Legacy Project on with the staged development of the business area as our golden opportunity the new brighton pier for sure and promotional society are aware that our council faces complex financial and legal issues some of the statutory obligations charge council with the and we 've made reference to this on the final page of our submission the inclusion of the legacy project into the long-term plan will assist council to satisfy these requirements some of our members operate businesses in the business area or on the periphery of their area and we believe that building the legacy pools will give a positive to signal to people like us into new investors by placing the legacy project and the plan it will also enable it to be integrated with the new brighton master plan and it will enhance that plan it will assist development Christchurch to progress it 's wider brief and a structured managed and focused way we have been assured that 5 million dollars is sitting aside for the legacy project and that 3.2 million can be added into the fund by the smart inclusion of the adjoining whirlpool in children 's recreational area additional funding is of course required and whether this comes through the long-term plan or private philanthropic interests as for council and development Christchurch too determined we are here to assist Annette process and for the reasons plan will pay it play a major part in making our councils new brighton master plan a success and along with it the successful rebuild of brighton thank you so much for listening to our submission we 're happy to take questions if we 've got time ok yet another time but can I just ask question of because I don 't actually know the answer to this but that the cost of repairing the pier I mean that that ended up on the page of the paper the other day and I think the headline was kind of like double the cost of building it in the first place has the parent for Shore society which was such a pivotal part of actually getting the pier built in the first place said they have they looked at that that whole repair strategy and and and have they got any views on it it 's quite hard for me to talk to this and drawn and I our new members of pier and for sure and the meeting that 's unfair the anomalous I won 't ask you the question we 'll get an answer I don 't want to take up your time I was just going to say as treasurer or a clear foreshore no we haven 't right yeah because I think I think that 's got to be part of the solution as well I think you can 't isolate new brighton and to the different component projects it now has to be an integrated joined up hungry yeah approach yeah yani thank you i 'm really interested in the legacy project and just understanding the kind of dynamic behind how it will revitalize new brighton from the expression ventures that we went out we were suggesting that the cost eight to ten dollars per person for us for a swim they 're never be the spend or thirty five to forty dollars for the private pools and 85 to 120 for the wellness beauty area so given what you know about that community and about that the existing people that that either love a new brighton look or go to New Brighton would would you think that you know for a family of four that three hundred thousand people a year they 've those sorts of prices I think the respond to that we need to be privy to the structure of the project and I there doesn 't there something which we have not progressed I usually think that it that the actual documentation referred to other facilities around the country um yeah so I 'm just wonder Stan we were at because when we went out for the eoi they 're not the right people to ask Yanni I mean I don 't know what weren 't you trying to make but look but it 's not it 's not it 's not these good people I just come here to make a passionate plea on behalf of New Brighton so we heard this morning from a group that promotes a promenade along along the piers oh sorry San Jones which was quite a compelling case when I can fit it in my mind to that kind of legacy project which doesn 't really have any bones to it or flesh to bits because it was top-down Yanni it was our idea no said we 'd like to talk about the concept of a legacy project and the community advisory group got together they came up with an agreed position that it would be the hot salt water pools and and we 've now gone through a process there are more processes to go through and the idea of having development Christchurch pokers are you know I mean I just think that we 're not using these people 's time productively I mean we 're whipping us to consider progressing the construction on the foreshore of the hot salt water pools cover nor whether have that project including long-term plan put significant budget to the project and all I 'm trying to understand is from what we heard this morning if we have to prioritize them if we have limited funding available for a kind of immediate short-term project sorry yonni we 've already got that on you know that has already been decided that will set aside five million dollars for it so it 's already been decided I agree that what we were presented with this morning has been worked up it came to us there is still a way to go with the part and I guess that the message I want to give back but the money is there and you 're asking that we potentially set aside more and I think that that 's got to be done in the concept on the in the context of looking at the whole of New Brighton not just at the individual projects so but Glenn did you have a yeah it was just ask dr. cook is few on obviously what 's happened to the wider privateer has had a profound impact on that social well-being of the community could you give us your view on the signal as well as the actual placement of the celexa project and the community what what would that do in your professional view in the kind of collective mindset of the community well we encourage physical activity and we encourage connectivity as a health-promoting tool and I believe that putting a leisure facility close to an area of of need would benefit and its really my brief answer to you yeah so okay sure i don 't know you 've got a submission of your own but do you want to just include that i mean i can give you another couple of minutes or something that i felt that the focus for us today needed to be the legacy project so i 'm quite happy to put that to one side but i 'm also quite heavy to come back to yannis concerns really for us john and i became involved because we are enthused by the potential here so we 're enthused by new thinking that 's happened not only in christchurch button some of the directions that have come from government so about working across different agencies in a way that we 've never worked before we are really enthused by flexible in agile thinking so the type of thing that balances maybe the need to make sure that a facility such as the legacy pool is financially viable along with the huge social need that we see in our community and we think there are great ways to me both of those needs and we 've had lots of haven 't had the opportunity yet to have those discussions with development christchurch to bring you something that 's got more structure and that 's you know those who meets those sorts of requirements but we 're excited by the potential because it is just new thinking new thinking gives us lots of opportunities with the thing with Paul Shannon when he came the other day as is that I did reflect on the fact that never before has the property owners and I mean the business owners and the landowners come together and he has managed to bring the two together and because people keep asking well why hasn 't this been fixed before and I mean in my view that the the piers been successful in bringing people to New Brighton but it doesn 't bring people into New Brighton because people don 't cross the road and come under the and to the new brighton area and there 's a lot of reasons for their the slow road was supposed to be the answer to everything but when I opened the snow road I said anyone who actually started at the wrong end we should have started down the other end by the pier and work back but the slow road was never going to solve the real problem which was there was no connection between the businesses and the landowners and there was a whole lot of absent well there was no connection between the car park owners and in the different sites as well so you couldn 't get an integrated development happening and now we 've got this one opportunity in my view to actually finally get that done David 's just a comment i think i 've been involved with probably three or four master plans over my own it 's why i 'm so the portal has to play virtually without exception all of them talked about starting at the beach and moving careens the business area and another none of them have none of them have actually done there and I think what we are talking out here today with legacy projects and and promenades actually starts to achieve what master plans have set out and over a number of years foreshore and work back into the business district and I think the the track that we are now pursuing with a number of projects is exactly what successive master plans have told us to do yep totally agree thank you very much _"

significant but I thought it was important they 'd kill all our services that 's right so the council hidden why why disturb is to use possible I weekend amino health system I 'm coming as a private individual but I do we can a mental health also here for teenagers aged 20 to 14 and I live in the brunswick area which is a very w syria with large migrant and refugee community and also a large estate housing complex and I read the long-term plan and I thought that I was just really stand by the amount of work and the clarity of something that was in the document and I can understand that complete dilemmas of the council hairs and a number of the areas and what the end the difficult options for the council I guess I 'd like to start by saying that the citizens of Christchurch really need can it is disconcerting to hear in the media that print sense that the new and deeply near haven 't_''_95.46 been paid as a sort of or that the council of lost the ability to do build and consent or in a column yesterday there were some criticism of the social housing you unit in as a citizen I guess we 're tasking you with complex decision making and trusting that you 'll do the best you can and we really need confidence in the council ability to do that and it would go an awfully long way towards people here in trust and council just I guess the citizens of Christchurch much more politicized so now we 're previously so people are taking much more interest in the city in the way the city works and a huge range of views but that we 're not the same populations movie post-quake and probably more feisty and and but I think overall it 's a really really good thing and the democracy in Christchurch I guess I 'd say to the council that we have a lot of assets of just going to be impossible to do all the things that need to be done in a fast way and so I for instance would be happy for things to stretch out things to be delayed to pace to to try and we kept what needs to be done first and what needs to be done later I don 't know what to make about it it 's elves that seem clearing the long term plan a there are some very difficult choices for the council I prefer the assets weren 't sold or as few as little ugly as its we 're told as possible i also accept that may be necessary and i guess i would however like as assassin to have as much information about that process as possible and i did see that in the long term plan that there were some assets which were going to be solved fused and others it might be out with something that looked like they might be sold in total and others it might be so it seemed to be a very varied approach to the different assets at that I have four teenagers who would like to live in the city and anecdotally ders hard for people to young people to stay at the moment there 's not a lot awful lot for young people to do they need to be an approach to employment which is wider than just building this construction and John for people to have confidence and city going forward I 'd also like to say that we have a tremendous some really tremendous resources in the city the library system is second to none and New Zealand I also think that the Botanical Garden and some of the art gallery was a really special building that people used to come from other places to see in visit so there 's some things we have done really well and it would be able to shame to reduce those things or also that I 'm the court theatre again as something which is really a tremendous resource and so I do think we do need to safeguard or certainly support the really good things that we had going here I 've had some surgery recently I 've been having to use public transport and I just would say that the I mean public transport is is not an option for I mean some people have to use public transport the most vulnerable people in us that he do and I have found it really good and easy to use and we just need to continue with it I support the changes and bus lanes in the end the central bus exchange but some people just don 't have an option about using public transport it 's important that they supported and doing the edge in terms of social housing and homelessness again the very difficult dilemmas there was a very interesting article and Dominion Post yesterday talking about the cost of social housing to whoever funds it and had some NGOs who had taken over some social housing and saying that they weren 't able to you know it best they were breaking even sometimes it was costing them to run it and I do you think someone needs to provide social housing the intricacies or whatever you difficult so end I guess the trouble to social housing in Christchurch environment sue me as a major crisis so it was it you I wanted to say it but it buys them in and then David yes thank you Karen if they 're working could you give us your view plays at the cost of not providing social housing why we games they 're not providing options over I i acquire understand stenting of the council 's in about who should do it and it 's almost as much point is fierce weather at central government or or the council in a way just I was in a meeting in the central city the other day and and people were locking the door because they were afraid I mean obviously that people homeless people in case that Congress people came into the building and people will tell you about going overseas and hissing homeless people in the streets and the umpires on Torres only more so on safety of citizens I weekend it is very difficult to get me into little people well if I don 't have adequate housing mysm yeah it 's a it tremendous stress for people who don 't_''_433.24 I do quite handsome David thank you in the corner of one of your pages under financial plan you ask the question is there any other way of raising revenue which could be considered yes I raising money from non ratepayers what ideas would you have in mind I don 't know but I just see it seems to me that we are I mean I quite understand it pro you know large rate rises are difficult for businesses and individuals but listening to me that there should be some way of isn 't even you for the council from people who use facilitating something other than a politics yes I don 't know I don 't know that is certainly seeing that the council needs to consider anything at Quillan at the moment ah Mia soonly the long term plan made you realize the financial position the council 's own oh good okay good look thank you kids good to see you thank you for the

    "text": "sure Rachel 's here no John Robinson good afternoon sorry to keep you waiting no problem at all hello everybody I present here today as a private citizen but also come with mother heads as a community development social worker having worked and Christchurch and one enjoy another floor last 16 years firstly all to acknowledge the incredibly difficult position at the current council is in you lead hand a lead by the city and addressing the legacy of the seismic events of 2010 and 2011 thank you for the enormous individual and corporate energy that 's being invested in this work legacy a series of outcomes that follow events and decision-making processes whether they be deeply personal or broadly enter person we 're all living out some kind of legacy at the moment the quakes brought their own legacy of devastation at many different levels the city was broken but they also leave positive legacy in the intense outpouring of deliberate community and the minutes weeks months and years after the events care for others and worse circumstances heroic efforts by individuals and organizations at providing for people 's human care and comfort and considering the role of LTC CP is coping with the negev legacy and propagating the positive legacy of the quakes I want to highlight a number of issues firstly housing thank you for taking this seriously please retain a focus on providing social housing and affordable housing in conjunction with central government and the private sector I 've done the rental dance with my family like so many people have in this city and I constantly have people in my office as a community worker who are doing that dance and a lot worse circumstances than our family let 's keep it a focus infrastructure thank you for seeking the best possible result for our needs a clean water electricity gas services and transport routes we all need these to sustain life and we all need connection with others to make the act of living meaningful and sustainable enduring local national international research acknowledges that strong relationships other thing that enabled people to transcend difficult circumstances and make the most of what facilities remain it 's the relationships that count speaking of facilities the community place the places that facilitate those strong relationships now with the carnage wrought by the quakes the views of facilities has understandably under review but there are questions how will the community have important to which facilities remain open and are appeared what provision would be made for the community organizations who are occupy facilities that may well have to close already underfunded community a community agencies could not afford market rents or in most cases sustained for facility management responsibilities therefore low cost access to the use of council community facilities by community organizations needs to remain on a contrast this notion against the discourse regarding the anchor projects firstly I acknowledge the incredibly complex contingency surrounding these projects in terms of managing relationship with central government my concern is that Christchurch may increasingly become a city divided among socio-economic lines with big projects that we 're all paying for only accessible by a smaller proportion of us we may end up being a city rich and facilities but poor in relationships and that will make us all the more vulnerable to disaster the strength of community strategy says communities by providing opportunities for all people to have fair and equitable access to services and resources we our city have been admired internationally for innovation and excellence on a budget as community responses proliferated in the aftermath of the quakes and continue to happen in my view smaller scale projects that decrease expenditure and enable broad community access are a better more sustainable solution going forward for us all an example of this is the lynnwood service center and library being developed at eastgate this dynamic initiative is incredibly positive for the lynnwood whilst on Phillipstown communities and a lower income area having easily easily exist hug to which people can walk or cycle is very beneficial well done I would urge council to consider committing to the lynnwood service center and library becoming a permanent permanent position that a tree said tongue eastgate I 'm nearly done excellence and innovation on a budget in early March this year she a very quick personal story I had one of the greatest privileges of my life that of jun ying with my 89 year old mum through the last stages death of a parent in different ways I wasn 't able to be there from idea but I was from my mum she lived a legacy not in physical assets but from a life devoted to the selfless care of others and the communities in which she lived looking after people 's physical needs through baking were providing food vouchers showing genuine interest in the health and well-being of those around her creating opportunities for connections between people by having them in a modest little over 60 s unit mum got the basics right she made the best of what we thought what she had and so should we as a generation look to leave a legacy for future Christchurch resonance let it be a legacy of provision for the basic needs of all and through creation of context and for meaningful life and hearts and connection with others encouraging innovation excellence and community on a budget the I kind of want to just just applaud you really I know I know I stopped applause the other day but I just want to applaud I do serious if we 've then I want to thank you too for a have your an excellent submission in it 's quite trip that 's been quite prefer on it for me in greetings for me as a former social worker to myself so I do I want to ask you a question which I asked another submitter because you refer to that housing and people are vulnerable I just want to ask you your viewer as a social worker and community worker around about count like any council role in supporting housing for the homeless or people who are homeless well I think it 's incredibly important and rather than just repeat the words of other people that spoke and although i 'm going to i think people in vulnerable considerations create vulnerability for others We certainly have quite a number of homeless people through our Center that I 'm a resource center and for those that were able to provide support for and some way shape or form gear the it 's great for them which is fantastic and the ERISA to the wider community is lessened so I agree with a proactively care for a most vulnerable it makes sense their hearts and it also makes sense to their pockets ultimately long-term thank you very very much so I 'm sorry but it 's thank you and _"

    "text": "now Jillian can I not not not that I 've ever seen you before obviously I come from New Brighton I in a 69 year old mother in grandmother who has lived in New Brighton for 39 years and i am here to present my personal here is the lighting the submission that I am filled in and sent and approximately two weeks ago I believe thank you for your speedy reply good like that I am also a new member of the north New Brighton Residents Association so I will start off with tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou katoa greetings to you all I have lived a new brighton for 39 years during this time i have experienced the waxing and waning of new brightens popularity as a place to live on in to visit SI was unable to attend the non-nato trust presentation this morning I wish to voice my views on the Christchurch coastal pathways plan first I have no scientific data to support my views but I do have many years of anecdotal experience over the time I have lived in New Brighton there have the beach Oh into various knee hip and spinal operations so I have had personal experiences of how frustrating and disappointing it can be not to have access to the beach however my disabilities have not been permanent and now I can get to the beach whenever I like this is not so for many many others in the past week alone I have seen people and wheelchairs sitting in the New Brighton and the north near Brighton car parks seeking to enjoy the view they can go no further we need adequate funding to create a promenade walkway so people of all physical abilities young and old have equal opportunities to enjoy the beautiful views and coastline and mandurah Perth there is a coastal walkway stretching along the jeans for at least five kilometers I have walked at many times as well as the wonderful promenade on the coastline and New Plymouth we should be able to do likewise here in Christchurch on my submission I objected to the closing of the South New Brighton campground during the city six years I taught at south near Athens called many provided a wonderful site for schools from all over Canterbury to run their educational programs we are oaks and the city here RV new 2 equals us not only his the campground provided great educational opportunities for the schoolchildren of Canterbury but it also provides a great facility for national and international visitors keep the campground open and send the freedom campus there to Kemp instead of camping and our car parks another great new brace and outdoor facility is the Rafferty golf club the path that runs through it from shore after Bo Hill Road as a main thoroughfare for all the walkers ambushes mobility vehicle drivers cyclists all who want to commute from North bryson to New Brighton and vice versa scores of people use us pass daily I have some questions what happens to this path of the land is sold who owns this land and who has the right to sell it we all want you brighten to flourish and be a safe friendly environment where residents can have their needs met locally we also want to bring more visitors to New Brighton we need interesting will want to come and spend quality time and the seventies and a chase this is my one of my favorite topics we had a very good movie theater the Roxy it was within walking distance for the locals and it was a great venue for school holiday programs local communities from the crash kindergartens schools plunkett etc could hire the venue for fundraising ventures not only the locals used it but people from all over Christchurch came to these events and returned again and again so many suburban and city theaters have closed down and those that are are open are a long bus ride or car ride from Brighton a new brighton theater would have few parking problems and would provide jobs for locals especially appear as a cafe attached the miramar suburban theater and Wellington has been very successful for decades and people travel from all over wellington from upper heart to see tune to go to that theater and enjoy milks their people and Christchurch would come to bryson to the movies and would be able to do this shopping there as well an order to businesses to start off we need to address the problems caused by absentee landlords who have let their properties and buildings deteriorate there needs to be a set of guidelines for all landlords private and commercial so they can be held accountable for the upkeep of the properties as they were set criteria they had to adhere to they would be compelled to keep the properties at standard or else they should face certain fines and penalties last millennium and 1976 when we move to brighten the idea of heaven hot salt water pools was being muted what year is this 39 years ago we came from Canada and chose to live a new brighton when we could have lived anywhere else in New zeeland it was a safe family-friendly environment where residents could have all he needs me locally overseas visitors still marvel at our beautiful coastline the amazing views and our fresh clean air we need to entice them to stay longer spend the money share their experience periences and return again and again in conclusion I will quote an old moldy proverb my feral mar mar pang cooperation of the red that 's you the counselors and the black that 's us the ratepayers we will and we can accomplish our goals together come in to thank you very much um we 're we 're out of time but I should make a couple of comments one is the referee golf course the issue was around the funding of it so we 've got a paper on the agenda of the council meeting tomorrow which would if it 's accepted see the question of the tendering of the rub UT golf course so people if the golf club wants to put an attender to run it then that will be an option that will be able to consider during the the course of the time of the plan so that when we come to the plans end we will have an answer to that question would the golf club be able to run it the second as the as the South New Brighton came similarly we 've got an item on the agenda to deal with that but not similarly to the other we wouldn 't be would be in the sense that there are a number of things that really need to be on the table and one of them is in relation to the the coastal hazards and coastal inundation work that 's been done around two of the natural hazards chapter so there are issues in terms of a longer-term view of parts of that area and and and we need to be thinking about that but the idea is to go out for tenders I personally would rather that we just worked with the people who 've actually been running the camp for the last four years as a on a month-by-month contract basis which is pretty horrendous for them but we 're bound by the procurement processes that we have in place so that we 'll have that discussion tomorrow but I just wanted you to know that you know there is a process that we put in place to try and deal with those two issues and in a way that is more appropriate I have to say then a an amendment to an activity management plan that wasn 't really Tim thank you just at the beginning of presentation when you talked about than you brought in promenade boardwalk project and you said you weren 't an expert and an RMA hearing of Commissioner may class a person with long-standing knowledge and deep knowledge of an area as an expert witness and I think we should do the same i think 39 years living and the one environment kind of gives you that right so thank you very much for them well thank you for that them and see if you all for listening i know i went over time and thank you for the opportunity pinky thank you very much rachel curry _"

    "text": "and could I have carolyn 's as its Adele and Jocelyn pepperell acura I 'm submitting on behalf of both myself Caroline sottile and my partner toast and Pepsi okay thank you today Taylor Kolkata and this proposed plan is for an enormous task with competing priorities limited resources but it 's also part of the blueprint for Christ 's teachers future this is the opportunity to build a better city and a more effective community and to me that 's a really important thing the plan is titled smart choices to me smart choices are those that lead to a socially and environmentally sustainable city a city that can adapt the environmental risks that we already know about and that can do a better job of responding to human needs than we 've been doing recently it 's the small projects and small businesses that have kept the center of the city alive since the quakes and creative places for people to come together and its neighbors and the many small organizations many of which I 've just heard from we 've just heard from recently that continue to model we need to use for redeveloping a city small-scale organic and community focused I strongly support developing public transport safe walking and cycling routes an accessible City I would like to see these as the drivers for transport decision making not as add-ons we need the Planning and infrastructure that normalizes foot bike in public transport that makes it normal again because it has been an hour passed in our early past we need sufficient investment and public transport cycling walking infrastructure and accessible design and we need to get away from the dominance of the car this is essential for Christchurch to be sustainable both in face of increased fuel costs and to be an attractive and safe place both the residents and visitors and social housing for Christ 's Church has been inclusive City we need to continue to provide social housing this is a moral imperative i believe to support the vulnerable of the city but it 's also a melon lies and self-interest if we have people who feel disconnected from our city who don 't feel a valued part of it they become expensive also health they are part of our city we need to support them terms of council facilities and generalized support smaller local facilities maker facilities facilities that are accessible reachable by for the public transport the sort of facilities in fact that would be more accessible to the over 65s a group that the document comments under uses rec centers and pause and I think if we look at the models that are happening in retirement complex is now we 've got small-scale local and apparently popular facilities for those people I think we can build a public version of that we can have local small-scale public facilities and we can do the same for youth facilities and and provide places for people to come together in the scenes of the city I think the things like the pallet prevent and dance met as are examples of small organic things that work really well in this community they bring the community together they make it a place of celebration I don 't see many of the anchor projects as a crucial part of economic and social recovery I think that indefinitely the former AMI Stadium and the Performing Arts Center if we focus on the town hall instead and I think we can scale back delay or building stages the multi-sport facility the convention center car parking and possibly even the central library in terms of funding i believe the Crown 's the council should argue hard for the crown for more central government funding and to prioritize what the people of Christchurch want prioritized prioritized not what the hundred a plan came up with I appreciate that this may be a difficult task but i believe that you the council need to keep representing what we the people want to central government and the share an idea process gave a pretty clear vision of what the people of Christchurch wanted and it 's very different from 100-day plan has come up with in my view I don 't support selling off income generating assets particularly not to fund potentially non income generating assets or even potential liabilities and while I think some degree of rate rises accept gone probably inevitable I think the proposed about a percent is probably made a suggestion about raising funds for a municipal ownership cooperative we 're effectively residents purchase shares and partial Z businesses and within an agreed timeframe the council buys them back so your own those assets for a while get the return problem which of course means the council wouldn 't get returned from that period but they haven 't transferred permanent private ownership and they haven 't transferred out of the city and also through that is way of involving people in the city and potential if he had 50,000 hair salts buying five thousand dollars with this year 's you 'd have 250 million that might not happen but be good start but did with limited funding when you look hard at our priorities this is not the time for grand plans or mini earth proposed anchor projects we need to focus on supporting community initiatives and organizations on stage development and on smaller human scale facilities and community well-being thank you alright thank you Krishna bill thank you very much um you referred to some issues for a city like consumed about Suffolk available housing this one in supporting housing for that people who are homeless about swimming housing for the homeless I think it 's essential I think a community that doesn 't look after its most vulnerable there 's a very poor community indeed i think i think the homeless are part of the people with housing needs here thank you i think we need to start from basic human rights and housing for everyone as a basic human right ok yeah d I know that you 've made a number of comments around the stadium and I know that a scoping studies been completed but I 'm not sure that it 's been made public would it be useful for us to ask the government to make these sorts of studies available to the public so people can see the rationale the business case their options I think that would be useful i think the information that 's being fed out as pretty partial at moment pretty incomplete yes them the ability for the world I suggest that the council would it would be a period of the council by cermak that would be you were buying them for 10 20 years really alone but it 's not really a limpid it 's not it 's not taking on deters it 's giving up equity temporarily as I 'd be investing in what currently council-owned s it 's for a short time and I would know the council would buy them back from me there be such a besom us to renting out their asset to someone else for a period of time and then taking back the ownership somewhat i believe it some football stadiums and freshen use that model yeah and it 's kind of brings it the community in to the ownership as well pleasure to read wrong thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "Victoria and raised I 'd like to thank you for the opportunity of addressing my submission today and I 'd also like to acknowledge the hard work that I know all of you put in over the past few years it 's not an easy task the following slides at illustrate aspects of in town from a residence viewpoint and the focus of my submission is the long-term well-being of the community and pressure points that impact the area and hopefully these will flip over every 10 seconds akaroa is a community under pressure the sea walls are a hundred years old they lack maintenance and are in the state of deterioration storms have become more frequent and a long term impact as significant as verified in the 2013 Falcon and taylor report plans were approved in 2012 to repair the seawall at daly 's wharf next to a children 's playground but work has yet to commence storms of wrecked havoc with a footpath and sea wall but no one to my knowledge has bothered to check the further damage after four requests for service I finally put red sea wall opposite bully Hayes on Beach Road as a way of illustrating the potential hazard to visitors I requested information so that i could understand the council 's rationale of allocating 11 million dollars to replace the main worth which is an integral part of a Carosa storage area I was sent to Heritage assessments and five pages from a 2011 opus International report here heritage New Zealand or the council 's heritage team had been consulted on the matter I have to question the wisdom of spending 11 million dollars to replace the wharf without also taking into consideration the long-term in act of climate change the money may be better spent protecting beach road which is the only access road through the town protecting road access would at least allow time to consider options with regard to rising sea levels some who use the were that said the council has poured money into the structure and that it has never been in better condition but others have told me that it needs maintenance it would seem prudent to consult more widely prior to spending 11 million dollars one of which is the total replacement of the wharf the management plan for marine structures says the cruise ships won an expansion of pontoons to accommodate more tenders and that they also expect the council to cover the cost this is a 37 us billion dollar enterprise why should rapier subsidize the highly profitable cruise ship industry by providing more pontoons tourism operators have said they want no more than one cruise ship a day and many residents would prefer if they gave Acura miss altogether but few are willing to express such concerns in public as an example I 've been told that if I didn 't embrace cruise ships and freedom campers that I would be barred from entering the local businesses so you can understand the reason residents are hesitant to say anything 8286 cruise ships visit echo every year soon they will be carrying up to 5,000 passengers large and multiple shifts per day overwhelmed the town we were told cruise ships were a temporary measure while little to import facilities rebuilt but now it seems council views them as being permanent council needs to banks peninsula there 's more at stake here than the CBD rebuilding ratepayers have been told rapiers we 're told have been told community boards will be given more authority but I wonder if this applies to a Corolla as well I noted the following sentence and a community board agenda quote the repair of the post office service center building has been put on hold while other options are being investigated regarding the integration of council facilities end quote the statement appears to have come from the corporate activities management plan and the building has been shut since 2011 although it now is at a hundred percent of National Building Standards I discussed the matter with a community board through a series of submissions followed by a letter and in return I received correspondence from the council 's senior solicitor claiming that I 'd made serious allegations I was asked to provide information so an assessment could be made as I had failed to use the term quote in my view end quote prior to making one observation I decided to look into the 80,000 communication report commissioned by bunker mentality in internal silos within the organizational structure and it appears that several me still exist this council however has worked very hard to break down barriers and I applaud the mayor 's comment from the press in October 2013 that we don 't want anyone to feel fear in this place for sharing ideas and I support that the community board is also exasperated by this about the status of the post office building because they had not been informed that a decision to defer repairs have been made in my view the community board should be the starting point for any such discussion the historic 1915 post office is the cornerstone of a corolla CBD if a crow is to remain viable and vibrant as a community the building needs to be kept in public ownership and use moving service center staff into an existing facility would reduce the level of service and this also applies to the Information Center which currently operates in a small corner gift shop Christchurch Canterbury tourism should be supporting tourism and economic development through a public-private partnership in the Information Center well as ratepayers makes economic sense the tourism hub like a corolla the service center and information center should be moved back and it fitted out post office building in time to celebrate it 's 104 the public opening and celebration when is their 100th anniversary the building was constructed in 1914 and open formally in 1915 and I could just say I was really disappointed in the echo a museum management plan that was posted in that the museum director and the advisory committee were not consulted and I hope that is remedied in the future so like I 've had my five minutes thank you okay um I 'll just yeah just a couple of questions because we 're unfortunately the times challenging Tim um so we had a presentation earlier on from it the eco tourism a tiki yep so I 'm necessary that they are saying that the cruise ships are really important and are you saying that they would be better off without them but confused you have different viewpoints as a rate here I understand there is some economics benefit although i think it unrealistic as somebody who lives in echo row 365 days out of the year it impinges on our qualitative life quite often you cannot get into the library because all the cruise ship passengers are using free Wi-Fi and computers they ride on a free shuttle all day to go back on board for lunch there is some economic benefit but I don 't think it 's what it 's hyped up to be a lot of people who come to a crow or on budget cruises the small ships are great 80 to 200 people they appreciate where they are they really don 't impact the town but when you see litter flowing through the streets and rubbish that 's not picked up if you 're going to impose that on a Corolla then the council has to do its bit but we we could argue that those businesses that are successful with regards to getting tourism dollars should also do the BET and three with me but but have you have you talked to any of the business sisters to do it because I 'm an assumption should 't knows i 'm actually I 've actually been threatened by local businesses because they say they see me as being anti cruise ships I 'm not anti cruise ships it 's just too many of them as the inundation honest in a one-time pretentious yeah Hilton needs to take the big ships back absolutely when we want little to design the book sheets bang and thirties haven 't_''_565.92 got a crucial rebus at the moma day making for round trips to a clear it 's too much it 's Tara and you are not alone and and and having that view it 's that it 's the a nun dae shin of people at one time multiple cruise ships and large cruise ships but there is no question that the smaller cruise ships they actually like the locker I stopped and and actually prefer it to the little install what what macaronis our visitors will come for two three or four nights yeah that money goes through the town it benefits the community of benefits the region the cruise ships all the money goes overseas everything 's pretty booked think it is some shops do well a lot of shops have closed and or I have copies if of my first official if you 'd like that thank you very much now we will take copies of that is if it fits your written comments right as opposed to your I mean you 're you 're that 's what you just talked to yamo my through so that would be great thank you very much thank you thanks Victoria good to see you _"

    "text": "hello and welcome afternoon thank very much for the chance to speak you with you today I realize you are now into a pretty challenging couple of weeks I think I 've got five minutes and I 'll be brief it 's a personal submission I 've made a number of points in my submission but what I want to focus on today is the idea of creating a complementary currency for Christchurch I 've outlined briefly so hopefully been able to digest at the the sorts of potential benefits that creating this a local currency in Christchurch could could create for the city I think fundamentally transforming Christchurch into a much more sustainable and resilient City as a huge opportunity for the city the you can only go so far with resource efficiency and you need the social dimension you need the environmental dimension that you absolutely need an economic dimension and a complementary currency is a challenging enough thing to embark on but a practical enough thing to actually be able to make it work and get into their innovative doing things more sustainably in the economic space which are supportive of helping the communities to do more themselves but again they would how you the currency your design and what you 're trying to achieve with it would that 's actually the first stage is really working that out so really it 's a process of trying to identify needs and in the community with resources that are there that are not being joined together well enough at the moment money as a means to an end its means to facilitate exchange so that 's what you 'll be trying to achieve with the Christchurch currency of some sort there 's lots of models from around the world that we can learn from there 's lots of advice there are other cities that are doing this it 's not really really widespread but the innovators are there to learn from so it 's a matter of what are the what are we trying to achieve what are the connections that a Christchurch currency would be trying to make what are the models that we can use it would be able to be implemented here and you know _''_121.89 that 's the right model and that 's what we should do in Christchurch I don 't think so there 's a matter of embarking on the journey but it 's definitely a possible and I think a really exciting proposition rice church and would be getting into the world-leading space if we could if we could do it well so I know you have a lot on your plate and the city does too and keeping up whether it must be a challenge but it don 't start laying the foundations for some of these of more cutting-edge ideas then they won 't get off the ground so my suggestion is I 'd love to see you say this is an idea that 's that 's got potential let 's approach it carefully but robustly and and start trying to make sense of this as an idea for Christchurch and it could become an alternative effectively alternative funding stream but also an alternative way of facilitating getting the work that needs doing in the city done but getting it done and a more community-based and more beneficial way in got five minutes so if I can answer any questions and a free space the time happy to do so and otherwise good luck great well Rafe I 'll start Tim thanks very much and we 've already had another presentation on the complementary and community currencies today so it 's good to see your one right in terms of proceeding from here I me obviously this is happening around the world I 've just been sent some information from Tucson in Arizona where they 're implementing new one as well yeah so what do we need to do as a council to make this happen I think I mean and we 've talked about i mean i 've seen models where i can say gee that one looks like it would be really good in christchurch and every as with these complete systemic things every place is different so i think there 's a project to basically develop a business case we say you know there 's some foundational work to do to look at it exactly work with the community what would we really we can 't do would we be trying to achieve got to understand a little bit better the challenges and some of those are sort of reserve bank financial things but some of those will be community perception things as well so better understand that operating space get some advice from people we can say look here 's what others have done and these are the lessons they 've learned and out of that planning process be able to say narrow down to here 's a couple of options that we think could really work for Christchurch this is what it would cost to set them up this is how they work this is what the challenges would be it 's really a good practice project development business case and you need that before you could really embark on actually commit be committing to do it so if you could just come up to an establishment phase I think there would be a great support we 've got 30 seconds left and we 've got David Andrew and Phil thank you thank you look I also been approached on a number of occasions on could say we could have a look at just to get a feel for how it 's worked and implement it I think the you know some of the world leading ones bristol in Brixton and the UK the Verger one which eventually petered out in Austria but it 's known as a really leading example and not in France have just recently established one so understanding how they 've got to getting one going would be for kione 's to look to thank you Andrew thank you I 'm yeah particularly interested in this area and you know we 've obviously had some conversations in the past about how this could work in local neighborhoods lyttelton harbour was our example but I 'm interested in how we could do this across the whole sitting clearly one of the triggers of need for us would be the particular financial situation the city finds itself in at the moment looking at your international examples and I agree that we 've got a lot to learn from looking at where this has been done successfully elsewhere what sort of triggers have started that Slade other communities to the point of the conversation we 're having now I think the key driver is usually local you know strengthening local economies more local employment more local transactions that said a lot of the ones where they 've started from a very grassroots created by a community group they struggle to get enough scale to be viable what gives money value one of the key things that gives money values of being received in Texas and so if the council established to can 't see where you were prepared to accept that for payment of rates and fees that gives that a really tangible value from the get-go so that 's where there 's really that strengthening local economies and getting better utilization out of local resources so it may be about changing the thinking and focusing on working locally as much as saving that it will be necessarily cheaper but it 's about using people 's time and effort and resources that don 't get captured with a new zealand dollar approach and that 's it 's not you couldn 't do it using thinking as well as keep out of it is is your question cupboard it 's ok ok thank you and so let thank you very much but differently food for thought at home of project littleton the time being of time bank is absolutely a complementary currency its purposes to more facilitate community interaction then and so this would be a scale up and then yeah but it has a spectrum yeah so as your ear points card lovely thank you very much _"

'd better check this thank you I 'm Don yes thinking that goes up this position I can see you 're being duped by a paper war and I apologize for adding to it I 'll start speaking you should have a picture in front of you which hopefully will tell without proverbial thousand words I 'm speaking as an outside you cater and a festival organizer and i coordinate the big sing secondary schools music festivals over 20 years and I initiated a secondary schools orchestral festival back in 2002 which are still going strong you 'll see some pictures of those in our town hall I 'd like to call for support for the institutions in the city delivering classical music our orchestras our choirs and our bands I 'd like to encourage you to strengthen your council elbows to reinstate the town hall complex complete with its betterment improve the sound of the James hey to make it a music friendly place it was never designed for music it was designed for the spoken word and I make a suggestion here that perhaps the James hey would be reconstituted as with a new name as Symphony Hall rework the interior we have a haul for the town town hall and we have a hole for the symphony and in terms of cutting costs and providing the CSO with a home and using the dressing rooms out the back as their officers I wonder whether that might be a convenient solution for a number of other problems that you obviously have to deal with in terms of the budget the auditorium is particularly useful for festival you should see in your pictures in two sides one and me waving wildly at about some six or seven hundred kids for a couple of years there and that horseshoe configuration putting all our folk I don 't know where Christ College always finishes up in the center but the whole thing about us and said every school and this is pretty 's kind of a social class or classes we might be divided into east and west and north and south and all that is absolutely fantastic if you look at that picture to see all those kids from every school working together singing together if I have my way and harmony but I never do it 's a social message I think for our city and it 's the future it 's the future of the citizens of Christchurch and those are the brightest and best of those who are going through our city and we are they going to loop over the page that 's me by the way that 's not me that 's woody southgate I think standing addressing the troops but we 've got such a wonderful place because you 've got the horseshoe upstairs in front of the organ and you can put thousands of cygnets there literally and down below you 've got a flat floor which enables us to have as you can see they 're up to a thousand kids playing instruments together with in fact the Christchurch symphony in the middle school cooperation private state integrated for prize-giving zand graduations the place is often full I 've seen comments that we don 't need anything like that we only need two thousand we don 't need a 1500 seat or whatever and there will be a slope floor and then nobody will use that anybody will complain so keep to the plan that you 've agreed to this lets our children be aesthetically formed we 've got primary secondary tertiary festivals we 've got school prize-giving is got all sorts of things that place should be packed and will be packed for five years we 've had no auditorium there 's been no coral orchestral gatherings they 've all had to go after separate places or at a horrendous cost to hire the arena which is hopeless as a musical venue we 're told by one of our national politicians that we 're going to be the sporting capital of New Zealand but what about the arts if christ church is to be a desirable location live in what quality of cultural life for our kids research shows it 's an bore you with it that the brightest and best job seekers think Silicon Valley want a city where their children will have great opportunities for their artistic talents to flourish and weather is a lively traditional appscene we want people to come to the city to live here it 's for their kids often that 's why they 'll leave the big smoke overseas they 'll come back for an education here what we can offer in Christ through a good Town Hall is the quality of life that they weren 't necessarily good in other parts and finally and how do those of us who care approach the council without input people have talked about it Out 's policy we 're not I 'm never sure whose door is there a door that somebody like me who has a concern can bang on and irritate somebody even more than I am perhaps at the moment all of you so that 's all I wanted to say before we get to the prostitutes thank you you 're absolutely not irritating in any way shape or form but you would you because whatever you my hand I don 't want you to run out of time as the only exactly nota like what would you want me to do um you might as well carry on and you may have Christians on there you want to do the lot yes I know but so has Pauline and so of i and you know Oh carry on carry on carry on with the prostitute right oh no so carry on the room sorry they just send a very funny yeah good good good film series Sevilla and I 'm musical director and have been for 46 years of CBS music that 's Cathedral business acumen to say a lot of space now it 's at Mary 's pro-cathedral and then we 're down the red light area and but there 's a lot of religious and concert used message coming up I 'm aware that there aren 't any easy answers us and law law making is probably not the answer what 's happening out in the street has a severe impact on our pro-cathedral the gardens full of condoms fringes blood-soaked picking them up every morning because we received about there 's lots of concerts I think one of the bits of paper hopefully you 've got in front of you shows another one that 's coming up with maybe you can show you the inside we can put 500 to say we can put 600 people in fact in that building and there 's a lot of young people who are standing on Manchester Street waiting to be picked up well I mean really is that what we want all the usage is going to increase we 're putting one and a half million dollars into a new parish and music center right alongside this it 's going to be great for the city arts it 's going to be at home for lots of choirs and orchestras in one month back in 2012 and council came up with recommendations I have the original document here and if you 're around at the time that has some recommendations at the back and it suggested our rubbish bins toilets and lighting that was a 92 2012 street prostitution whose residual part could happen some suggestions maybe a council cleanup crew not necessarily any of you every morning with gloves and bins before the early morning mess know where they can cover the best first that 'd be good for them perhaps provide a porta com bills as were proposed that was going to go through but Briscoe 's who live around the corner don 't actually function on me just mention street at all said they didn 't want it for some obscure reason really so I 'm told the the Christchurch Health Board has its headquarters over the road and he said that the guy in charge of that said he 'd be very keen to have it and he 's put extra lighting opportunity to keep the ways it likely because the way to do it of course the area is being gentrified there 's an up-market furniture store frobisher 's just over the road with a very nice and coffee bar for those of you clients that way and listen you an apartment block being built so as gentrification increases maybe the prostitutes will move out but we somebody suggested that at one point that that would be a logical home to provide things this residential and shops but I don 't to be a NIMBY Christian duty well Jesus tried to look after the prostitutes and there isn 't a proposal that cathedral parish at the way to put up a huge fence i think that would create very bad vibes in terms of where the catholic cathedral fits another ghetto we don 't need any of that again how those of us who care approach the council whose door do we knock on is my question but thank you for the chance to be here I know that Pauline wants to answer that last question yeah and you think you don 't so you know it is difficult issue in there is a lot of NIMBYism_,_543.13 so it wasn 't just Briscoe 's he kicked up about any porter calm with a portaloo ID or anything like that he 'll tell you their number le and I have been working very hard on this I 'll world but if you want to approach either of us with you did you come to a public meeting that we had last year down in the function room I 've come to every meeting I could together with other folks saying how concern we are about the impact on our place what I 'd love to have a meeting with you off right ahead a chat we are making Kofi subtly appreciate and thank you for cleaning up around your own building and it would be nice if we could find people to help you with it so he will be in touch and not the other quick you head around the town hall yep so dumb one how many did the auditorium seat two and a half thousand two and a half thousand thank you for our deal sighs okay um Tim and then Yanni i 'm thinking i love the idea of the sea so it was awesome organization using as a home i just think it 's wonderful i quite like the jet the james hey side of it I notes you know it was fit for the spoke with and but I think to revamp done the other fly floors etc but I think earlier on we had an issue with regards to the Isaac Theatre Royal at its availability as as being really tested because the need and if to very high class stages with full I floors i think as there 's certainly in need but to have the cs i think based the or an organization to use it as a home because it wery areas in there that didn 't work properly as they were originally designed for so i think that 's a really good idea the other question regards to mention silicon valley and that we 're getting more and more people working from home because of the in the technology etc and you struggle so the Christchurch should be a city with people want to bring your family so they return with regards to the arts or so and the children with what you do what do you see the biggest challenges for you interesting that a lot of the homeschooled kids and are the most involved in music perrin see this is a huge priority it 's the money yeah or the outdoor world okay yeah I just um thank you for you to tighten I just wanted to check that your weather council wants to remove the whole castle arena and the shareholding of vivos which are in the town hall from a strategic assets it said that there 's not the council documents state that it 's not necessary necessary council to retain ownership for the well-being of the community now given your experiences in the past in terms of accessing the Town Hall possibly accessing the arena for certain events do you think it 's important that council retains strategic ownership of these or do you think that there 's something that could be wrong I like a brief comment on that my wife and I were amazed in Seoul Korea to find and two nights in a row the hall the the main concert hall insult full of an amateur no pay an orchestra and huge choir and each night it was young people all young people my wife remember by far the oldest eluted as some of these folk how is it night was a Mozart Missa Solemnis electrons there beethoven 9th symphony i think i said other council doesn 't they they because they see the value of this kind of cultural activity for our age group they let us have the hall at a reduced rental and they provide an enormous krrish just over the other side of the beautiful big plots in the middle tool where the young mothers can park their kids and then go and play music and lots of young mothers and and so on taking powder so that 's to me those the kind of things where the council can see itself as a lubricant for a good quality of life where it can help and if things are privatized and become financially prohibitive because only the dollar will rule you won 't have orchestras and choirs which are I mean all I spoke over there not not there because of money and the CSO wasn 't paid for the night that they played with the kids so right well thank you very very much okay and chance to speak thank you now we 're going to suggest that we stop now for a break because if we don 't stop now for a break then counselors are not going to be concentrating on submitters and we 'll see if we can make up some time as we go so if we could just grab a quick cup of tea and be back here at 315 thank you _"

    "text": "if we could invite that rhodora sagal from booths right christchurch sorry i 'm probably dreadfully merciless pronouncing your name oh the afternoon my name is rhodora sightless and I 'm the manager of birthright I stretch so exactly fraternity right ok thank you we 've the east was missing so I didn 't do too badly a bit so right yeah so birthright christchurch has been here we 've been here for more than 50 years we believe that all children have a right a happy secure and loving environment home environment we work with one parent families to facilitate the growth of confidence resilience and skills of these families we work with around 100 families around christchurch and we could do more but we only have two part-time field workers so a lot about lifting are on the waiting list so what do we do majority of our work our home visits by our two field workers we give a national support for school holiday events and uniforms funding for permits and we work with advocacy going to work and income hospitals and other offices that they would training and we refer to other agencies we do practical help such as help with clothing and household items I 've been a manager for two months and I 've heard quite a lot of stories from our field workers and I 'd like to share some of them to you this afternoon we had a mom with a braid with a head injury and the field worker worked with her for quite a while and she gained her self-confidence back she now works as a volunteer at a police station some parents are now either studying or doing some part-time work there was a young girl who attended our girl girl group training last year she was very unmotivated and really wanna go to any like further training but she now attends regularly the adult literacy center of hadley College community Hadley community college in st. Albans and there 's this mom she is a very very serious eating disorder she couldn 't eat and with some support from the field worker she she 's able to get on eating she 's now eating and it 's just a meal together I couldn 't tell you more but I think these are the ones that struck most for our workers and to me so who do we work with we work with single parents mostly female but we also have a bed and a grandad we have grand grand moms looking after their grandchildren majority may feel isolated because they don 't have family support most have financial hardships out of the hundred families that we work with fifty five percent of this are from the eastern part of the city some may suffer from mental emotional physical issues and parenting skills we are located at the Community House at 30 12 m straight and why do we stay there one is value for money on your handouts I added the rent costs that birthright was paying pre-earthquake and up to date and quite a big difference back in 2009 we were paying about two and a half grand and now from free sub July 22 april we 've been paying 7905 and between the years that you see five figures on the rent these were all from a straight community house was destroyed we were forced our birthright was forced to work from home and then move to a commercial office space in brown streak but it was really really hard on our part to shoulder that cause we say a community house because some partnerships there 's about twenty four organizations there and because it 's a Social Services Hub it 's easy for hours field workers and stuff to just go knock next door and ask some questions and get some support it has great facilities I encourage you if you haven 't been there yet please come and visit us and it 's warm it 's modern and just the like i 'm from the philippines and I 'm used to a lot of people and I I look for that the energy in there just people people everywhere in the offices it just gives you the boost and energy and just the moral encouragement and kaleen holy gel support that you gave staying at the Community House we believe bill helps build stronger communities it also gives us peace of mind like right now would be able to welcome and accept any donations that come in even though I block the door in our room someone will always be there to look after people even we 're not there it 's a peace of mind that you don 't have to worry about other operational costs because it 's all included security cleaning and other things that might you might people might think it 's small stuff but it 's all being a manager it 's all part of the big picture that you 're trying to not about every day in community house it 's it 's home for us birthright has been there for 22 years and like many of us and many of the families we work with we were also affected by the earthquakes and we were just so happy to be back at the Community House so birthright Christchurch strongly ask the council to please retain your financial support to the Christchurch community house thank you very much and thank you for what you do to opened the new community has so I 'm very familiar with the services helpful obviously not just for your organization but for all of the organizations that make it up is anyone got any questions Pauline I 'm just wondering how many tenants are in the community house now do you know about 24 really tested it 's good so going do come and go but when someone goes someone comes in yes yeah oh thank you yani um thank you for your presentation we 've heard comment concern that there 's no bus access to the community house so I appreciate your asking us for financial support for the community house do you think is a need for the community has to be more closer to the central city like near the bus interchange or on the bus interchange or in that kind of more there it was before or used to be yeah so it becomes more accessible and also do you think it needs to be bigger I guess like for our experience we have parents groups and they do come to the community has we acknowledge that there are issues on parking but there might be some more creative probably we could arrange a getting a lift from from people who was coming if they 're coming from say surely they could arrange pick up whoever comes in yeah but there are challenges but overall I think it 's still cost very cost efficient at abe 's our ideas and um you know we would tremendously impressed so I mean I think the number of us would wish that it was back where it was because there was the best location but you know it 's probably not well it 's not not able to be occupied at the moment because it 's still one of those empty sites i think so yeah there 's a long way to go before the city 's back on its feet in that regard but i may add we had a sewing group two Fridays ago and there was some mom we took two children like under five and they came on the bus ya taifa yeah it 's quite a way from in chester street I mean it 's it is quite a long way down let 's go straight isn um you know I mean if we had charge of the bus routes maybe we could expect problem as well but look thank you very much so there 's no question that the council 's been a longtime supporter of the community trust and house the house and will continue to produce why so thank you very much you very much _"

    "text": "anchored an errand right Ian boon from the Delta trust good afternoon death no person on to distribute some yes assembly will come down and do it thank you my name is Ian Boone I 'm with the delta community support trust I 'm here to speak today to the proposed going forward decreases to the community funding and the strengthening community fund as noted by the 24 able ramata submission to presentations before I 'll just give you a brief sense of who we are and what we do first and so you give us a sense of how we have its impact on others and my relationship to it we 're a medium-sized social service non-government organization focused on building caring communities and we provide services to 4,000 odd disadvantaged people each year including intellectually disabled to whom we provide intellectually social and recreational activities including a infamous disco which attracts people from across the city we also work with isolated older adults and providing a day service which brings about 65 members and things people in daily to that service as well we also want a range skills development low-cost community meals empowerment courses and a food bank in doing this we employed 20 or people and over 10 full-time equivalents and we receive support from 60 volunteers we 're really key to who we are and what we do we receive funding from 30 different sources which we found is really helpful when things go up and down and various places is kind of like the stock market if you have all your stocks in one place it doesn 't work but um if you can spread it a bit that kind of helps and we see about six percent of our income very generously form Council and we are very grateful for the continued investment of counsel in the people of Christchurch through the work we do over the years we in some ways are like a load we I 'll give you an example of someone whose details I fictionalized a little bit an East Asian woman called Peng who came was at home with very limited English and very limited ability to connect with her community she came across our cultural worker and basic things that you expect from any normal p we play group in terms of parenting skills and connection with other mothers in the area mainly but also on tour to English skills and built up your confidence over time those skills have increased the point where she is now taking a leading role in that group and she 's also moved into our other services and works in our kitchen as a volunteer this is someone who 's moved from being reasonably marginal to our society to know is contributing actively in what is happening and we see ourselves has been like a vote a form of social infrastructure to get the light of painful where she was to where we are so it can make all those kind of things heaven yeah so what you 've got in front of you is the cost to us of doing this kind of thing so the new line is how many contexts we had before the earthquake which is about 15,000 that dropped when the earthquake happened because we had to stop a number of our services and also because area and then that zooms up after the earthquake and has continued to grow so we are sixteen seventy two percent I 'm higher in terms of the services we are providing since Perez Greg and the red line is our income over that period which grew with some of the additional earthquake funds which were available from various sources since then but is now dropping off as those things develop as those things are less available but as of course the contacts encrypt continue to climb our problem is is that obviously like any business we can 't continue to do this forever and I suppose I 'm just appealing to you to consider that when you are looking at the proposals to remove the funding to organizations like ours across the city over the next four or five years i suppose what i 'm saying is that someone like ping is a like a well-oiled motorcycle going across our road and getting to where she needs to go and that 's little damage or costs words obviously we need to run programs like that but we also have multiple addictions gambling drug and alcohol who come and smash up our walls and vomiting our toilets and if we aren 't here some of providing social infrastructures would carry some of those people I suggest some of those people are going to end up in your forms of social infrastructure native libraries and is going to impact not only on the people in those situations but other citizens of this of the city as well it 's all I 've got to say thank you for your time any questions no think you know I should have said from the outset but I but I 've kind of assumed that everyone knows that it was a mistake that the two percent cap went through the strength and community council so it wasn 't it wasn 't intended but everyone who 's come along who has submitted who 's who 's known that have used it as an opportunity to say we should be increasing the funding so so I 'm going to take yours as a request to increase the funding and the I kind of want to because six percent six percent so that it 's not a sustainable eschew you know but for us you know like so what we want to do and the reason that we decided not to apply the blanket across this fun was that we 've set up a group to look at the the purpose of and in the mechanisms for and our contribution as rate payers of the city because you know people often think about you know council money has been counseled money but it 's not it 's you 're collecting money off the rating base of Christchurch to support those who are amongst the probably most vulnerable and and there are a number of people who sort of kind of say well wouldn 't it wouldn 't it be better if the funders work together and actually created a mechanism for funding organizations that was more sustainable and and that 's what we 're looking at it at the moment in terms of community resilience so that 's that that 's the framework for the discussion that we 're going to be having but i 'd be approach because to me you know sort of hand and you know handing you know taking a handout every year there 's not a sustainable way for an organization that 's got numbers like that yeah operate yep I mean that sounds absolutely wonderful I mean I have heard talk of it for a while but it actually could come to pass and the council as a major player in the Serie would have considerable influence on that would be it would be great can I just clarify the funding point for i understand it hasn 't been the two percent cut across the board yeah but what I was hearing and what I 've heard it elsewhere is that while the the funds are going up this year that they 're likely to decline over the next three or four years is that correct it 's not III think that what happened was that there was a genuine ear amazed that the standard cat was applied across the the the funds and that wasn 't intended it certainly didn 't pass the activity management lens approach so that 's organization but you know I I am serious thinking to do it was positive feedback anyway about the proposed approach which is to look at a more holistic way of funding we have all really moved I thank some funding contracts 23 years so that 's which is good are you in that group no we 're not you 're not all right okay and the other one but then six percent of your funding I minutes that is a minor part of your funding needs it is better to all configured heard all contributes at all heads up yeah okay I 've fell Thank You yin and clearly was a big organization and with a wide catchment pretty across the city you just tell it like and I 'm enter estimates your agency works with some of the others and also the struggle around affordable homes but particularly for those at the very end of the scale as you say a really disadvantaged or highest need we 're for example people don 't have a home so other hell is that work sort of going for you we 've paid out insurance and will be rebuilding and so we have considered the social housing option what we tend to find that though is that the scale of what is being looked at by government agencies is just vastly beyond what is sensible for us to participate in so yeah I mean I think we 'd be open if a consortium of large NGOs were to approach us and save you will be part of this but it 's not something that we can really afford to focus on thanks you Yanni um thank you it really strikes me that you 're in that kind of area of the city that as the central city has been called and off in buildings demolished that a lot of the needs have just kept going east and I just wanted to check if if you think there 's a need for council do some sort of social impact assessment in terms of the earthquake recovery in terms of the proposed developments in the central city and what impact that will have on on your community I 'd be open to it I I don 't want you to be using money unnecessarily either but yes I mean we are facing more need and I suspect there are more people coming to as well it 's just it 's just a little hard to actually sit down everybody and say well where did you come from a wider can come today to actually know where they 've come from if you know I 'm saying that in terms of things like that eastern frame and the impactor that has shutting off roads for example what foster street a whole bunch of finances are proposed I 'm sorry I mean I think you know I know I know that you 've got a point that you want to make anything but a cent a question to put to us I represented at the Delta trust who is doing my little sort of their hard work is unity really really well I 'm and I know what I dissipated to do really really well as well I always think so used to represent yeah to let him ask where to bibley park and now going very question everything you 've you 've asked me that there should be a what was it as a social impact study done on decisions that relate to the east frame on the needs we hear that this housing crisis we hear that groups have got huge needs than previously with her that is no big no increased matter well ignore the reference to the east frame do you think that the council should be itself conducting a needs analysis around the impact of developments in the in the city I don 't know I suppose the the major issue that we 're seeing from housing at the moment is with a lot of people working with their winters rather than owners and they are being pushed out to get renting done and have difficulty adjustment to get root repairs done here is done and then an excellent board to come be and that 's going back at 80 because the rink goes right out of the and other I 'm out of the area or move into even further socks and a thong accommodation that kind of thing so it and I suspect that 's not the council 's primary ambit I suspect that 's a wider government issue it is a wider government issue but we should be we should be involved in that you 're quite right look thank you very much much appreciated and I 'm glad that we were able to give you a good response on one issue anything they died thank you _"

    "text": "the next one is Citizens Advice Bureau Neil Lancaster and Molly health hello Neil I haven 't seen you for ages not for several weeks no we used to debate the location of schools in the eastern part of Christ we did indeed thank you for having us here wearing different hats today under the chair of the board of Citizens Advice Bureau in Christchurch and I 'd like to start off by talking about the second part of our submission and then relate back to the first this isn 't an attention-seeking device but I think the second part is is the pool of the point that we really are really critically involved in and that we want to be working with you in the development of long-term plan for Christchurch and particularly in the location of libraries and service centers and our place in that world in Christchurch last year we had 13,400 contacts to us either by phone or by people coming in and requesting our services we will give advice and help to people on any issue that they raised with us frequently we always ask we get the reply I 've always known about you I think that says something about the work that we do we 're a highly trusted brand we are recognized not only in New Zealand but in the United Kingdom and Australia we are totally independent we won 't accept funding from other organizations or we won 't accept funding or Sydney from the City Council we won 't accept funding from commercial organizations which might imply that we 're getting some gain from them and so our impartiality and working with people in the community is really critical throughout New Zealand citizens of ice bureaus are located in libraries and service centres it 's the place where people know that we are since the earthquakes that situation hasn 't happened to the same extent in Christchurch and in the long-term planning for where the city is going we would like to see our being included in the planning particularly for the new Central Library for the lynnwood library and also for the new hornby service center and library which are planned we need space where we can meet with clients we run justices of the Peace clinics we run free legal advice services we have the potential to run budgeting services and a range of other services in our community and so having that the recognized space to be able to do that is really important so that relates to that the second point in our submission the first point as i said is our our place in Christchurch and in New Zealand and the respect that is there is for us as a totally independent body and the ongoing work that we 've been doing in Christchurch over the past three years has certainly we 've we 've gone from place to place I guess to some extent we are in the island service center which is an ideal physical location within a building for us but it 's not our high priority need in Christchurch certainly we are moving into the east is our priority and we 're just negotiated a two-year deal which might fit in nicely with your planning with cpit to take over there their Student Health Services Building on Barbados Street which gives so looking further on that 's where would like to be with you in the the library in the city in lynnwood and also at jambe i 'm sorry i 've only used for minute you know no that 's great I mean I mean no I couldn 't agree more that Citizens Advice belongs with our library service I mean it just doesn 't it doesn 't make sense otherwise our Linwood library at the moment is an escape mall yesterday have you thought about going on there long long negotiations the present library doesn 't doesn 't work largely because of our confidentiality requirements sitting in the foyer of the library with people who may be yeah distressed or upset about their situation isn 't it didn 't work we 're now Vicki and I are on to the Aviva site now which is next door but when we 've met with what was the thinking about that earlier in the year yeah and the the other site within the health the health built the house within the building quite frankly is beyond our financial means to service several years where we as a voluntary organization with annual funding we something is aboard can 't_''_305.48 do that but it yeah cuz I it would be really good yeah okay well boil it that gives us food for thought and different ways as well so Andrew Yanni Jimmy thank you now just relation in relation to your request that we designate 60 square metres of purpose-built space in the rebuilt libraries I 'm just interested in getting a little bit more information about the work that 's already going on in hornby Pendleton and South library the the numbers of interactions that you have with people there and the kind of interactions you have you know clearly is something that you 're saying is working effectively there if we were to expand this it will be good just to get some more information partially effectively nationally two-thirds of our contacts are people who walk in in Christchurch and one-third is by phone in Christchurch those figures are reversed two-thirds of our contacts or by phone and one-third are walking our aim is to be where people are because we when they 're sitting in talking to us and many of the people who contact us have been given a runaround by a government department and they want to talk to someone and so being where people are and being able to be in that situation where people can come and talk to us this is really important what we deal with consumer issues family separation the whole family died make things employment issues are becoming increasingly significant mbie regard our workplace data on Iran our cabinet website as is the best in New Zealand so we do a lot of employment issues we also deal with what am I missing we deal with the whole range of issues but primarily I think the most important thing is to think about us as a one-stop shop where you can actually talk to a person and and have that person point you in the right direction where you need to go the other point important point I 'd like to make is there 's a really good benefit for us to being in the libraries and that librarians can refer people so there 's a really good synergy for the actual staff there when they 're dealing with people where it falls outside the boundaries or the criteria of their role and that 's where we can step in and add value to being in there well we have a venal tonry we 've taken over the community constable half of the people from service center physically is really good that there are two rooms right at the entrance of the building it 's very clear we at where we are a model I think that it works best that I 've seen in New Zealand is it mount albert where the Auckland City Library has the Citizens Advice Bureau in the center of the building library staff say Citizens Advice Bureau being he is fantastic it brings people into the library who wouldn 't normally come in here and see a B says boxes says the same thing in the opposite direction because we are we are here on the library people come and see us Yanni um thank you I appreciate the work that you do obviously the challenge the space that we need in our libraries little line make provision for other community groups have you talked to Sarah about the the buildings that they own in the central city around the need for some community space because it seems to me that our financial pressures massive and I just kind of wondered if you 'd thought about the central city or whether you 're more looking at just going into bourbon here is I mean you 've mentioned our library and then the other question I had was just accepting that you provide a unique service but recognizing that we 've got a whole bunch of other community groups that have all got facing increased rent cuts to funding lack of government support they 've all got the same needs have you thought about having a kind of shared community corner space so it 's not just you but it 's possibly other groups can also use that space so your questions to the first one hour prior it is to be where people are and so I mean the lynnwood east gate area is I think absolutely we 've actually done a lot of the acceleration which we 've tried to thinking about previously sorry do you want to say something upstairs apart and oh yes we spoke to Aviva and they were looking i think it was correct me if i 'm wrong knew it was sixteen thousand piano that 's what i was going to come to you how much is the girl in the reeds that would be required to actually go into that more space yeah that depends on our the funding that we get him a yearly basis and the other part of the issue was they were wanting to lock us into a tomb when we 're only funded year by year and financially that wasn 't a viable option for a board so you have been brought into the contracts that that go more than one year you know okay well then we need this that 's something and they thought it was silly thousand a year was it I think off the top of my head it was six or six years yep yeah kick it I 'm today not even finished yet getting in our biology so the other way this is the temporary Recovery Authority that the government 's either a place that you 've looked for for a permanent home although because the temporary is and what was the other question I wasn 't thing just temporary of syrah I mean they own the bus interchange you know but they 're not gonna own it forever they 're not gonna be we don 't but no no they 're not gonna be here through that yelling yeah I sincere now I 'm just trying to understand if there 's anywhere else that you 've looked at in the city and that 's right if it 's just the library fine the other question was around the community corner concert so it wasn 't just your organization but I won 't_''_668.48 we shared space amongst other we we have we have been working with community law Canterbury and that was a strong possibility until they got the residential advisory service contract rolled over on they have no space and the other spaces like we 've looked so we 're going to I think that take out from here is that we need a little bit of work done on the submission Jimmy I just want to know because my understanding before the earthquake regarding to the suburban area you have used honda honda library beach out there library a set of very successful however in central city actually use here with some other long-term and agency in the kind of community house it 's because they have the kind of early volunteer or they have a condo tenants protection association so more people you know crime they might have a tool a one place one occasion when facility can get a many the service but up Oscar a moment there the other facilities still open to the community I just want to know whether why you particular story for in Central City in the library facilities rather than community house well we 're community house is currently located is at least a 10 minute walk from the bus exchange many of our volunteers are mature shall I say and many of them have health issues there got another ten minute walk to get there as well so it 's about accessibility for a volunteer base which is one of the issues that we have with community house being a viable option for us yeah the same issue replies applies to our clients for sleep yeah no I mean I agree with you i mean i think that the location is unfortunate in that regard yeah anyway thank you very very much not appreciate it good to see you thank you okay _"

so anyway you 've got me and I thought really my college secret weapon and we 're women Howie me Asia absolutely so for those of you who don 't know us i 'm denise smith and this Israeli cane we 're from to party Roy Mata trust a neighborhood community development organization sit in the inner city east and learn what area of town once we Leanne used to soothe as they are in p many years ago she said we are going to be slightly more dryer I guess I 'm afraid and we realize that 's not the best time almost two o 'clock for being a slight little drier and then what we want to say but we want to look at the I guess the plan and we want to look at the financial strategy and we then want to look at some specifics so to be earthquake sequence which began in late 2010 has presented Christchurch with complex and challenging issues which demand far-reaching decisions that will shape the city for future generations especially if we are to not only recover but more particularly regenerate and emerge as a green livable assessable sustainable and equitable city you know it 's not going to be done overnight and to do so demands accurate up-to-date information and a thorough understanding and assessment of our current situation it is in deeply concerning to us that the proposed plan has adopted such a bold approach to resolving the extensive financial shortfall faced when considerable uncertainty and significant key facts are still not knowing making planning very difficult all in order to reach the legislative requirements of local government debt christchurch unlike other local authorities is far from being in a business as usual position for the council to be forced to forge ahead without knowing the full cost of their appear study infrastructure services and facilities the full extent of the insurance proceeds and what other financial assistance that could be available to the city just to meet what could be possible for the rebuild to quote a Fokker Toki translated into English only the wise and dark when the sea is calm to us the sea is still too unpredictable and so n stormy to begin such a journey or such magnitude so we firmly believe the recovery and regeneration of the city would be better served by deferring the long-term plan until much more of effects or non-use the annual plan processes in the meantime to make necessary adjustments and immune lence by encouraging you to make a strong case to government that the rebuild of Christchurch will be jeopardized if we are forced to follow the local government requirements now and we believe it 's unrealistic to be expected at this stage of the recovery to return a balanced budget end by throwing away the usual consultative processes used for a long-term plan prices and replace them and stared with a community leader approach that enables conversations to be head of all levels which are Nate to enable all people to be engaged to develop collectively what we want for our city not seek to reliance on an economic lead post recovery model which assumes the economy will be stimulated through the building of anchor projects and the job creation which follows and the belief that this will create a flow-on of money that will benefit everyone victor search such an approach is aimed at the hopes and aspirations of the advantaged who had the discretionary money to go to the cafes and bars spend money and shops at in paying events and take advantage of the bank big anchor projects it assumes that Christchurch 's are wealthy city but are we seems as data tells us a half of the city earns less than 30,000 annually one-third love and rental housing a quarter of our children live in poverty we does the average Kiwi foot and this model Mary Richardson and her former role as executive director of the Christchurch Methodist Mission at a local conference and 2013 questioned who 's the city worthy are anchor projects going to improve and then cautioned that disasters have a way of reasoning socially Konerko inequalities come and see where we were we see it every day lead recovery models Kobe is an example sadly the pursuit of a one-dimensional model flies in the face of the council 's proud tradition of developing strategies and policies which promote social justice equity and fairness and the building of strong communities and the promotion of well-being and participation we note that was very real concern that the financial strategy being proposed is not informed or linked to relevant community related strategies and we lost them and our submission but particularly the strengthening community strategy or even Sierra 's recovery strategy for Christ 's Church of which the council is a partner nor is there any reference to the treaty Oh to a treaty based approach so our submission sets out some very real concerns about the financial strategy we are heartened however to learn that the strengthening communities fund will not be subjected to the blanket to bethink cuts imposed on the council 's operational budget we thank you for this but we do want to highlight some concerns while there is a slight increase in this year 's budget largely we know rates remotion budget being solid and overall increase and funds allocated when you look to the amounts up to 2018 19 financial year analyzed instead we are seeing a continued downward trend and grant monies available 2019 financial year 10 million point seven three million to and 2018 6.63 million so not only I guess are the grants keeping pace with rising costs but social services or community agencies as expected to do more with less our submission then builds the case for the need for increased monies to be made available to community lee grass root development organizations and communities and i guess we want to highlight the fact that the value get as a council on your investment is enormous we also note that there is a need for an equity based approach to allocating community funding so that recognition has given to the fact that in some Ward 's they are less advantaged than others which leah forward seduced increased resourcing for those areas and lastly we strongly advocate the need for the long-term plan to embrace the strengthening community strategy so that principles of justice equity and a treaty based approach can calling yeah I 'm going to just summarize my summary here for Christmas not with timely some specific things that come out and a half ago very low income community there is concern that there is the possibility even though it 's not actually in the plan there 's been news about it so not quite sure whether it 's come from about cuts to community arts funding media arts funding is am located in our community in the lynnwood community art center there 's a critical part of social well-being and what I want to I want to flag that if there is some intention to look at that that they 're not happened in terms of the community facilities in the appendix of the plan work openly with the communities before you do anything about this especially but not only in the east and pay particular attention please to the paddling pools they 're critically important to low-income families it 's not petanque but paddling is important consider a sliding scale for the increased fees around cemeteries that 's critically important to Maori in other ethnic communities and could be applied as it could to the proposed sports facilities and we are pleased that there is a proposal for it what a thought of that work Paul in lynnwood and whilst and we 're pleased about that but we 're concerned that it might be too expensive for a lot of our residents so we want that thought about as well and in terms of housing we really endorse that council is going to support housing recovery and we as part of another trust that we have are involved in building play arm houses in the inner city that the council has supported us with we 'd like to see that continue we 'd like to see the council thinking about joining PABs with government to look at how private landlords might be support supported to rebuild some of their very low cost bitsat type accommodation in the inner city and we 're thinking about things like suspensory loans or some kind of mechanism that could support that recovery and directly address the many people that do not have anywhere to live and we 're thinking particularly of I 'll stop you run out of time yes and look thank you very much for your submission I think that one of the issues that you 've raised it right at the very outset asks us to do something that we can 't legally do so our our exemption from holding a long-term plan I 'm sorry yonni there the exemption from holding a long-term plan as a council ends on a 30th of june this year so we don 't get to not do this process we could potentially ask government for the extension to the thirtieth of September but that 's it and that doesn 't actually get us over the line so what we 've been saying to groups is work with us absolutely and I totally agree with the approach that you 've adopted totally agree I couldn 't agree more but we 're going to have to have some of these conversations after the first of July and we have to get this LTP across the line that 's why we 're presented it as a base case and not as the final position plan process next year will be substantial I smiled at the beginning of your introduction because it 's what I wanted us to apply for last year which was the delay for this year to be an annual plan so that we could actually do a proper long-term plan afterwards but it was not to be and those that didn 't agree with me know who they are so we are in this position because we 're in this position and we cannot now get out of it so by the 30th of June we have to have a long-term plan and place because by law no council can operate without one so I 'm sorry that that 's the that 's the reality but what you 've asked for from this council there is not one councillor around the table who doesn 't agree that we should be planning the future with our communities and exactly the way that you 've described and that 's what we want to achieve okay so thank you very much _"

    "text": "afternoon everyone I 'm a siege on target this is andrew friendly if everybody was so walking different but if I 'm meeting up with different people this I know that 's right bad anyway thank you for hearing our submission it 's a very simple proposition would be very short and sweet like to get things started with a little exercise for you mayor so Leanne I 'd like you to pick a thumb oh I 'll town come on I 'll go put weight one belief one no the other one okay my left hand one bring it by my back now LeeAnn mixing it up which hands it in oh I think I think it might be in your li flood this one yeah let 's have a look okay so that exercise a bit like post-earthquake political decision-making sometimes you just can 't win okay today we 're pleased to propose we relate to that I know you can I know 350 submissions that 's pretty tough to go through anyway there 's more than 100 now oh my goodness okay good luck and we 're for them because there are four winners the City Council the Christchurch ratepayers the Hagley Park and Christchurch petanque club so buried deep in the draft long-term plan is a line which proposes the City Council repairs our current clubhouse in hagley park it 's a building that 's constructed 1945 now structurally unstable unsafe to enter it is eleven percent of the current building code it 's pretty bad the cost to repair in 2012 was estimated at six hundred and fifty thousand dollars now that that has since risen our proposal is for you to demolish the building provide us with a clear site on which we will build a new architectural redesign pavilion with a little model here Andrew might like to take that round it 's a contemporary structure that would definitely enhance the site which is planned to be opened up to Lake Victoria under a new landscape plan the good news is we 've got funding in place for the new building so the only cost to the city council would be the demolition of the existing building this is sounding good we wrap letters I 'm saying this gives you six hundred and fifty thousand good reasons to support our proposal what 's the demolition cause I we 're not aware of that so I don 't know I can 't comment on that okay not sure so two thumbs up again that 's what we want from you guys oh it 's actually it 's actually in the central city recovery plane Reimer doesn 't it it loads the five avenues as the remit so we might be able to find someone else who first oh why I have a feeling we got told of the committee that is an economical right off last week I don 't think it 'd be economical it might be an economic right off right off Dave Dave you wouldn 't have an idea of how much that building would cost demolished watching well we could get some advice on it um I mean we won 't be making the decision here now no I realize that look I know the building really well I mean I used to be the MP for Christ 's it than before I was crushed geez and and I used to go to the RSA and Bowling Club clorium you know regulate for the opening and closing of their seasons given the odds speech there as well here you know you should have gotten Taylor to do then we could have just watched it yeah Wow and so this is all eco-friendly this is all solar panels and I 'm Charlie panels unless you want to contribute you don 't have to the pays for itself and yeah it is a timber-frame building double glazed that it 's certainly up to today 's standards a very attractive looking building obviously it would have to go through all the various consents but it I think will really look good and fit for purpose the advantage of having this is that also contemporary structure is that we can attract or have a better chance of attracting younger people into the sport we are the biggest petanque club in New Zealand I personally have coached the New Zealand team the last two World Championships we 've got the current New Zealand singles champion a dozen current or former New Zealand internationals yeah alright so we 're thriving club yep any other questions he 's giving you getting a thumbs up for you lonsdale all right no no oh yeah knee is that as it listed as a heritage building on any lists 1945 know they had a heritage people have had a good look at it and now it was originally a single-story building at a later stage they put the alley for the top floor on it it 's pretty ugly um no they 'd hit the behavior be nederland club in the country Eureka we are going to reuse the foundation stone assuming this all goes ahead and we 've already repaired the flagpole we 've replanted a memorial oak that had died because you know the membership of the bowling club was down to 12 12 and they amalgamated with United swear in hagley in that sense call itself mmm ok and just um have you talked to any of the groups that are often critical of things happening in hickory park and just to get its itself whether they support of it no no I 'm thinking yannis referring to the hands of higley group we say the hands off Hagley group Belgium land they pave quite a significant role of wrap around the the cricket oval and my discussions with the DHB because we 've done a land swap our dhb is the DHB said that we can with hands off Hagley is way better than not working with them so we certainly be happy to talk to them I would see you 're increasing the footprint and we 're actually lowering the height I know and and and that would be hugely positive and when you when you said would you know immediately my heart saying because it 's it 's I mean it looks more modern for the environment then I would become full worth and but would absolutely works on it if I do well we certainly will speak to them I don 't know it 's any more contemporary than the new visitor center no no no I I have a view on that too but I wasn 't around ok fell thank you council are going to be establishing like a I 'm not a guardian a good of Guardian so heavy pack but more like an advisory group for hagley park or so that 's it be good to talk with you about there too so my question isn 't like you 've got another hand or card to play where you might want to build it climbing wall as well John no we 're not planning on putting a close cater I 'm saying it because John is great at building clothing or stupid right ok dad Tim I just want to say thank you you know you 've got done a whole lot of work you 've got the money together the new one all you 're asking us to do is assist with you to clear the site yea and perhaps at some other bits and pieces we did get a presentation from no can 't remember that the journalist David that the committee with regards to solar so I think they 've picked up to open your mind and hear the possibilities would be great but I 'm very uh I 'd go I 'd go gonk gonk google google the google the powerwall announcement by Tesla no seriously seriously thank you John is pretty good yes the world is changing and our dependency on various heating means and what will change very rapidly very rapidly well it may not be here yet Bucky but it 's on its way yeah well the north-facing roof yeah is ideal it is absolutely I only opposition yeah all right I mean you might actually be able to power the visitor center at the same time well yeah but well you know but it 's gonna come it 's gonna come anyway thank you very much very very Russian um you know yeah we do appreciate the amount of effort that you 've gone to thinking _"

    "text": "hi Holly me to me yeah yeah you heard that conversation didn 't use it was quite entertaining I told you get that reaction so I trust that you 've all read the submission it 's all about this building in the heart of akaroa in the heart of our business district in how historic area this is what it looked like before the earthquakes it 's been closed off for the last four years unfortunately what we call the service center or our old post office previously it has the a corolla information services and postal services and the council office and my office upstairs I 'm the marketing manager for a Corolla and the bays and I work for after our district promotions we are the marketing body where the Business Association and the district tourism organization we work very closely with Christ Church in temporary tourism he is a pariah district promotions ran the information center in akaroa till it was bought out by Christ Church in Canterbury tourism in 2007 since then they have run the information services in akaroa unfortunately since everybody was kicked out go and pay market read for an Information Center and have since closed down because it wasn 't economically viable solar sat timber they closed down and we now have a privately-run Information Center in 1993 archaria district promotions lobbied the New Zealand government for a funding grant to purchase this building the the in minister of tourism mr. John Banks gave a grant of a hundred and ten thousand dollars for the community and for a pro district from to purchase this building to be used primarily for information services and postal services and an office floor there was being the banks peninsula District Council at the time John Banks acknowledged the strong link between the historic area and a pariah and how historic heritage and the tourism promotion the building itself is a hundred years old and this year it had 73 thousand dollars worth of earthquake strengthening at the time it was purchased it is a hundred percent of code it had funding allocated for its repair since 2013 it is listed on the historic list and it is a notable building in the council district plan an integral part of akaroa fifty percent of our employment rely directly or indirectly on our tourism and you also know that we have been the main port for the cruise ships to be coming into a grower to the last five years we have seen more than half a million people coming through akaroa so our information services are vital our postal services are also vital to our community as well it 's really important that council give the financial support to allow our information services to go back into this building I have been working remotely for the last four years so it 's the building clothes out of the upper our toy library it 's not exactly ideal by providing a free space from which to operate will ensure the ongoing economic success of the postal and information services in akaroa we believe that the upper our Information Center privately-run now is doing a istic drive and has great staff but the space that they have currently is far too small for our needs we are not asking for anything more than what we had before the support our information and postal services and an office for the marketing person to go back into their space we need to maintain the same standard and level of service now as before the earthquakes the historic 1915 post office building should remain in public use and ownership preferably as a postal service information service and an office for the marketing person this needs to be for the foreseeable future for the benefit of all ratepayers and the visitors to our town council needs to support this fully can I can I just who owns the building I couldn 't figure that from the submission um so it 's a council-owned building but had has been funded by a grant from the New Zealand government but it 's in nineteen I was purchased by Christchurch and Canterbury tourism in 2007 is that not the building yeah that 's just a service information center they purchased the service they didn 't that 's why I got horribly confused so have you made that thing no no no it 's good Andrew Thank You Holly for your own presentation this afternoon and your group but in wider community around the continued closure of this building you 're essentially asking for two things one of which is the continued public ownership of that building by council and the second is free space for the Information Center and the post office do you believe that long term there is a genuine threat that those facilities are those services wouldn 't continue to be provided if they continued having to pay a commercial rent and remain in the space that they 're in at the moment yes I do and also the space that they 're currently and is too small we are using the old post office building for our storage at the moment it 's full of brochures and boxes and things like that so we just throw the stuff in there because yeah it 's just been closed and unused but we we are really lacking all that valuable space for information you know brochures etc so so to answer your question it 's a bit be very very easy for a privately-run Information Center to clothe from one moment to the viable when as you know a pro is extremely seasonal we 're very already we 're extremely quiet we 've had a busy summer but now all of a sudden that 's just it 's deed in town again so it could be very easy for private run operations to say it 's not viable and where would we be without that so how much this has to be spent on fixing up to get it up and running again well it is when we went inside it when we went over at to revoke Aurora it is actually not much wrong with it as a hundred percent of coded head that seventy three thousand dollars earthquake strengthening the chimneys were taken down when I was no I I understand over there so you 're saying put it on the budget I don 't yeah I have no idea what the repair costs must have been costed David will know the answer to that question you stood up at the wrong time but tranche one 's good cuz it 's the first off two blocks yeah hemet yeah but but 're submitting that in favor of that remaining on budget absolutely absolutely and also requesting the free space for our information services to go back in there oh okay right that 's that 's the other element of it term and then yani um girls the free space the council business and the building to get it up and running we 've invested simulant thousand dollars prior to that free space do you think it would be fair to ask for a a rent of some kind just maintenance whatever given the upper our district promotions lobbied government for that funding grant initially to purchase that building I feel that it needs to be a free space for community but we 're kind of in the same procedure same situation we could be handed back a whole lot of projects but we 've got to actually run them it 's as dead as a burden to all right powers of Christ chips so I 'm just asking up so you feel that you don 't you should not have to pay for any rent whatsoever no that 's what I discussion with counsel regarding this if it required you know ongoing maintenance or some sort of long-term lease on the building then all that sort of thing would be considered Danny so as you 'll be aware through our consultation we 're saying to people clearly that many of our community facilities are underutilized and we don 't see the value in repairing or replacing them I think you 've made a case that it 's important to get this building reopen but I 'm struggling to understand if you 've had the most tourists that you 've ever had in the history of echo raya and you 've got cct pulling out its services how that justifies the need for this space so what what reason has been given for cct to pull out art when you 've got more tour than you 've ever had and how going forward can we ensure that we have some level of information being provided the reason why cct pulled out is because the privately-run Information Center opened and so it was a just a good excuse for them to pull out then having to pay market rent and a new building anyway so it just made economic sense I know they 're funding has been cut from council as well so you know it 's all having to be cut down the board they would not have clothes that information center down if the privately owned one hadn 't opened logical step to that question is if we reopen this building would cct come back and provide those services our privately run operator would would use it no cct would not economically it 's not viable for them to be running it ran at a loss it would be privately raises a few other questions but I 'll serve it for anesthetic yeah it does run a few pieces with a few are in a private organization and you open the same business is a say one run by council and in council can 't completely seems ridiculous but the count that the private one would not obvious it seems we 're not closed down because you must have been a reason and a need for a private enterprise to run why cct would it can be this private ones being run seemingly well sorry what 's the question to what I guess why would cct come back to a Corolla if you 've got a private visitor center that was running in parallel and it 's done very well because you it seems to have been ridiculously of two visitor centers one a public 11 progress you should canterbury tourism we work very closely alongside in a lot of areas i mean the information center was only a very small part of their operations I mean they promote Canterbury region including akaroa so a lot of the marketing is done hand in hand with them that information center was just a small part of their operations there are obviously doing a lot a lot of other marketing work with us is that aren 't you for sure yeah it 's about two million yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean abs but it isn 't ranch one the bigger issue is whether as a result of repairing it we can put on budget the cost of the rent that we wouldn know that 's a that 's a bigger issue than just repairing it which wasn 't yeah but anyway so that they 're all look that eschews that that you 've raised and you know I mean I understand it 's a beautiful building you know and I mean we felt going through that and actually we did feel really safe and sided it wasn 't it wasn 't a feeling of feeling unsafe and yeah we 've sort of felt that it was strange that it wasn 't up and running it all over again but I 'm take comfort from the tranche one tranche one sounds way better than tranche too and it means that it is going to happen so of will take on board your comments and obviously consider bait on the and the LTP process so thank you very much for coming over if I could invite _"

    "text": "oh go on smile I don 't know that you heard me but I said you don 't look like Linda so I think so no say who who are we who are we seeing today I 'm the president Ian Hunter and Paul is here to support it he can do the talking right thank you thank you Paul well first of all thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to the council you can sit down if you want to have to stand thank you very much no we want you to feel relaxed me too good the cat club began in nineteen sixty through a relationship with the council was it was put into a rubbish it up there and it has expanded three times since then but coming through to the present day the cap card can 't explain any further because of noise constraints and so the the essence of the cap clubs submission today is to ask the council to bring forward the funding that that it has got set aside for a relocation the car club is a great family rip on the track as in contrast to the operation of racing on the roads and things like that club have organized themselves and got a attract their the the car club has got a long-term lease with the council for about 30 years I haven 't got the exact figures here and you have great so either the club stays where it is and is constrained from growing or is relocated and they have purchased land subject to resource consent which they could relocate to that 's not necessarily a simple proposition but it is a ordinary development type proposition that where be purchased and I sorry I didn 't know that and the claims on right at the back of the airport sorry yes but that is well underway the Warriors have taken about a hundred thousand cubes out they used to make talking to them yesterday about another 400,000 could come out over the next 12 months and roughly basement that would be around the time when the whole would be ready so for those not a weird the basic idea is that the car club could be like an acoustic bun but even better and of course we could add buns around that as well so if we take a neat bottom floor level of 4 meters and then add to say five metre buns round you 're looking at effectively 9 meters of barrier around the outside so you know you could be looking at a situation where the club comes isolated from a noise perspective wow I 'm talking a marshal day the other day they 're strongly of the opinion that that that the noise issues would would be very acceptable from their point of view it 's um I mean that 's the issue isn 't it it 's very much the issue and I believe that the council has got an opportunity to there is one objector rightly so over there which is a Wildlife Trust quite famous and they have an objection around a park no there 's the Isaac Conservation Trust that have a diction to it yeah there 's a black sports but it 's my personal thing you 're not not the car clubs at Penn necessarily that resistant management procedures and have a single issue hearing around this the Wildlife Trust could be invited to make the presentations and and that you know the developers socially cut back their presentation the associate could be heard and resolved one way or another and then all the interested parties could then move forward after that to develop the site it 's that Ben has it been mooted as a it has in the last 48 hours the Wildlife Trust has it in their words and the first and since not agreed to that council staff probably haven 't had time to respond it would be my respectful submission that it 's not really a staff feeling decision because it represents a variation and typical processes normally you would develop the full concept but from my perspective if you spend all that money developing the full concept and the site 's not really viable for the silence unless you it 's a waste of money and an egg if you still like to just place a fairness a resource consent as a permission yeah so what my suggestion is that noise profile not the track not the building to just simply ask each other as would the council give this permission and the council really can 't really as conflicted because they have an interest through being the landlord but they could appoint an independent commissioner to hear this single issue which would then give everyone clear ear to either move forward or go back actually that 's quite interesting because when you think why you 're in the position that you run it 's actually the requirement to free up more land for residential development which is a direct result of the earthquakes so I would have I would have thought that a special procedure would actually fit with the the direction of the land use recovery plan for example I mean you 're the flow-on effect you 're not those you 're not the residential effect but but you know bluntly you had to move an order for the residential development to go on so what you 're suggesting actually sounds like something that we could promoters a as something through the current legislation as well I believe good innovation to consider another context and victory from from a developer 's point of view you often get into a situation where although you 've got a good hunch you 're going to succeed you know to convince bankers and other people to get on board you need a high level of certainty and to be able to isolate the key issues that are a barrier and in all fairness get those who 'd and get a decision while for your planning team might be a subtle amount extra of work it actually in the long run means they 're not going to be working through stuff that will never actually go ahead yeah it sums rookie focused in terms of the possible date by which you could shift to McLain 's Island site could you do that by first of September 2017 I believe that would be unrealistic without making adjustments to the quarry that quarry has suggested at 12 months on the inside we give 12 or 18 months to build after that i 'm running out of medical power but so now that being two and to win well as soon as possible but that 's more to feed into the things like the resource consent process but if you took that idea i suggested then I think you 'll drive the costs down remarkably because effectively you can remove the contentious issue and then if you get a permission on that or you issue a permission on that then everything else becomes unconscious and you should be able to develop it together a lot cheaply would that bring down the amount that like never mind about that process I put the other side because there are some flaws in their process but and would that bring down the cost that it would need to go in the budget for the relocation of the cars road kappa i don 't think is appropriate for the cat club to make a comment on the costs but I would be happy to say that I think that it does thank you don 't want to get fit neck ya know Walt I 'm even costs are an interesting thing aren 't they there 's a long way away full right of appeals or for instance then we need to know that and then obviously that would chase that might change the perspective on the site but can I just ask one more is there a plan B of that site is not available just from talking around Council I understand mr. Morra as interested in row a poner as an option no you got a plan B no we haven 't heaven oh yeah cuz I 'm what I mean there are two issues i 'm in at may or may not be a suitable site you know so if you don 't get it across the line even if you go through a different process then you you 're under all it happens is that you 've got to work out what plan B is a lot quicker then I 've got Jimmy and then fell it would be can I just see him in there would be a plan B because the people are acquiring and have got so much land out there they can put us if the problem is with the Isaac trust they possible but the time frame would take longer to Cory they 've got many hundred acres out there the quarry so they could shift us over so the numbers on that are if you use the figure of 600 metres difference between the Averys and the and the the the closest point of the track and we know from our knowledge around noise for the modeling on the track that residential development is allowed to about 400 metres 150 metres under certain circumstances so we think that the site the current location Marshall de think would be fine but if you move right to the far end of their holdings you 're looking at well over to case so you can see at that point that it really becomes a an ideological objection rather than one infected a possibility of getting late and I 've got a list of people to ask questions so Jimmy oh thank you thank you Mary I 'll require regarding to a funding you know if the like Isaac I mean there are the trusted a particular concern is a noise mitigation so Leah funding of four do you think whether you share you this kind of the fan the increase of council need to need you to consider I mean the location of the kind of chakra I don 't quite understand the question but if the question is is it the question that do I think that I think but they 're already already the council have repriced at it and substantially higher than 3.5 minutes Henry costed on I think that 's what that 's what Jimmy Chin 's said but we haven 't approved it no that 's right no that goes to council tomorrow factor yeah 1.com you know I think the done but goodnight is that if you look over the long term it 's not just about a bunch of guys driving carts around it 's about noise management for the whole city in the long term if you think about places like open we you 've got that racetrack right in the middle of you know even thing and that just the hassle of managing that I think if there is a good opportunity to move the be good that 's that 's about the city as a whole and I think that 's a point worth considering yeah but if the mines on is that I stay at the point that council chief was making and we may not have been but it would be the point i would make which is if you didn 't have a 30 odd year lease we wouldn 't be paying for it at all so that 's the that 's the issue so um you know it 's a it 's it 's kind of a trade-off which people are going to have to weigh up and fill thank you i can see how there 's some little baggage is full of the cat club and with this new location or proposed location so there are some issues though you refer to the noise issue I 'm just wondering and tues about being in an old quarry site and the area already been quarried have you other any reports available regarding safety of their cover in that area my my own research and to it is that they 're been some talk about whether there would be interaction with the planned irrigation scheme on the other side of the river but at the moment I think it would be be okay to proceed a little bit further until those reports have gotten so at the moment they 're only talking about 4 meters down whereas the resource consent for the quarry as some six or seven meters so be difficult to say that there will be a problem winner well you 'll be able to see the report and what reporting separate but we 've got you okay thank you well um thank you very much for your time I mean obviously well I 've really gone over a lot of time but since people are offended by my not allowing questions David no well is there anything I mean like that the the papers coming to council tomorrow say well I was just really interested in the the fairly extensive area of quarrying have you had any discussion with the quarry about sort of potential location in an area that would not be subject to noise issues with be there be our formal position that there is no issue here at what the proposed site but if we 're talking about managing conflict then thus the the issue is that the quarry has begun digging its war and it 's going to work back to the site that would have been ideal so it 's their own private interest issue here and I did sort of sale and he basically said well we 've already got started and when I work back so if we could find a business case to make it in their interest to start at the other end for instance being cheeky if Isaac 's wanted to dig out that quarry and start up you know you see the basic point if they got started the other end then we could go in after them there so I don 't think it 's too early but at the moment it 's it 's not really on the table technically but some solution might get up there and your point of sort of addressing noise issues well ahead of the city that 's great but 30 years ago too but then so caught up with him well i think you know that 's great cities grow it 's good and I hope this one does too yeah thank you very much and I appreciate you coming here today if I could invite _"

    "text": "looking at this so okay bright well so we 'll get underway and I 'm just various councils are actually in the room but Pauling was here before and so was reef so anyway but will get underway and I 'd like to start off by inviting the textile and fiber arts network Juliet Devlin to come forward and you 've got someone else with you as well and please please feel free to sit down yeah yeah we 're very welcoming on got it really thank you everything rosie up thank you sorry I 'm Judy Devlin from the pigsty low fiber arts network and this is our Secretary rods McCarthy oh one of this stuff hello great thank you and our group is an umbrella group for 10 textile related related groups with the objectives of promoting and supporting local textile groups to increase anticipation facilitate collaboration fundraise research and plan for a shared textile and fiber arts venue and we have circulated our brochure which was published by some advertisers that worked and partnership with they funded it I had three topics to speak to the first support of the Arts voice submission that arts funding should be maintained in hopefully increased as part of the long-term plan and not just for the existing higher profile performance arts but for new organization 's activities and initiatives that arise during the rebuild and we we fit into that letter group we see any decrease in arts funding to be a really backward step we feel that the arts and whatever shape or form are what makes Christchurch a special place to live we retiring or visit and the arts have never been more relevant and contribute to the special character about our city creative pursuits the rewards we give ourselves for the daily grind whether it 's attending a performance or in our case creating a woven quilted embroidered or knitted item we also make a general comment and support this also came out of the ants for its meeting and supported the of the new community arts and events unit about to be established at the City Council and we support the proposal that was briefly discussed that arts related fundings currently scattered across community support strategy new unit our second topic is bringing people together and we firmly believe that creative activities strengthen social networks that breaks down cultural age and other barriers and reduces socialize and isolation especially for those living alone and older people and these social benefits contribute to a healthy community and an enjoyable quality of life the Arts bring people to our city in our case our member groups are some of our member groups are large enough to organize national conferences and there are two planned for 2017 a growth in population due to an aging demographic will increase interest and participation and the creative and other arts this increase in population needs to be taken into consideration as part of the long-term plan and as another reason why arts funding should not be cut our third topic relates to our own group that text on fiber arts network meeting space for larger community arts crafts and other growth groups despite the large number of community facilities managed by the City Council there is a lack of larger meeting space for groups of sixty to a hundred who have special need full-time use of the rooms as well as meeting space for those who meet weekly monthly etc the additional needs of our groups are storage space for libraries and equipment parking etc sharing meeting space and resources would be hugely beneficial for these groups while those of our groups affected by loss of venues have found adequate mini meeting venues we still have one large group Canterbury embroidery gold membership 140 who need full-time use of a venue we are prepared to work in partnership with any large community group to lease at community rates modify or build such a venue that is our long-term goal we ask that as part of the City Council long term plan that lend or unused facilities be set aside for new community initiatives for groups such as ours who are too large for existing community facilities in are prepared to partner with any other large community groups towards the shared goal so to summarize for the long-term plan that the city council maintain or increase funding for the Arts in thinking beyond the high-profile performing arts and in consideration of the increased seek more recreational opportunities and secondly that the city council make provision for new initiatives in regard to lend or unused facilities for large community groups and thank you for the opportunity to make the submission to the plan and hopefully we 'll be able to answer any questions love it Thank You Becky Yanni thank you for your submission and just to to suggestions have you spoken to the people who are currently looking for groups who want to meet at the new temple at the whole school library facility no and that 's probably because our problem we can introduce you and and secondly the philipstown community hub I have tried to follow up with the strengthening communities coordinate coordinator Shapira human partner i think her nomas but I hip hip no reply from here so should we get you a reply back on that because that 's obviously an opportunity that 's digitally when I 've been trying to follow through but she must be a very busy lady yep Mary said what yep Yanni and then tell I mean I think flux town is a really need to think about the permanent yes and we need to look at the priorities in terms of the money going into sport and two other arts creative sectors versus almost nothing for the community sector in the central yeah yeah we feel very as part of our group coming together was to raise the profile of these many community groups that are still battling on and tiny Churchill 's when I reflect on the history I think of the old creme I 'm sorry Peter Boris Intel and I think I would for wheat or ones and they were different little groups yeah it is correct and so you 've lost that the Art Center used to have a number of growth regard lost there yes has it been anything in the central city that either Sarah or the council have offered nothing no we did have very close liaison with Natalie cadenhead from Sarah unfortunately she 's passed away because they have all these properties in the South frame yeah it just seemed like a really good opportunities for maybe part of your crew should also could also to find some of those venues I just the final question for Italy team pre to I want to me on it yes but I 'm the bus interchange with having somewhere in the central city even if it had some sort of car parking restrictions but having this sort of creative activity around something like a bus interchange would that work for you or do you need more space and simply the car parking is a major problem yeah we really would love somewhere just outside the four main avenues you know like sudden ton wilston Linwood 's and albans Phillipstown yeah somewhere that just accessible by bus but not not in the central city because you know when we have been groups meeting we we could have to if we had our own facility that could be two or three groups there or a workshop and a group and we 've just got to put hip to have some parking hey don 't be great we have looked at christchurch exchange it 's not quite big enough he has community house no we have done much feels free we sort of inversion and village only one year but one space she had spare yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that 's some Pig space it 's a three groups no well I mean I don 't yet anyway any open it our fill thank you most of my crease has been answer is the locations where you know where you need pasilla t but just it just seems to being like an upsurge and interest and involvement in one ear of ticks all and 511 fiber arts yeah well there was a big fallen membership because initially because so many people were dealing with their own situations but that 's really built up and i mean i 've been a member of my guild for 16 years and we 've had a thirty percent increase over that time and members and i think that 's part of the aging population as well yeah exactly yeah it 's great but thank you very much for your submission thank you and could I now invite cat sport Canterbury Linda Cox that doesn 't look _"

    "text": "right so next we have come money and the Community Connection now nauru trust where I know very well from a previous life and can I first of all say thank you very much for you know agreeing to the s 'more you know sort of focused way of presenting a submission rather than giving you know whole lot of people present for five minutes each but basically repeating the same thing but to have a full presentation and then inviting any others who who want to contribute to the to the to the to the Copa of your submission if they 're great so thank you very much for doing that that 's why we actually appreciate it too so thank you very much for doing it for us so it 's not especially good morning worship counselors staff and community today we we will be presenting to you a pilot project proposed and leave by Community Connection nunnery trust I 'd like to introduce our team here today I have Medicaid our Katawa trustee or Gary Tia director of 0 self consultants New Zealand limited a consulting engineering engineering including shoreline erosion the effects of engineering modifications to coastal and ocean processes and involvement and the design and construction of civil engineering projects and marine environments but like Gary here and myself hasbrouck through assisting us in a PowerPoint but again thank you merely in for this time today we really do appreciate the special circumstances imagine this but first a little history Community Connection narmada trust was formed in 2001 the name simply tells you what we like to do connect the community and the narrowing the waves reflects our lifestyle and for short our first project together with the community was the refurbishment and earthquake strengthening of the North New Brighton War Memorial and community center on the foreshore at North Beach it took us four years of community consultation and engagement local and study white networking lobbying community groups counselors and your plans submissions deputations working with council staff surveys etc etc the trust had the privilege of being involved in the design process here on your left you will see the before picture and on your right how it looks now this project was much if we haven 't had that partnership the building probably wouldn 't be there today we head in a historical corner cares about on your left and the ozone on your right I 'm going to press the road as the memorial hall it 's gone this is our corner now has fire and the ozone were demolished after the earthquakes Vicki wants you to go back 10 she can take a picture come isn 't it gorgeous I love that cares bar you 'll find our community needed a boost so our promenade proposal began to complement and link our stunning coastline to our city and its recreational assets I grew up in some right opposite k-rock so I know the first hand I know firsthand how a community loves a promenade the big picture the ultimate vision this picture here shows our extensive coastline between Spencer park and south shore 19 kilometers of San dreams big picture a promenade that extends and connects all these areas Spencer park and related facilities bottle lake forest and tricks North Shore subdivision thompson park and rafa deep domain the new Travis wetlands field hospital you 're right and CBD hot salt water pools legacy project even River cycleways crushed it Christchurch coastal pathway and the list goes on big picture projects usually have to start small therefore we are proposing a pilot project this map shows the area we are proposing 900 meters between y mari and North Beach surf clubs before I talk in more detail the reason for this trip is that it has an obvious beginning and an end and before I talk about the proposal in more detail here is the list of our consultation process to date and I won 't read this out the consultation also included door knocking the houses opposite the proposed promenade site as you can see we had overwhelming support eighty-four percent two percent undecided and seventeen percent unable to be contacted but we did leave information in their litter boxes with a contact detail that 's the background this picture shows the track on top of the dunes at prison and one of the difficult access points of an urn for anyone other than an able-bodied person so this a concept drawing by graphic designer Paul kinks and smooth chocolate creative shows how the promenade could possibly look a creative recreational promenade that brings life in it to n activity approximately seven to nine metres wide that compliments at surroundings and entices the locals and the rest of the city interests to engage with the coastline to enjoy not only the beach front but the spectacular views from the promenade the promenade has to have a surface that must be absolutely usable by the elderly wheelchairs and pram pushers because the existing tracks and beach are not we have a special section of the coast as it is an accreting beach not an arousing eroding beach there are a few challenges that would need to be positively work through therefore we have met with Environment Canterbury civil defense and coast here to discuss a proposal and perceive hazards the placement of the promenade will need to be set back enough to satisfy storm take but so close enough for beach experience the height of the promenade will be determined by the appropriate authorities however if there is a possibility the maintenance and management this proposal needs to aim towards reducing the maintenance and management costs of the proposed area it is important to us that protection is maintained and strengthened where necessary and that the environment is considered and enhanced we have been networking and consulting with various people in organizations to seek advice on certain aspects including how this proposal may be achieved while taking into consideration the perceived hazards and coastal environment but this probe proposal to advance these issues must be an essential part of the overall plan costings and funding as my father-in-law used to say quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten having said that we do have the preliminary cost estimate prepared by Elliot Duke director Davis v chartered professional engineer preliminary cost estimate for a nine metre wide promenade between y mari in North Beach surf club is 2.4 million we mentioned 9 meters wide and our submission because we need and we needed to indicate to the community that we were not talking about a small path it has to comfortably accommodate walkers cyclists runners etc to build the of the 2.4 is for landscaping and creative features and also includes in these figures of sixty thousand dollar fitness station given the transformational impact at have as a small community organization that is difficult to access resources for projects of this nature our trust work on the premise that money follows the vision plus a lot of hard work network support first money sort later through our consultation process suggestions have been made for possible sources of funding and creative ways to reduce costs for example community context collaborations and possibly earthquake recycled materials so far we have achieved our goals by working and partnership with other community spirited people the unkind work that our consultants trustees and helpers have invested to date would equate to a very significant figure so with regards to the estimated 2.4 million when you are discussing money we ask you to think transformational which leads me to award-winning New Plymouth common art this picture doesn 't really do it any justice medical occur and I went for a visit last week we meet new plymouth district let 's go project manager car little marble landscape architect and we had a little check to the Emir now that 's a well project 14 2 kilometers they keep extending it urban New Plymouth population as 45,000 promenade visitors per month 30,000 their dynamics are different from ours but the principles of how a promenade can impact an area in city are undeniable the New Plymouth District Council and the people of New Plymouth are enjoying accolades Awards health benefits as more and more people become active and enjoy their coastline there is a real positive vibe and the city at the promenade brought as we carried out a community consultation and mentioned the word promenade we were amazed at how many people referred to New Plymouth final page the Christchurch City Council already endorsed coastal pathways and cycleways and have contributed to them this project is also in line with the Berwick Pegasus community boards Christchurch City Council long-term plan 2015 25 submission and I quote the board supports the evaluation of the proposal from the North Shore residents association and Community Connection nunnery trust for a north beach promenade on the foreshore genes noting promenade in an ongoing discussion the concept is similar to the Christchurch coastal pathway the board requests that the plan makes an ongoing line item to enable continuous development of this concept and to maintain existing portions of it a sum of 200,000 per annum over the ten-year plan cycle is suggested end of quote therefore we respectfully request that the following be included and the Christchurch City Council long-term plan 2015 2025 a feasibility study be undertaken and completed in the 2015-16 financial year in close collaboration partnership between Christchurch City Council Community Connection na na do trust and our existing project team I 've found favorable then funding be made available for the pilot project and construction to begin with in the same financial year finally we believe this pilot promenade proposal is a key to showcasing the rest of our cities other beautiful assets this is a project that could start and be completed in one financial year it would generate hope and be a creative exciting project for the whole city our trust has worked with you before and we would like the opportunity to do 's obviously going to be lots of questions but I want to save one for me so Phil David been palling if your discussions of Environment Canterbury miss learning have you done it was even done any sort of or seen the preliminary studies around sort of for example protection of the dunes is that being done yet all that be part of the feasibility study that would be that would be absolutely part of the feasibility study it has to incorporate the environment and how it impacts the environment or enhances the environment this we think the case will be we do have Garrity would you like to eat anything today yeah there 's been two guiding principles in the design of this that we keep the pathway far enough back from the front of the djinns so that we don 't impact on the area that provides erosion demand you see the front of those tunes fluctuate backwards and forwards depending on the NS taunts the sea State Sanders pulled out to create bars when it gets better it gets pushed back on so there is a natural thing as the actual height of the Jun 's he can set it at six meters now that was for possible tsunami and for one that I had great disagreement with 14 waverunner but six meters it is for what wave ran wave run up run up yes but six meters it is and we have a leader from the council data there 's a very good contour plot of all this we 're able to run that pathway at the six meter plot and higher for the whole length of the the distance so we don 't compromise any of the coastal protection function or the storm demand now the one thing when we met he can they were really positive with it in my earlier experiences with he can in the 1990s they were dead set against touching anything you couldn 't vary the height of the June and that 's what is a less expensive well as a screw associate six meters though they 're over there about eight meters now are they some of them are so when I first got involved with this might even know the resource consent is about my mate I mean high water Springs but there is a general consensus amongst he can and others that six meters is adequate right yeah sorry I didn 't mean to interrupt i was actually I thought trying to be helpful that they 're dead because when you look at this it doesn 't look like the June system that we 've got now and that 's because that does require to lower to the six meters but I was going to ask you what it to what point but you 're saying the agreed level what they can exploit six meters yeah great but previously even if you had the six meter you couldn 't touch and eight me to hide you I know you weren 't allowed to shall I bring anything and there has been a complete change in the attitude that he came from their coastal scientist let me discuss that it was really encouraging yeah time out timings everything I mean the the natural hazard strategy is about to be launched by way of you know discussion so it coastal erosion and various other bits and pieces and I do know this is accreting part of our coastline but as you say you 've got to give it up on a storm event and it can come backwards and and forward so but I mean I 'm hearing extremely positive message from you that discussions worth Akina are supportive because I was going to say if we were going to support the feasibility study we would have to include EK and and that mix of collaborationist says that we 're on the all cooperating parties yeah so that sorry Phil you 've at your work till the feasibility study is would be important to you too but it would be cool critical to heavy can at the table oh yeah absolutely and night oh yeah our David thank you viciously I just want to congratulate the team for a great presentation and acknowledge the the work that the trust has done in the North Beach area over a number of years the transformation of the hall at North Beach has in no small measure due to the efforts of particularly gratified for the work they 've done and particularly the visit to mount to a new plymouth last week and I wonder edomite had personal expense I wonder if the team could elaborate on any social and economic benefit that the new plymouth council has derived from the the coastal path way there we did ask them that question and that present Cal said that they 're getting that documentation done at the moment and I think they 're using a consultation company down here in Christchurch so when we were there that information wasn 't available but but the statistics are they do have one of those little Skinner 's on the portal which counts the people that go on up and so that 's why they knew there was 30,000 there but we just walk the township that day and as we talked to shopkeepers than that babe they all talked about it and the one thing that they did to happen to say that came through we did actually ask that the designer and cow in hindsight when you look back about your promenade what would see it in some areas because there 's a seven metres wide they see in some areas as 2.5 minutes too narrow did that make it wider 47 was definitely like the minimal work and the people on the street confirm the same thing thank you yep um clean take you chemin team inspiring stuff and you 've got a good prep record their partnership with counsel on actual delivery of a project to my questions around a wider strategy because it strikes me that we 've got some really good initiatives coming up from the east with the legacy project as well and hopefully we 'll get to the point of a feasibility study dare to do you see this is as part of a wider strategy so it 's not just a you know one project absolutely you do we absolutely see that time at compliments as a wise woman once said to me it 's not instead of its as well as so you know like a mother trying to pick between two children you know you just can 't_''_1292.419 you just want them both Sophie 's 've crossed you out because though you were next and AH poorly okay um well actually I was going to ask the similar question to feel about the dunes and the height so you 've answered that but the feasibility study do you have any idea of the cost of that might be no I don 't really but we did very quickly just sort of talk to Cal and a very casual conversation and you know it was around the forty thousand dollar mark but I mean that 's that was just a very casual conversation and of course until you know the content of what your feasibility studies going to be I 'm gonna figure on that there 's a little bit difficult to sort of and did I hear that you 're requesting that the council fund set in the first instance right that would be the fifteen sixteen year listing in thinking I 'd like to congratulate you from the work you 're doing as well Vicki I just want to say thank you for such an amazing amount of work and for what you are the community so well presented it 's stunning and I just want to know if you are aware of conservation volunteers who actually want to locate the international headquarters possibly in Brighton and whether you 're aware of their work and would you like an introduction to them certainly what they call be just leave us your email and I 'll do that yep I 'm a breath and then Paul yeah hi just a quick bond so just how long is the promenade again the pilot 900 meters those two strip that we 're talking about as between the y mauricio club and the north beach surf club or the beach cafe if you happen to know that on Beach Road and the War Memorial Hall it 's 900 meters could you extend this all the way along yeah so good go back to your previous slide to show that ultimate yeah it could Domino either way and it could actually take on various forms i mean of self brighton or areas down they wanted a Crepsley slightly different look well I mean this is all just conceptual but brighton is that they 're very keen to see this continuing am i dealing what 's the distance to Spencer part to south shore well there 's 19 kilometers have seemed in no change that word right ok so from where you 're proposing how far is it down to the pier are better kilometer another kilometer from the end of and would you say it 's roughly 2 million dollars a kilometer or is that a about 2.4 dependent including the landscaping and all the lovely features and verse 8 years 2.4 that 's the preliminary so four and a half five four two case thank you Paul thank you very much there 's a a great presentation the my view the the crisis is forgotten that it 's actually a beachside city and my question would be do you think that this promenade would encourage the wider crisis 2xe visit the ax beach that they had right on their doorstep well I think from the figures from New Plymouth only being an urban study port area of 45,000 yet they have 30,000 visitors on sees a lot I that promenade is all around the wielder they just everybody loves them so I really do think that this author that just enhances it and connects and networks with all those that better be like I 'm just going to come to ours and look as though logs I want to lick with the summer those other walks of them so essentially this is a metropolitan to sort of these ads for absolute the beach is a metropolitan beachside so would be the promenade thank you Yannick if you went to that was quite quickly but have you talked to Deirdre heart from the University around the tsunami risk because I know that there 's been a lot of concern I still vividly remember the boxing day tsunami you know there was a move before that don 't get rid of the sand dunes and then basically it saw what happened overseas and probably retreated from that but just I know that we 've had some new tsunami risk modeling done and I just wondered whether this being taken into account with your proposal address your question I we haven and we also have had a talk with just some coke and Environment Canterbury so they have given us and data to Gary um civil defense recalls of the year to be seen but it was also part of the process we haven 't have a full process for a small community group organization so we you know we 've done as much as we can to this point I mean I just you know applaud the work you 've done previously and that community center is a really really fantastic example what you suggest is certainly always part of the continent would have to be addressed owner and a feasibility study yeah no just six meters is the level at the moment and I think before we worry about adjusting that we have to fix the holes on the system at north beach in New Brighton I find the whole thing ridiculous when we talk about it that if we really have a tsunami it just pours straight through the gaps yeah and that 's what I was really interested in because I think I know we haven 't thoughts and long source but I think it is important to keep that in the context of what what you 're proposing so that we just make sure that the public don 't get alarmed unnecessarily the information that we 've had to date simply just put as that first tsunami would be you 've got approximately 12 to 14 hours to prepare the community for evacuation the issue is the evacuation and then a near tsunami apparently the percentage is virtually a 0% that we would give a near tsunami but having said that you know that was fairly low-key I 'm theater an army that the height the height would not be as high I mean we 're talking a meter of babes potentially Tim this is a bit closer to home at Caroline Bay the promenade really lovely and that 's got full access for disabled elderly the whole whole lot which is wonderful I 'm just saying probably along the lines of mobile reference that this is the brain taking over the distance between the pier and north beach would be a belief in taste it got visitors going dear and to spread that along the MU the wonderful it have you guys thought of that as well because I mean we live with tsunami you live with earthquake risks and we 've just got to make the most of the ACS we got and 2 requires tomorrow don 't you although yeah yeah that that building and doing it they do they 're living with what they 've got and I make Caroline both fantastic place to be and yet we sit tend to forget our Beach exactly right now you have to write I mean as I started off you know this is about a big picture this is actually our city so anything that happens on some anything that happens in Brighton it 's a one for all of us from so that 's how we see it definitely you 've captured it and also when it came to New Plymouth we did talk about the level of risk and how they approach that and they see that the engineers involved set certain levels for certain and in the council chose one of all on the rate they have one section of jayden system that they did have to go through yeah we actually cycle that I 'm 14.2 h and back mobilize what about for electric okay there 's a nice little business to you can you go back to the picture because that the question I want to ask as it is what is it made of so you know is that is that are they as it would all the way through no it 's not what all the way through the week we 're just really wanting to emphasize the fact for the wheelchairs and the prams and the elderly anything and even as is just not doable for them so we 've had sections of things to make it because we have see creative so there 's a license beer and this is just conceptual so a lot of things in here but it does have to be a surface I mean people that construct it there 's lots of variants that could be concrete it could be ash felt it could be exposed aggregate lots of ways that the previous submission talked about the concrete all through the river and town and putting concrete throughout june system probably wouldn 't wouldn 't wouldn 't necessarily be what people would expect i think people are expecting a wooden promenade i think well it 's not what we 've had that 's not what we 've been a huge area submissions for the 682 people that did submit to this having see that whatever the surface is needs to blend in so that is just not noticeable it 's just really enhances and feels like it as part of the environment mmm that 's really important to us so to answer that question it 's really about need to get those people that know how to construct something like that together and work but you wouldn 't rule that out because i mean one of the submissions that we did get was actually specifically about a wooden promenade so and it was an associated with this one obviously but there were also others that that did refer back to your submission that they 're assumed it was water so could open up to that possibility as well all right let 's it 's good well it 's it 's probably given us enough to be getting on with and I think with that feedback wanting he can and I Tahoe at the table that would be certainly my my view about we would have to go with us I don 't know whether we would be in a position to put something on budget before doing a feasibility study but if we were to put the feasibility study on budget then we would be able to look at the that the next step and the provider that the feasibility study you know produce the right result we would be able to look at it in our annual planning processes we 've been making it clear to people who 've come through that this is going to be an iterative process we 've got a base case for our long-term plan and there 's still a long way for us to go in terms of getting the numbers right Thank You inspector okay can I just say one thing yes my toe 2013 we saw Bucky here toe and of course he 's not with us anymore so we 've continued the process and we 're in the process of having a meeting with to do not walk to our to be great we have started that process brilliant that 's perfect thank you kids we do have bucked up here for you all I feel great yes please some some somebody will come and click those off you on end to pass them around I don 't know what was it there 's nobody else from your group that wanted to to speak on us up to you people here that was that okay do you know know they can come to the table yep if they could all come up together that would be great yeah that 's a typo hell yeah thank you for hearing the submission um just personally I grew up in Nelson so it 's a real beach town and I 'm accident when I was 19 and kind of cut that off and I 'll see if you 're going to wheel along can see this has been a great asset College the city for myself I 'd use it I 've got recently married with three stepkids Oh be great to go to take them to the beach and we allow and be involved at the moment the beach is inaccessible as a little walkway on to the beach at some there and there 's a promenade and Scarborough which is great we had like white a few times and I Christchurch 's the council 's committed to making the city accessible and oh the lake Graham common here 's a real and Oh advocate and I 'm sure he would love love this this concept so full support of it thank you thank you hello is you know I 'm Brooke so I 'm in full support of this promenade and I 'm also a lifetime resident of North fate and I 'm also a king sooper my husband and I and so just over the years that I 've been I 've been able to observe how often the beaches use especially in the winter months so just I think that and it 's not it wouldn 't just be a summer youth thing often there 's lovely days in the morning all day infecting and winter and where people can use us and so I think would be a great answer all year round and also at different times of the day so sometimes the beaches and always it 's safe to access is in the evening and the people lurking around and the different area since I just like it would be a much more open and safer place to use also a safe at exes ways just like Steve 's talked about here and because the wrong said apparently there are quite dangerous and you have to work very carefully some knockdown them so yes we and full support we think it would be really a life-giving project to our area and also to the city and we do fully support for lowering of the germs thank you hi I 'm Brad Thompson and I 'm a mum of resident I 'm a resident and North Beach and also a mum and as you can see we the point was it it 's quite hard looking along the current sand dunes employment like it 's really narrow and we can 't walk along it 's not like Brooksie that 's not always easy to get down the current stick things and so yeah we really support the white had service surface so we can yeah push our friends and we go you know they grow up get our kids to learn it get it on there try and yeah so we 're really supportive of it and also a line in the sand rings we would be king for that too because then we can see the ocean that 's great thank you my name 's Amy redpath I 'm also frightened resident and grow up and brighten and that 's why basically we want it lowered and we want to be able to see our boys so they don 't get up to mischief round the corner I 'm just kidding but it wouldn 't be helpful you know I just think this is such a wonderful opportunity to do something positive for a relatively low visit as well with the premise they don 't often know the tides and it affects I 've been out so I 'm not sure if that 's been talked about but people turn up and at the moment you know during the winter as well though the tides come right up to the gin so you actually can 't north along at all with the pram said this this provides an opportunity group to come and enjoy the O 's in walking along there any time today and we 're just we 're just so excited about about the prospect of this happening in the future that it would positively that it would create for something in our area so that people can enjoy it thanks for hearing hearing from us today right thank thank you very much what it 's going to thank you for coming in I really appreciate that you 've got this big proposal and that will take some time although it sounds over great sooner rather than later but I just wondered because you 've talked about the axis issues is there anything in excess excess for frames or young families brighton surf pep so i can get from the concrete but there 's often so much debris to get through and then to get down has to be a low tide to be able to walk along in push the pram along the beach as well i just can 't do it on the top and we 've got a state-of-the-art mountain buggy and you know just you know it just can 't_''_2305.05 can 't_''_2305.47 handle going along with jeans these I don 't ask you seen but these are what it 's like at the moment so got lots of gaps and as you can see we 're carrying a mountain by you down something yeah and you just work at young in Colombo I think that some of those ones are being quite polite there are some along the coastline you almost need to be a mountain go to climb up yeah so short Tim and to answer the question yeah something I 'm not sure yeah yep thank the hell the piers great I got the kids would push up beach it 's great you know in a sunny day when it 's a bit rough when you feel the salt in your face now it 's fair to walk along just be amazing to wheel lock me in the short term not really as far as a wheelchair goes yeah so it 's a great prospect Phil had a question as well can I just ask you but you can be referred to lowering of the dunes sister to achieve the pathway and I 'm just planning in terms of sort of like when we look at the pre-feasibility study of course we 'll have to be across the science to we 're getting information about that as a mirror indicated but I 'm just and what one of those people is due to have University I think nany referred to but I 'm just learning if any of you might know any young geography students or engineering students who might be studying say coastal science or if there might be people in your wider community who might be doing that and so that in fact they can be we get the F possible I think that differently we 've Garrett here comes and coastal engineer it 's become we rely on it a lot so in addition to their expert advice the stupid the lot of students will be looking at this issue really had and I 'm just wondering if there might be some other again so we so we have the different studies that feel like joined up for us at some stage it was just whether in fact might be some young students and look and the wider brightly we can look into it I don 't know personally any at the moment um yeah I think I think the point that fills making come cut that come to that yeah I think the point that fills making us that I mean when when this was first raised you know when I was the MP for the area I knew nothing about what sand dunes did so I didn 't know anything about June system so I went out to the University and and and geography 101 on jun systems you know just just a a chat to a professor on there and and and that 's when I learned to understand that it 's there it 's the volume of sand that 's available to be given up in the storm event that as as an issue and there we were talking about height and I was going eh well that 's great because that means that the volume of sin you just make them flatter and wider but the trouble was marine pray marine parade sort of kind of as a hard edge to where you can move June 's back to and it 's that the image that you had on their looks so wide but I mean I 'm in favor of a feasibility study but you know just I hope that that what is really what we 're talking about without encroaching on the road and I don 't know how we had in the road or do we yeah and yeah and co secure one of the plans 20 years ago as documented in there that the scene during what an hour section as was 15 meters wide we told us that the sand dunes in that section and our 80 approximately 80 meters wide they are advancing that growing growing towards the sea and that 's why we don 't have a beach at high tide to walk on our private have grown forward 30 meters they used to be in line with the little rock wall at the North Beach surf club but now it 's there about 25 meters forward of that so and also on the other side on the road side because over the years as it 's been allowed to sort of fall down the sand and why they 've been tying it down we 've got set on bus stops under those sand dunes and at one point the road the white line and the road was moved towards the houses just to accommodate it and then they were bollards put them so now when you 're driving down Marine Parade and you want to turn into your house opposite of bollard everything behind eubanks up so but what works very well as when the Effingham Street cut was done and about they put on a retaining wall that 's where the car parks are and that just works really really well or is the other areas and you know create the home eight that you wouldn 't want a retaining wall all along that marine parade the emphasis is creative so you know when you win the design or look of the is done then I 'm sure there 's ways around these days of making whatever is necessary looking really good yeah yeah all right so um all right well we know what we are going to be considering so thank you very much and think the community to for so much support to the people that have come and fronted up then so do pass that be you 've got a large number of people obviously supporting this and much appreciated thank you very much thank you right _"

    "text": "next item as the new economics party Rick 's purity in a tato cutter thank you for the opportunity to speak with you first of all party is that appendage is a misnomer it 's not a registered party it 's possible that in the future it would contest elections if no parliamentary party adopts the new economics movements proposals but for the time being it 's purely a think tank and a growing movement dedicated to developing economic policies and tools to enable in support and environmentally sustainable in socially just society we are a group of people who believe in the public creation of money without interest and in the principle of sharing the values of the Commons instead of texting labor enterprise and entrepreneurship we advocate charging a rent for the exclusive use of any part of the Commons including land we want an economy that has organized the way nature organizers decisions made throughout the whole no waste use of local resources complexity feedback mechanisms where there is some competition but much more collaboration and the result we believe would be a vibrant robust and resilient local authorities our submission has a number of topics we propose and I realized that situation city councillors em with immediate huge problems and what we are suggesting are measures that would take a little time to implement so they 're not going to solve your problems this year but we hope they be given serious consideration yeah and indecision today was just a few minutes for things that are a relatively radically different not just mere tweaking the interchange we have here is certainly not enough to adequately deal with the issues but introducing them or reminding you of what 's in the submission we propose a method of land value capture to the fund infrastructure we propose also that the rating system should be on land not on capital value that Christchurch have a council or community owned bank and that Christchurch establish a second currency a local currency all as measures of providing for resilience and an assisting meeting some of the shortfall that given your budget over this long term briefly land value capture it 's it 's a means of the community the public at to properties as a result of public spending in community spending when land goes when properties go up in price it 's in an area it 's largely because of the services provided by the community at large and it seems only fair and right that the people who own those properties don 't keep all of that wonderful gain but are levied and that that that supports the right take for the city other people will have submitted I 'm presuming on a Christchurch currency but I 'm happy to answer questions about that as well and about blend radio capture and why we should rate land and not capital value I 'm open to questions Riggs I 'm gonna well only revco fees but bat but I just want to say that I really enjoyed reading your submission and it was just so neat to to to think about what we do is a is business as usual in an entirely different way but starting from the the measure of the commons in the public good you know so I just I thought it was really good I this plane but I would really love to have some public engagement around some of these big ideas you know for the future sorry Rev Thank You Rex for that now in terms of the way we apply rates at the moment we do apply some of it on lands and some of it on the capital value so in a way that system is already there so would it be that difficult to switch just to land value improvement the resistance would come from vested interests who have invaluable land worth not well developed so more likely to be people who are land banking speculators holding land and looking for the capital gain everybody else would be advantaged by the change because its rating the land value not the capital improvements in that sense it 's fair across the board for me more people it would also have the effect of not penalizing or discovery capital development of valuable sites in the city sights and unversity would have a slight discouraging effect on the development of land on the periphery and so would come it would encourage more concentrated council and providing infrastructure but also more efficient use of land and in terms so that seems pretty straightforward to implement in terms of I guess the difference between using land value capture as opposed to development contributions for the financing of infrastructure have you given any thought to how that well worse out and development contributions that provides a one-off first year only type of input to council whereas land value capture is ongoing it 's also seemed to be politically acceptable to a lot of people they see that it makes sense that if land values increase because of what the community is providing there it 's only fear that a lot of that value is returned to the community yeah cool okay good exam thank you very much so I think you 've given us some some food for thought I look forward to the edges being considered and if not being able to be incorporated into this long-term plan which would be unfortunately nothing appears there at least some on guy board for that are you going discussion yeah great thank you _"

    "text": "is some only one missing so it 's not a bad loss rate use a nice age from the green party till now Kodaka tall good morning councillors very pleased to be here and thank you for the opportunity and the major concern and my submission on behalf of the Green Party is that of asset sales because we don 't believe that that 's only long-term interests of the city and residents and so I just like to make a few preliminary comments and then open it up to questions and we think the council is being quite hasty and proposing to sell 750 million of its assets in year one of the plan given the considerable uncertainty about the council 's financial position and the fact that you don 't know all of the information and as you 've said memere it is an iterative process one of the major reasons of course for the shortfall is the anchor projects in the seven hundred and ninety-three million that is the council 's contribution to funding those anchor projects the city is being lumbered with some of those projects surprised that there 's been no formal request by the council to renegotiate the cost sharing agreement and look at what the anchor projects are doing in terms of the council 's budget you mean a public request yes well because we 're queer side breath of course we 're British that one of anyway consultation meetings it will see that there 'd be no formal request from the council to central I have written to central government about not only the cost sharing agreement but about the number of different issues that we need to resolve with central government of course I 've done that okay well um in terms of but I just don 't put it on the front page of the newspaper there is a petition and that was collected and very a very short timeframe there are four hundred and eighty three signatures on that petition which endorse that call for projects like the stadium to actually come out of the cost sharing agreement so we believe that the renegotiation of the agreement is absolutely critical to helping reduce that funding shortfall and the stadium spending 253 million on that and years eight nine and ten of the long-term plan is of course are contributing to the shortfall so if the cost sharing agreement is renegotiated that could come out be put beyond the life of the plan and that would also free up the government 's contribution to be spent on the must-haves like the repair of the horizontal infrastructure rather than the nice to haves like the stadium and the convention center which is escalating and cost so there has been I think coming to the media by the CEO of Sarah recently about the delays there there has not been a full business case which has been made public I don 't think it is are responsible for the council to be committing public money to projects and like the stadium or government money to things like the convention center where there is no business case which looks at its usage and that provides an assurance that the project actually stacks up financially mr. amla has said that there is who the work being done on those business cases but Sierra has committee of making those business cases public yet it is public money that has been directed towards these major projects one of the other reasons for opposing asset sales is that the capital spending program I don 't think is realistic and the Auditor General and its recent review of the 2013-14 annual reports by council noted that across local authorities there 's generally a trend of doing substantially less capital work then council 's budget for particularly where it relates to replacement and renewal expenditure-only doing about three-quarters of what 's budgeted for replacement and in the documents that go with this long plan the council itself admits that it doesn 't know whether it 's got the capacity to deliver on the capital program and nor whether the construction industry has their capacity and so it seems premature Lynn to be selling assets to fund an ambitious capital spending program which the council itself admits that it doesn 't know whether it can deliver on I think too that the council can be much more rigorous and its budgeting and the proposal to generate on at least 150 degree of flexibility for unforeseen circumstances is providing quite a measure of padding and cushioning in the budget and that if you 're doing things like selling assets which generate revenue for the city you need to be much more rigorous in the budget and in the submission also outlined concerns about the the lack of clear criteria around whose strategic partners would be the fact that the removal of all of the assets from the list of strategic assets including red bus and eco central will mean that the council could then sell those without any further public consultation and I think the consultation documents are slightly unclear because there 's been some discussion about Orion the airport company in the poor company but red bus and eco central and horncastle arena in the parking buildings that 's less clear in the major consultation document they 're being proposed for sale as well and really disappointed too that it 's been the media that have highlighted that the council 's proposing to do a fast-track process for land sales without community board and public consultation on that and that 't think that the council is always in the best position to know the value of those land holdings of the community unless it does community consultation but now stop and happy to answer any questions thank you well maybe if I start with one question and perhaps you could provide us with an explanation of what you understand to the audit requirements for the long-term plan process in terms of the the council 's obligations well I understand that you cannot put insurance three payments in there because of the uncertainty around those no that 's not correct so but I really meant about assumption so leaving aside insurance could we put on your suggestion that put into our budget at your suggestion that the government 's reader visits contribution to the to be no that couldn 't be in your budget and that is why the renegotiation of the cost sharing agreement which I think there 's quite substantial public support for is quite critical but the outcome of that renegotiation would have to be one thing so in order to achieve that we 'd has to say i mean the shortfalls 1.2 billion so you 're suggesting that none of the contributions to any of the anchor projects proceed library the tower no no if you read the submission it 's quite clear around the stadium and the convention center and I think this increasing comment about the dead zone that the convention center will create the escalating costs are the council has importantly money arts but far conviction that government is funding the convention center if the cost sharing agreement was renegotiated the 400 million dollar shortfall and the horizontal infrastructure could be funded and part from the government redirecting scam we spotted this assumed 400 and 400 million dollar shortfall are we allowed to put that on our budget under the terms of the audit audit offices requirements I think that would have to be part of that iterative process well we can 't amend point that I 'm making is is there and I think you 're accepting we can 't_''_500.529 put any of these items up on the budget and we are required to balance the budget for every year for the next that the cost sharing agreement has to be renegotiated because your budget at the moment has provision for the stadium in years eight nine and if we took the stadium outer would make no difference to the to the shortfall that we face in the first five years we 've already pushed it out we can push it out beyond the ten years and and and essentially we will you know I mean there is obviously going to be an additive process with central government over a number of these issues but even if you took that amount of our budget because of where it sits in our budget it doesn 't make any difference to the shortfall that we have and the immediate sense well it might yep just to clarify that I think this is an important point around the stadium it 's not actually 253 million it 's 110 million 143 million is the insurance out that has to go towards the stadium regardless so the only the extra bit of money we 're talking about is 110 million sonus I think people need to get the mentioned something about the Headroom the Headroom isn 't something new the Headroom is a question of whether we keep some debt facility as opposed to using our equity so we could borrow more and go to the the limit of the two hundred fifty percent of net debt to revenue we 're choosing not to go to that limit in case we incur understand you didn 't explain it lighter you suggested it was a different thing altogether but it 's actually rather than going to our limit now we 're saying actually we 're going to leave ourselves some Headroom in case there are further costs coming in the future is not a budget issue it 's a funding issue we 're just going back to the stadium there is still a hundred and ten million of expenditure that is in the budget and that 110 million as a significant figures oh absolutely yeah but let 's be clear about what the number is it 's not 253 it 's 110 but I think there are some other there 's a number of misconceptions around a number of other questions Yanni did you want I keep hearing reference to the phrase we need to renegotiate with government the cost year I guess I 'm just trying to understand whether that 's really what you 're asking for at the time that the blueprint other council that its own share an idea plane the minister earthquake recovery said it 's a pretty big wish list it 's now up to the people of Christchurch to debate the plan prioritize its projects and decide how much they are prepared to fund it but of course what we know is the government then went on to its own blueprint which raised the central city anchor projects from 800 million to 2 billion without any public consultation so d are you really asking us to talk to our community about the central city spending particularly the two billion around what the priorities are rather than renegotiate with God my understanding is that the council 's contribution is fixed in that cost sharing agreement that is a it 's a strong agreement and therefore for any changes there has to be a renegotiation are misconceptions there is a huge amount of public money being spent on these projects and when there is strong public opposition to the stadium in terms of the discussions I 've had with people when signing petition and outside bed and also for the convention center and the government is spending all of that money on the convention center and a public-private partnership that we still don 't know the nature we don 't know who 's going to own it we don 't know what the operating costs are going to be and so that is all contributing to we 're money gets spent on big projects and not being spent on the horizontal infrastructure trying to ask is we this is the third annual plan process I 've been through where the public have come and said to us we don 't agree with the stadium we don 't agree with the convincing that we don 't agree with how much you 're spending on the metro sports and the response has been you can 't move amendments to our budget because it 's out of order cost year was done in secret so in my view I 'm trying to understand as do you think the public should have a right to be able to make some meaningful submissions to the prioritization of that big wish list at the minister all dirt around what the funding priority should be across that that cost do you think that is why I 've made the submission because I thought that this process is the only one we 've been able to actually comment on the anchor projects because we haven 't been provided that opportunity end by SIA and so secretly renegotiating with government cost-share doesn 't seem to wouldn 't seem to me to deal with the issues you 're raising in your self it wouldn 't be a secret renegotiation it 's just that that at the moment is what they is how the blueprint is going to be delivered but there hasn 't been the opportunity for public input into that except through processes like this one which is an indirect way yes I agree with you but it 's the only option we being submissions it 's very helpful and just in terms of the not selling assets when we 've prepared for the budget I 've gone through I think about seven different scenarios that I 've had deloitte 's run where the debt actually goes into the companies rather than we have need to sell companies it I can 't get it to work because the debt level goes too high if you had to sell any asset including the ones that are not listed like enable what what are the ones that you would be prepared if you had to say I appreciate that go under but if you had to which would be the one that you would actually look at first well it wouldn 't be Iran because there 's a major source of revenue for the council I think it 's a natural monopoly and because investment decisions on in terms of its is quite strengthening have paid off in terms of recovery after the quake I find it really hard to answer actually yeah we do too yeah so next Eugenie I 'm just wanna ask you now and we refer to the concrete instead of the grassy River beings I 'm just wondering do you and like as your week as you indicate that sassy relief project so we don 't have much saying if unique but we putting in a contribution so do you have some considered environments environmentally around the change from grass to concrete yes and again that is 98 million dollars of public money that 's being spent on 2.8 kilometers of the central city and there 's been no public engagement with whether we actually want all of the river bank opposite ops of terrace to be tuned into sort of a series of concrete terraces so the government itself i think in one paper is suggesting pulling back about 20 million of the expenditure on the the park but again to me that is a nice to have some of that park in the central city not a need to have and the needs to have other appear of the horizontal infrastructure and they should be the priorities for the spender thank you you know what should someone ask you it 's a pre-feasibility study and we haven 't actually seen the study here but interview and like clearly you 're opposed to that part but i just wonder about the concept of the title barrier from your experience in science how you might see that in the future i 'm not a scientist but one of the first projects either when i came to christ church was on the title bear coming on the Walston cut in the Barrett and how the engineers had not looked at the salon which going further upstream I think engineering solutions like a total barrage doing major changes the way the estuary functions it 's a really important area for birds and we 're better to do soft solutions like providing a much bigger buffer area around the margins and then so the pre-feasibility study not much problem with that but just highlighting that before the council goes and spends a lot of money we need to look at some of the options there in terms of using soft engineering rather than been hard structures hydrogen and don 't congratulate the council for sea level rise again I agree a little in you just mind just back on the balanced budget requirements just looking at the LGA I 'm not sure that it includes capital expenditure but that 'd be your in the budget a balanced budget requirement that for your to petition I think you 'd better get some professional advice on it yeah I think you do too clean yeah I thought we 'd covered that off thank you very much you know Casey and the _"

plan I think I 'm just going to make a few comments and really open up for any questions of clarification around our submission and we 're all available here to answer questions so as has been pointed out this this is a joint submission under the name of Tyrone anger but made on behalf of the Runanga of a whiter hair all of which part of your community of christ church maha nui curto limited and also with representation from mutter potpourri charitable trust now ruining our the sex paper to be who hold manaphy noah within the row he of Christchurch City Council so you know one of their issues that we 've been coming together with us is because we want to develop a relationship with the city council in in recognized that on a by starting you know two worked either in the way we are we will be able to build that relationship truant as statutory recognizes the representative tribal body for no Tahu fernery and that 's established under legislation and it is created to manage the collective interests of the assets of the tribe and in doing so support each of the Runanga and in a way that enables us and allows us to exercise the Roma teratoma and to determine our own destiny so that we can build and sustain our communities as we have done successfully for generations and I think the relationship with the council recognizes the activities of the council and the importance of those in terms of sustaining our communities collectively it is really important that we have a good relationship with your with your counsel and while we each is puppet appear una ahead manaphy Noah over our tokiwa we have come together as cheers to progress issues of mutual interest one of these is as I 've already outlined the development of a strong relationship with the council we value the steps at the as the senior staff to start building an effective relationship with us and we look forward to progressing there over the coming months and you know while they say months you know a relationship as something that develops over years it is hoped that our submission outlines the extent of our interests as monofin were within the city and in the activities that you counsel has responsibility for in addition to the cheers forum there are two tribal entities that are part of our structure that have specific mandates within the city and I thought that I would just sort of talk about these because they 're does tend to be confusion at times so maja noe karate Oh limited in the matter corporate charitable trust and if you turn over your page I 've tried to represent men and a

the City Council your worship that is the end of the formal part of our presentation we are here to answer any questions that your council may have think you and I acknowledge at the beginning that this is the first time and I think this is a huge advance for us and we are honored that you have come and but the first one that I wanted to kind of address as the manor fino acknowledgement and I kind of want to acknowledge that there was a deficiency and the consultation document but I wanted to offer an assurance as it has published so I just wanted to clear that one off the table because it was a genuine oversight on our behalf and we 're really grateful that you 've brought it to our attention this is something that we do need to address in terms of the the description of the the two organizations MKT as we as we know the maha nori kurata or trust and the mutter potpourri charitable trust we don 't have a direct relationship with it 's the relationship with Sarah but I understand that there has been discussion to try and engage in a similar way over our involvement and anchor projects but it does it does highlight the importance of establishing engagement relationships around these different things that are going on in our city at the moment so I really appreciate the fact that you 've done that for us also Andrew and then Yanni thank you thank you very much indeed for your presentation this morning and also for leaving the opportunity to ask questions so that we can better understand the the points that you 've raised in refer to submission point number nine for into the relationship with the little support company and clearly there 's an implication within that paragraph that the current relationship with LPC is a constructive one and I am pleased to see that halfway through that paragraph you say we 're concerned as a significant number of shares could be sold to an individual or entity that does not share a desire to work with ruining over the management of a Corral point and you refer to making a kind and you refer to other detrimental effect what sort of risk are you thinking of all what sort of effects could you see if there were to be a sale of shares or more particularly if there were to be a sale of shares to a partner that didn 't share a desire to work closely with ruining her in the way that the current port company are doing yes so the big the big issue is around my hangar KY and the the puppet up around the harbour have worked hard to build our relationships with LPC and we think that moving forward so for us it 's about ensuring that we do have long-term relationships we recognize that the port company isn 't the only contributor to issues in the harbor but nonetheless they have a very important role to play so I guess we 're just flagging to you an issue that we see is important in terms of the ongoing development of a harbor there is and better health than it currently is so respect for that would be a precondition to the sale of any shares and the poor company yeah Yanni I heard three questions what and thank you very much for your submission it 's great and I think it probably raises the need because there 's a number really important issues to have them much closer ongoing engagement with you on a number of things so in the brief time that we have today I really had three questions one was I hear what you 're saying about recognition of Maori and mana finna work acknowledgement in our urban design and in our central city I just wondered in terms of what we 've 's no recognition of naming of streets with the indigenous culture so I just kind of find it a little bit strange that you 're asking us to to take into account those values but but personally I 'm not sure that they 're happening in your own subdivisions well while I 'm not here today to debate what know who property are doing I don 't think that 's correct but I think in the broader context there is work going on around naming processes and I think it is important for us all to consider how how places are named in and who is involved in that process and I think there is opportunity and that has already been recognized and some work that is being done with multiple Prairie around around naming processes thank you and then just the two other questions were one a release support the concern you 've raised around the storm water overflows and as you 'll be aware our whole budget is about really prioritizing so weaving told that one of the drivers victorious girl was not a who and when you the money not think spent on okay jaani jaani jaani ipad you don 't really want to kind of interrupt the question but can we reframe it well you know excuse me we 've already just had a representation about the raw butter property which represents no to heredity and that 's the driver for the relationship around the anchor projects so and today have been under is it yes but but what you 're doing is you are asking the question and an appropriate way given the nature of the submission that has been made it has to factor into our long-term plan so if you could rephrase it should it is not night our who that is involved in that it is mutter properly which has a relationship an agreement with Sarah in relation to the anchor projects so let me turn rephrase that this is not a submission from Dean I 'm just trying to just try to understand it as a prioritization of our budget which clearly we 've got a huge amount of money 160 million things been on central city transport projects not fixing roads you 're asking for us to have more of a focus on overflows roar storage going into our rivers which you know I think makes a lot of things but you haven 't commented on where if we try to find the money to do that we 're the priority should be at what expense of some of those other projects and I will should try to understand in a general sense if you had a view on the prioritization of some of those big expensive projects happening in the central city vs these projects that you 're saying that should be really important in terms of that is so so I know that the shift is away from the Victoria Square be an hour it 's that your issue is which you know when we 're setting priorities what should we be prioritizing in order to get those clean rivers that we all want to achieve well I recognize that council has many many responsibilities in part of your challenge as counselors to actually weigh all of those up obviously you know we do have priorities around land our relationship and well-being with the land but equally we realized that council has many different pots that it has to allocate funds to and I don 't think today in the short amount of time we 're going to come to those answers but we we 're happy to engage your council on those measures and I 'd like to make that an offer that we have an ongoing engagement around us that isn 't you know because I mean we 've said that this this particular long-term plan although it you know sort of legally has to be signed off by the end of june this year we see it as a base case that 's got to be an iterative process we don 't know all our numbers yet and we 're going to be continuing the process after the first of July on Capitol reprioritization and we would love no tahu to have more of a role in helping us set those priorities are filled thank you I just want to ask you about your submission points about the waste water overflows and the impact on on page 23 how in fact that you would like them to be eliminated those waste water overflows and so were the port of us I think and on page 26 you refer to the harbors and in the case in the case of lyttelton harbour in ikaria harbor my understanding is that and without printing you think my understanding is that council are well aware of the impact of pollution on those on those habits the the one the winery harbor of course as you 're aware has gone out for consultation and so that is part of this process too so hearing what you have to say about that and really matters to us but my Christian tune is is really helped well I asked and we want to for example clean up the waste would fix the wastewater problems so that when stormwater adds to the soap it all adds the sewage that goes out into the sea though and though some heavy rain events how do we balance that though with for example cleaning up particular smaller Harbor like my new e terms of the cost going to sit here and provide you with the answers to some very difficult and texting questions that you 've got but I think overall as you develop your strategies you need to take into account what we consider to be the environmental bottle bottom lines we absolutely recognize that you know it 's taken a long time for these things to happen it 's not going to be fixed overnight but what we 're asking for is a program that has some clear kind of I guess goals in putting some time frames around those you 'll be pleased to know that it 's exactly the position that you can hear as well so I think we 'll be talking with each other quite a lot over the next few years Becky thank you two questions when you refer to the aquifers and I couldn 't agree more with your with your submission and you realize that there he can control the water we would love to get to the situation we 're going into the aquifers is forbidden can I just suggest to you that you make submissions my question is on social housing and asked for strategies and consult and consultation and can you just tell me whoo-wee whoo-wee contact oh no we 're on top of it I do okay out right now so just for the overall social marry again Mary 's glycated details apparently already know we already know turn ok Pauline think he might be nuts Glenn Vicki stole my thunder quite angry with it housing so yes ok yo dawg Jimmy I wasn 't up didn 't think we 'd get to you but floors thank you thank you check one question we got into the item ten summation pointer your particular emphasize would like to seeking involvement with the Council on Maori economic development strategies but a moment a council requests the CDC paintable development corporation who established a church also also popular by rangeela are properly of the Canterbury development strategy etc so you 're the strategy of Mali the economic environment ready you pre for is a part of this kind of culture to ignore the bone strategy or is a savory from these the strategy well I think Development Corporation I think just flagging that Murray economic development is important to us all and it needs to be clearly articulated and plans no different to recognizing us and all the other work that you do and actually that 's a that 's a very powerful note to end on so can I thank you again acknowledge that you know the fact that you read the the consultation document and looked at our long-term plan the fact that you put together such a comprehensive submission and the fact that you came here today I just think it 's a it 's been tremendous and you know it 's not the first part of our engagement and it 's certainly not the last part of our engagement so thank you very very much shut up killing your worship phase of government thank you thank you very much hmm yes we 're we 're now going to break for a cup of tea we 're slightly behind schedule but that 's okay so if we could restart again at eleven-fifteen _"

    "text": "Gretchen the rush the christchurch symphony orchestra it 's probably go brush and probably pronouncing your name incorrectly sorry Gretchen I 'm pronouncing your CNN man correctly no you did right oh okay a good morning well like all of us here the CSO loves the city and we love the people that live here and we love to share our music with our community we realize that music doesn 't repair roads it doesn 't rebuild houses or fix the sewage but music can contribute in a very real and meaningful way to the vibrancy in creativity of the city in which we love it can also provide a moment of escape from things when they get pretty tough and music can bring people together from all walks of life from different parts of our community or with the common purpose of having our spirits lifted the CSO is really proud to be able to play a part in ensuring that Christchurch is a great city in which to live and we do this both on and off the concert platform connecting with 90,000 people each year through our 're excited by the new emerging Christchurch and strive to reflect its increasing diversity and our own activities but so are we actually walking the talk well to answer that I just like to give you a quick snapshot of what the CSO will be getting up to over just the next several weeks we 'll be performing for free concerts for 23 different primary schools from throughout the city the concerts are titled compose yourself and are a fun look at how Sounders made how an orchestra works and gives students an opportunity to take charge in compose an orchestral piece themselves by selecting melodies harmonies and rhythms we 're presenting rock divas featuring two of new zealand 's leading ladies of rock Julia Dean 's and Anika more then we 're back to the air force museum for a concept the a piece for orchestra and live electronics as well as a very special work commissioned by the CSO Fortana portal a traditional Marty instruments and orchestra performed by Ariana Tuco another outstanding new zealand artist also with her roots and Christchurch in this concert will also be made available for free through the center for new zealand music and partnership with New Zealand on air but between all of that we 're squeezing and free public masterclasses by international violinist susie park as well as finishing our current brock festival which is taking place in a city churches currently and i 'm delighted to say we 've sold out every concert in the festival and I 'm particularly grateful that you 've conveniently sheduled our hearings today so I could come and share that news with you but in addition to this type of concept based activity we also present our community engagement program in last year our musicians were involved in over 2,000 hours of community engagement delivering more than 80 individual projects to over 15,000 participants and thanks to generous sponsorship we were able to offer these activities free of charge ensuring the access to music is available for all and in a new initiative this year we 're partnering with the Foundation for the blind and what we hope will be an ongoing relationship and we 're also very much looking forward to following 's all abilities dance company with concerts later this year called joltin directive we 're extremely grateful for the support of the Christchurch City Council and look forward to continuing to work and partnership with you the message conveyed by the council through their current financial support of the arts as a powerful one it makes an unequivocal statement about the importance that the creative sector plays in contributing to a lively and dynamic city that people are proud to live in we 're excited about the future eager to play our part and reflecting the energy vitality and creativity fishers Christchurch thank you thank you very much questions comments atom we are really man down on and I love and I always look for when you 're going to present whether it 's to a committee of wedding because you 're so busy in some lousiest ago you do you guys are doing so much so thank you and just with the schools etc coming to what you 're doing who covers that is that this the education department or is it you guys you mean the transport accounts actually very it 's a very big issue right now when we 're doing those concerts we 've got the full orchestra together it 's free of charge to attend the concert but the schools do have to pick up the the bus costs it 's been a bit tricky for us actually to do the full orchestra concerts for that reason ideally we 'd love to be doing them and sort of some bigger venues around the city so that ideally we can actually capture schools that can basically walk to them and it 's just a bit challenging at the moment but we as well as the full orchestra concerts that 's why we operate quite an active program of taking small groups into the schools so they 're not having to face that that transport charge I 'm just wondering that if you 're targeting schools and certain wards and I 'm my colleague Glenn mentioned to the previous speaker that you know to come to the community board maybe that 's something that you guys could come and talk to the community boards about getting looking 't counsel in itself ok oh I never said that on this you know obviously not an end you know I 'll forget that soon as I walk out of here that that 's our my great-great suggested thank you brief yeah thanks Gretchen for that and in your submission you say you 'd like CSO to perform once again in a fit-for-purpose concert facility what would you see as a fit-for-purpose constant facility yeah well I guess when we 're really talking about that we are talking about something with the primary purpose is for orchestral in acoustic music which is very different to the sports stadium or the air force museum or even the Isaacs which is really about more spoken word or amplified music and for us particularly vineyard capacity is really critical as well so right now we 're performing in the air force museum which has got a maximum capacity for us really around about sort of 870 so we 're looking for something that 's really the kind of place you want to go and its really sitting orchestral music and the beast and be looking at well we really feel that you know sort of anywhere around that sort of 1500 ish number is good it 's compromises all around we recognize that but we can make you know from 1500 up is good for us under 1500 that 's a challenge just from a yeah economic point of view but 1500 + is fine Thank You Becky on Tim 's Christian any of those concerts you 're providing for kids actually in venues in town are they at the theater were all or any of those ones we 've actually face real challenges getting dates into the Isaac visual and just the cost makes it really tough so and we 're actually doing the set of four concerts actually going to be in the Lonnie auditorium it in school so we 're often for these ones we have in to partner with schools I know where vicki was going with there I 'll get the free buses into town for four coming back into the city so if you get a venue in the city you be ah we can solve two yonni um I 'm really disappointed to hear that about the Theatre Royal as you 'll probably be aware that council put cancer walk amount of funding into the theatre royal fork to be used as a temporary facility for the orchestra so I think we need to get an urgent report on that I 'm really disappointed to hear that this case yeah I 'm sorry it 's just kind of off the topic of the long-term plan because it 's not a fondo it 's not now around there arts and around getting a bit you so I guess the question is do you think council needs to play more roll around temporary central city venues for you given the problems you Cameron I think actually probably for us at the moment and it will come down a lot to what the council decides around the permanent concert facility and therefore what the timeline might be around that you know because if we 're talking sort of a few years then we can probably soldier on but if we 're talking longer than that then I think we for that interim period at the cost of using the Theatre Royal yeah if that 's something that 's prohibited to you do you think we should be either considering giving you more funding to access it or should we be talking to the theatre royal to reduce those charges so that you can access them oh yeah that 's an interesting one because of course it does open up and then foot for all the users are probably going to be facing the same the same issues I think for us the big challenge is because it 's so expensive putting an orchestra on the stage that when we 're in a small capacity it means that the return is much more limited so we have to bridge the difference between what we can make and box and the extra cost to say to the concert more so no I 'm certainly not going to sit here and say that the council should should not give us some other more money or less learning because that of course helps us in and we can we can do more with that you 're looking at right now and will be shortly doing so thank you thank you very much perfect timing thank you cheers the next item on the agenda te Runanga o Ngai Tahu _"

    "text": "creative spaces trust come Morton good morning good morning tena koe to do you not go to dinner go to couture do you narc we 're near the end thank you very much the opportunity to address the council I 'm commotion and with me as Beth nobes we are both trustees of the auto Tawheed creative spaces trust we 're a new organization so I 'll just give a little bit of background about what we do and then some rice and key points for the council so our trust has been set up to make creative spaces and local communities in Christchurch and to provide people with opportunities to participate in creative arts there by having the chance to build connections with people in their local community so the venture has been set up in response to the compromised well-being in our community as you know following the earthquakes there 's unprecedented pressures on people 's well-being mental health services are stretched to new levels and significantly people who have had no experience of mental illness before crumbling under the pressures of rebuild rebuild and earthquake consequences so arts and the chance to be with others to connect in your local community so a Pegasus health literature review last year showed that participating in creative arts can result in significant health benefits including improve self-esteem confidence improve social connections and overall quality of life taking part in arts also enables people to take an active part in their own development and in the lives of their local communities so we 're not about setting up a big new art center in the central city we 're about partnering with local communities in their local areas to create opportunities for people to take apart the partnerships with local communities is really important to what we do we think that that increases access and makes it more possible for people to be part of it our approach is to work with mental health services and community advocates to connect people up who have the greatest need in our community with our projects our first projects have been printmaking workshops in New Brighton which have been really well attended oversubscribed and one day a week a group of people come together of the people we 're working with virtually speechless when they first come along they have been yeah they 've had really compromised well-being and over time they build up a sense of confidence working around others we have people that have moved from that state of sheer anxiety and terror about being part of a new group to exhibiting at land without Center and indeed one artist is selling sorry sending work to Australia for an exhibition another artist is enrolling in distance education and taking up to sri art study so we 're all about transformation and helping people on a journey from from a state of isolation and anxiety with support to move and achieve their goals and of course there 's a lot of benefits to the wider community of of that transformation just a tiny drink put in a word here mm-hmm I was listening to questions about assets and it occurred to me that we 're a brand-new little group but in fact the asset that we 're bringing in our in our little trust is our huge connectedness across the community so the Community Law Canterbury and from mental health advocacy and peer support and so this these groups touch multiple vulnerabilities and for myself I 've worked for over 10 years in an organization that supports people who use mental health and addiction services and I can absolutely attached to the difference it makes for person to be doing something positive and productive and effect been creative we 've watched the benefits to our population of floyds in the lynnwood community center and its really like having a service that 's at the top of the cliff for once instead of always cleaning up people 's difficulties great base the other project we are involved with is the new Phillipstown community hub and that 's a really exciting initiative in christchurch where their grief and sadness around the closure of the school has really been replaced with a sense of great ownership and excitement about a number of agencies coming together and forming a vibrant hub so we have a creative space in that hub and really looking forward to a lot of exciting with the local community and Phillip stand which we 'd like to acknowledge the support we 've already had from council we 've had a really wonderful support from your arts advisors and your community development advisors and that has had a significant impact on these speed with which we 've been able to set up and also funding through your community arts development fund so with that background laid out we would like to encourage the council to review the arts policy we feel that and it was written in 2001 I think and that it is not reflective of the current city and the challenges and opportunities that we have here in Christchurch we are very much looking forward to being part of that process we feel like that 's a foundation document that all the discussion that 's going on around the earth and the resources that are put into Earth that that would be well supported by a fresh look at the arts policy as you 'll know creative arts have played a really critical role in the recovery and reconnection of our communities following the earthquakes and we therefore asking the council to recovery in its arts policy we submit that art should be an embedded part of the council strategic goals and shouldn 't be kind of an add-on when it 's perceived to add vitality to the council 's image we certainly oppose any reduction to community arts funding but I think that 's been possibly clarified since the long-term plan was first put out our alko Papa is participation and access for disadvantaged people so I guess that is the lens through which we look at all of the proposals for for support to the Arts in the city we really urge the council to think about the connections between Arts and well-being when it reviews that policy we know that council resources are stretched we think that participatory arts should be prioritized by the council because of the extent of the compromise well-being following the earthquakes so we support a sharper focus on creative arts participation when the councillors thinking about its grants criteria and the arts sector and certainly there 's a lot of work being done internationally particularly in the UK about wellness policies in the value area of responsibility we also support and outcomes focused grants regime because we know that limited resources have to be prioritized some of the outcomes that we 're already seeing I 've sort of touched on this but from our print making workshops we 're seeing reduced social isolation without us attending workshops wrigley increased confidence and communication with others in the group artist stepping up to mentor and support newer members of the group development of art skills and readiness to apply for tertiary art study and group members having a say in the way things around and having a greater sense of empowerment over their lives we understand this fragmentation of arts funding within the city council and support the council taking a more coordinated approach where funding decisions are based on that foundation arts policy as I see it our workers with people who face major barriers to accessing creative arts opportunities and we therefore urge the council to look across all its major cultural institutions and arts initiatives to consider the barriers that people may face in accessing those services and how they might be addressed term plan the equity of access for major arts and cultural resources wasn 't was a little uneven and we just pointed out the city art gallery here could potentially take further steps that 's very interesting hearing the friends speak just before us but take through the steps to ensure that all members of the community are able to access the service I think about the men of the white wings trust at the Phillips town residential house for people with mental illness 27b excuses hostile or something the men who live in that house is a great divide between their experience in the community and being able to access places like the art gallery and the museum we 're up for helping and working with places like the art gallery to help make connections and open up access to people who don 't otherwise how much see thank you I 've got 33 counselors and so obviously we 're going to go over over time no no that 's okay it 's it 's not your problem so I 've got full term and Glenn thank you um for start like besides working with mental health services have you been able to obtain any funding from the dhp the DHB indicated when we did a feasibility study last year that this is unlikely to fit within their mutual community based funding but there is a conversation that we are continuing to have we 're looking very unwisely for funding and talking with places like the Tyndall foundation cantebury Community Trust has provided support and we have an the replication unto them so we are taking a very broad approach okay and I 'm not around council Fanning I 'm not suggesting any double dipping of counsel but are you aware that with the community boards they have some discretionary funding and especially when there are small localized projects that in fact they may be could consider some implications to thank you yep i 'm slightly final from what Phil 's been saying I guess you 've asked kind of more questions for the a cure for me rather than yourselves but with dealing with and the mental illness addiction and those that have enjoyed being hosted by our central government I mean I 'm just one DD there 's a lot of information on how art can help especially prisoners you 've got art in prison etc that you mentioned that before so I 'm just wanting that it 's a known fact so we 're not the only absolutely so our approach has been we have we 're supporting a project at the moment at Anne Ralston prison and which has been done by a volunteer who is one of our art workers we is our intention to talk with the Department of Corrections MST and probably others which don 't come to mind immediately about the potential contribution unfortunately the area of work that we are in is it kind of can easily fall between the gaps the DHBs don 't want to touch it because of that focused and central government is you 'll know are really tightening up the way that they funded organizations but I think you 're you 've raised really important questions about their responsibilities what are more questions and answers was sorry it 's a gleam thank you thank you community board with Pegasus I think that 'll be great you know I think I take note of what you said about participation which I suspect there 's why Peter majin DS words and others have been so well received because you know it 's the state participation and the art that really progresses but it would be good to the board Oh we 'd love to come and talk to the board yeah absolutely um we 're up for talking to anyone who 'll listen to us and if I can just finish on a note 2 and invite you all to the Phillips town community hub opening day on the twenty-third I know I 'm not supposed to do it and I 'll just leave those quietly via weaving a full day of submission leaving a full day of submissions on that day what time 's the opening we might be able to structure afraid to live until two in any case any time you 're most welcome to you know but that 's our last day of that 's our last day of hearings we 've she that we can get the whole lot done so yeah I think but thank you very much and thank you very much for all of your hard work I don 't know that we 're on anyway could we now _"

    "text": "hello my name is Christina and I 'm the president of the Friends of the Christchurch art gallery and with me as Peter skulls one of our life members Christchurch is a regional center and hub of the South Island it gains its identity from the history and creativity of the region and in turn provides cultural leadership the city also benefits economically from the activities that creative arts generate cultural events including concerts and exhibitions can be identified as individual economic generators but for them to be viable and enduring viable and strong underlying cultural structure is required key lighthouse drivers here are the museum and the art gallery well is to have a superficial similarity they have different strengths the museum is primarily about answers telling us about our past how we have been shaped and where we are at present the art gallery however is more about questions and offering new ways of seeing it raises questions that help us as a community to expand horizons question the present and look to the future good art in the words of Julian desh bar raises questions rather than challenging ideas that emerge from contemporary artists the gallery is a major contributor to ensuring that Christ Church does not lapse into insularity and introversion as a tourist draw card the gallery has a strong claim a dramatic building with a presence that makes it noticeable this has been built on with a strong acquisitions policy to Lord creativity that speaks to our development the friends want Christchurch to be recognised as having a vibrant arts and art activity society this will not only attract and encourage locals into the central city but encourage national and international tourists this will further add to the economic value the gallery has previously demonstrated that contributes to the city visitors to Christchurch that engage with the gallery come to be exposed to our creativity and how our artists are seeking to question the social ecology of our times after a strong and a strong public dynamic collection as a way for Christ 's use to develop traveling exhibitions that will reflect well on the city 's cultural heritage and future as stated in our written submission the gallery allows the citizens of Christchurch collection of Canterbury art in the world this not only educates but provides a touchstone for identity we live in uncertain in dynamic times recovery priorities restrict what can be achieved and dictate short-term stringent seas but the long-term plan will hopefully include a commitment to ensure the art gallery is a front of excellence and an example for the creative arts community and a contributor to the vitality of a modern and notable community thank you for your time thank you questions tim is that my question is with regards to just the the collection of Canterbury art and or any art piece what is the role of the art gallery for the population is to display in a sensitive way the art that hunters that you 're displaying the pandas are coming to see what is the difference between two and asking entrepreneurs or art collectors to leave or for you to borrow those pieces whilst are on display rather than owning pieces where they set perhaps and your vaults for some period of time unseen well I 'm speaking from the Friends we 're not the art is owning that it 's it 's something that is kept in perpetuity for the citizens of the community private art collectors l can on a whim or whatever cell within lost their artwork whether it 's with a new zealand draw it goes overseas and i think it is personally speaking and from the Friends perspective having a collection and christchurch is a valuable asset it 's only appreciating in value and we can draw on the different pieces to bring them out they 're not on the whim of whatever is current and fashion or whatever is and whatever current collectors are collecting yani if i can say also to as a punter and a collector i don 't really always like display more works and Pablo yeah and that 's the difference with these guys and the gallery can and do regularly display the works in public so that you can see Danny thank you um not sure how long you 've been involved for but I can recall when that girl was first built and then there 's been kind of a change in the last years before the earthquake and I think of things like the wrong York exhibition so I was wondering if you could just maybe give us a bit of a snapshot because it seems to me we built this big facility and it was very traditional and wasn 't really engaging and and just before the earthquakes a few years before the earthquakes it really had a change where was a lot broader a lot more attractive for people to come and experience and just wondered if you could maybe just reflect on on why the heck undo well they would be a question for the gallery stuff and the curatorial staff to answer we as friends we have we had a Steve membership all the time of the earthquakes and it was growing exponentially due to the collections and the displays that were put on we have kept a court membership since then who are really keen on the art gallery and what it has achieved and what will achieve once it reopens as to the design well that 's surely a council decision it wasn 't anything to do understand is because my recollection was that council decided to put some more money investing in two exhibitions coming into the art gallery and I guess what I saw was that the friends and others philanthropic people started to contribute a lot more and it meant that there was a real change in the focus with that little bit of extra council investment we got a huge return but while speaking from the Friends point of view we have always been generous donators to the gallery regardless of where they were right back to the times of the ROM mcdougal and into the current we 've always had a fundraising event or something where we have contributed to contemporary works for them to purchase sorry mmmm so with a more philanthropic persons and organizations have got on board well you 'd have to ask them why they have suddenly decided to example Thank You Jimmy you 'll teach you based on your word reputation particular emphasize the importance of art gallery and different a function of art gallery in the museum but also the particular you know the Central Council of phase the isolation I just want to know that whether you are you think that 's a property or not are you happy or acceptable regarding council secure party in the long term plan for the tool repair we build that is hockey well obviously it was a grand opportunity for the gallery to having been in the gallery for ten years mind you three to four of that was because they 've been out of it because of earthquake they could have reorganized it but due to funding priorities that was they 've just had to patch job what had to be done and the only significant investment since the earthquakes as the base isolation which is significant investment and will carry the gallery forward so and as I said and the submission that it gives security to donors aimed to people weren 't wishing to loan works that it 's all not going to come down thank you thank you very much check the next submission is the _"

    "text": "stop thank you very much good morning and welcome jindie is that speaking to our submission I 'm little of course David cell and I 'm chairman of arts Canterbury incorporated and Christine is the secretary treasurer and we 're a charitable organization was about 100 to 150 members nearly all of them of whom are artists and galleries does which to highlight a few points from our written submission the first I think it 's a particularly important one and that is that the Arts in Christchurch need to be seen as integral to the social economic and cultural well-being of the people of Christchurch and not just an add on the second point I 'd like to point out is it in the long term plan the draft there it 's not very clear as to what art and culture is and there needs to be a much clearer definition of this in the plan itself I thought it rather bizarre to see for example environmental education as being in half and culture that hella just one example of it and then also once the definitions are established to build a strategic statement on the arts as the basis for long-term planning and so that 's my third point and on a more practical level as far as those concerned with the ants on the city there must be a more coordinated funding policy there 's no doubt that the arts are lively arts and presence in any culture is can really never be self-supporting I know we would love it if the Graduate symphony orchestra for example could pay for itself we don 't love it but the reality is a cat and neither can the court theatre and so on so there must be some kind of funding policy and as an organization that has in fact been on both sides of this of the funding of the Arts we have had often been in the position of not knowing who or thought to apply for in order to obtain some financial support our written submission in fact offers a model and I won 't go over that because it is in the written submission there but it 's a three-tiered funding structure for the support to follow other people in this room much more competent to work out the details of such a structure also as far as I 'm concerned I 'm not sure whether christine has anything to add to what I 've said our organization is aware of and applauds the work of the city that the City Council already carries out in the art arena we 're also aware that there are many I suppose you could call them sit on hidden contribution us that the council makes for example such matters as the provision of facilities which of course can be used by the Arts in which the council already provides there are many of those when we consider those terribly important and especially at this time when we 're all meeting a challenge and the excitement quite frankly of reconstructing a city and all its facilities and I 'm thinking here of the of the Christchurch art gallery of course which incidentally is one of our members and the crisis in from the orchestra the core theater the Christchurch music music theatre just something I was piano the the one of our great successes in the city and the contributions that the City Council has made to all of these and many others is certainly noted thank you thank you um did you want to say I think is one david has a seat at all but I just want to stress that the apps are really an integral part and capital letters of the of the Christ huge public I mean neither of us are artists incidentally we 're not pushing your own barrows David and I both heavily involved in music and but but we just see the arts generally just so necessary and and we totally can 't go it alone thank you well perhaps I could start off by saying that having now heard it I can I can literally say it 's music to my ears because what you 've identified as something that I think structurally we could take on board I don 't like the fact that when I drilled into arts and culture i found the libraries i found all these other things you mentioned the the environment school component or disconnected approach to art so i think that 's something that we can take on board as a as a council and look at the way that that component is structured but your concept of a funding structure that actually combines what the council can contribute and it is limited and to what we can contribute to a combined approach with what others contribute to me that 's what 's music to my ears because that 's exactly the kind of model that we want to move to and in terms of our own resilient communities or strengthening communities approach to to grants funding is to look to who are the other funders and to see whether the combined approach can actually produce a much better outcome but also a more secure outcome and you 're you 're seeking line items for for obviously out well I guess that our cultural infrastructure our Symphony Orchestra theatre professional theatre you know all of these things are part of who we are as a city so you 've come with us with a proposal that actually looks to integrate the council allocation better result for the city as a whole am I am i hearing the music right it 's that does that play right you you are very much I 've served I think too short terms on the creative communities panel and I I can remember when it first started and Gary Moore that was before he was more mayor I was the chairman and I said well why can 't the City Council subsidize a vector that is already there that is in creative communities and it saves another my TV yeah apart from anything else and hooray for their yeah no I mean I 'd rather look out at what is already there rather than creating something new it 's actually a similar conversation that we recently had with them I think it was Sarah wasn 't it looking at funding public art creating another structure and I 'm going we 've already got scape we 've already got the public info at advisory group you know so why on earth would you create another structure so so I 'm thinking along exactly those tombs yani thank you which is good and provide some ways forward but just you mentioned the symphony orchestra music center the court theatre in the theatre royal and I just kind of wanted to check in with you over the Performing Arts precinct because do you feel that is really being enough public engagement opportunity collaboration with that that the wide arts and cultural sector around what that should look like could look like could be would you know is do you think there needs to be more thought given to that whole precinct in terms of who 's involved who funds what who contributes what and what the purpose of it is I think that should always be sit have ongoing thought given to those and in fact in the submission that I prefer where I 've spelled out rather more of the sort of thing I suggested a kind of standing committee here all of what you will about which is a representative committee from the city including of course councillors arts authorities and you know we I think we know pretty well many of the bigger names and in the thinkers who could be contribute to them to that kind of concept I think that that arts Advisory Committee got a big tech from me as well so I just think that that that the proposals that you put that you 're not asking the council for to put more money on the budget you 're actually asking the council to do things in a much more collaborative and open way and I think that works for us but I 'm sorry the 10 months is up there Phil I 'm sorry but thank you very much for your submission and we will certainly take on board the issues that you have raised thank you I 'm sorry but I think it would be helpful that we have opportunity to ask the questions and then pets that we make comments around it I would like to see a process so that in fact what you know I got my question it was only one council to put their hand out I had my hand up for quite a while you put your hand up after this after the question was minutes was up that your hand when tapped so know what okay well I 'm going to allow you to ask a question since you don 't believe thank you and look thank you for your submission it 's detailed up one of the one of the groups of people sometimes who often are not included around say consideration of Arts I think as children and young people and so I 'm just thinking with the Christchurch School of Music in terms of the structure you 've suggested would there be a place for that organization to oh yes you could easily get me into a much longer term of speech here because I 'm very much I 'm essentially a music educationist that is my position or was my position at the University and of course I said all them very much and I would like to think that it would be included it still has to be separated of course from the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education when it comes to that thank you thank you very much for your time and could we now invite the red cliffs public library Suzanne Craig _"

    "text": "I know that this is a little bit unorthodox but it seemed to me that now that we 've all had an opportunity to hear what each other has had to say that might be a good opportunity to kind of reflect on the sort of you know sort of reports or advice that I mean I think you 've heard me sort of kind of indicate the type of reports that we 're going to be giving as a follow up on this and staff have been taking careful note of the issues as they 've been raised but you know having listened to some of the others you know is there anything that you would kind of like on reflection say I wished I 'd raise that Sarah I think that one thing that comes out quite strongly across the boards as around communication and sometimes the things happen at council level enter his staff and then project things that are happening that affect our wards and we don 't know about them and it really had to be involved in to give like good local information and and it 's happened a few times recently that things that men should be mentioned today as well as over the last year or so also that as we 're moving hopefully towards a more community governance model using the community boards in that way will be really really valuable and it will save time in money to involve boards in the community much earlier in the process as early as possible but what 's been the reaction to the shift of the strengthening communities staff away from the building here and out into the community boards areas and to the soother centers or we 've always had some staff and Ecker i but yeah it works incredibly well having your staff sitting beside you understanding and having people that actually come from our communities in those roles now it 's very important to have many eyes looking at what 's going on Andrea and I have discussed a couple of times the fact that with our Ward 's still feeling that the earthquake strain in a lot of ways we 're actually both losing a strengthening communities advisor post-quake three her ward and that 's no longer going to be the case and I think our communities are really going to feel that our communities are it the most stressed have been right now the group to their needing more help um so this wondering if there might be some other parts of counsel to which might join that you know like those community teams and like one that i mentioned to to be able Pegasus border around local flood defence planning for two events and emergency events but there are people staff working on there and I think as they visit the walk the walk boards you know it 's a sensual in fact that you tap into them and vice versa we used to say that so it just is the scope there is it an example maybe you know of some other examples too we 're in fact that team concept can be developed we used to have a green space consultation leader based at the beginning service center and it would be it would be great if we could have some you know green space that 's a good idea yeah I say I think sometimes the rest of council doesn 't use and the rest of the council structure doesn 't use that the strengthening communities team very well and we noticed that really recently audience mate at the last meeting we had we mentioned the fact that something had happened about the wards looking at what profiles those kind of things that was developed from a from a section of council and no one ever asked the strengthening communities already put that stuff together yeah and I think that sometimes that step gets mussed and I think that yeah within that organization structure that needs to the basic utilized and that will save time and money it 's really pleased to hear that civil defense is now part of that community governance structure so be great to have civil defense representatives if i don 't know i don 't have no idea how big that team is i 'd be great to have do civil defense planning at award level so the defense would have more volunteers on its database than any other know but that 's an usher around civil defense not being you know yep anyway but look yeah yeah but it was just really to sort of say you know that it some initial feedback and we 're hearing yes but please some more yes okay um mine haven 't the good old days we used to have traffic engineers in air and air service out and we even had enforcement staff and their services as well that was when things work really really well and you could get a lot of problems solved without going through reports through five different layers of the council and I just hope that consideration can be given to there any new structure to include that so that it involved start back to service centers to work with community boards at true grassroots level would be able as long as as long as nobody quotes me to Hugh publicity I like the idea of having smaller community councils you know community boards being like community councils and then with the city having their over arch and governance and roll balls but they wonderful took all about them boards certainly we had local stuff and then it was the decision was made to centralize yeah thing which I think was retrospective and totally agree totally agree um yani glen le um thank you I think it 's a really interesting question about how we localized service delivery one of the things that none of you have really touched on has been the resources required to be involved in strategic and land use planning with the new awards and I just wondered whether you know we 've talked about having strengthening community staff we 've talked about having technical staff no one 's mentioned the need or even raised an issue about how you feel about how you 're involved in land use planning and I just wondered if there was a comment from you on that well we had play space planning for poor little river and I mean as a community board chair and our board we have no trouble and getting staff to come to work for us or come to work it not to work for us to work alongside us I that you need to we need to be able to ask for staff to come and support us through what it with whatever it might be whether it 's civil defense real fires or whether it 's a note play space planning or whatever it is we 've just got to ask I think that issue I think the issue at the moment is of the district plan review which is a truncated process and our staff are conflicted because they can 't go and present evidence and provide support for the community boards to give it which is why additional funding was made available so the external planning support could be made available to assist the community boards it 's not yeah but what we haven 't that great hey yeah thank you I mean there isn 't going to be look hours and hours and hours of consultancy work available but it is to enable you to submit on the phase 2 and phase 3 notifications so the phase 2 notifications have just happened so that 's so you 're going to need some support now for making close on that haven 't_''_548.64 got that off the top of my head but be alert to that okay and this end of the stage three ones we 're just sent off to the ministers so that they are still sort of a few weeks away before we publicly notify them but we deliberately put aside some resource to support the community boards because we didn 't have time to engage with our communities on the whole question of the of the second and third chapters of the district plan like I guess sorry if I just need your question here and there is a real issue with with us anyway I 'm working over the last over the last three years we 've been asking for involvement in and so the involvement at the earliest possible sages of any major developments an area is so that we can then put into it and it still hasn 't happen I was at a meeting this morning we 're developers or person selling their property to a developer the developer had a nice to care drove through the through the through say no we can 't have that we 've got to a straight road which means that you know it 's a race track through there now but it 's all that sort of thing that we would like to have some input in not as consultants for just to give a view on major developments of testing in our area so that we can get a bit of results at the end of the day rather than be in big proactive and Leanne rather than reactive yeah I mean up I mean I think this is all very useful I can 't remember who I said that would oh can I just finish I 'm just in terms of but we just went through the Levi skate park and I was shocked to hear that our stuff it 's been 70 thousand dollars with a time on a hundred and eighty thousand dollar project so it seemed to me there 's something really wrong with our system um are you guys wait we end up and cool thank you are you seeing a lot more than there you know our operational costs in terms of consultants and staffing to provide a more localized form of of consultation I think the board involved at the earliest reports and food yep you need a possible yeah glendaleaz oh this is great what we 're doing right now first time I 've seen in four and a half years and it 's a model that was proposed I think by the company council where they have the community board chairs to the council I don 't think you get a vote but i 'm just wondering whether we did this occasionally how feasible practically you would find it giving you other commitments to come council meetings I think the more time that we spend talking to you guys the better listing so many things come out of today that I didn 't know about is a that would give us that would nervous a bit close early ya know as bored cheers is it a bit like this a lot of what you 're talking about is in fact some unclear processes or not being included in these processes and the decision-making it could be some strengthening of the strength and communities concept we 're probably not going to be able to afford a whole lot more staff or at once so is it sort of like to make to ensure them fact at the suburban level and community boards that in fact it is working better but particularly by better information flows and we probably have to work very hard of it yeah I don 't think more staff as that that 's how we allocate but that 's not our job but carlene 's been sitting here very carefully to Ali did you hear you 're just very very quickly one thing that 's clear to me too after having been to feel from y mari and burwood Pegasus service centers or the officers in the last couple of weeks it 's a huge range in quality of resources and space and if because I love this idea of the getting back to the local you know the hubbing if you like got to be fit for purpose Robin so there is going to be a cost related to bed to meet you know because it was very clear this last couple of weeks to make ya know I think that 's important um alright I 've pen well I 've am I didn 't get my five sets with on the sale of reserves and property and I did whisper and rare sea air about it and and then a lot of notice a lot of our boards areas will have perhaps may have spear land that has not terribly valuable well as yet is valuable but it 's not terribly valuable for uses what they 've been designated like we 've got the power reserves we might have sections that are that somewhere in a bit of a different place maybe we could look could we look at that and look at doing something with it we 've had a look on we pets might have had about 3.8 million that we can actually identify just at this quick stage of land that we could not flick but become a little dirty bit yeah and it 's hoped that it pets might come back to the some of some of those things like the wolf work and the thing is that that it can so what we 're asking that the staff does to put together a report on it it won 't be in every instance that we 'd want to but we 've already got on our budget 50 million dollars worth of land sales so if we don 't get the 50 million dollars on our budget we 've got a problem so you know the land sales are part of our whole looking at our asset base and looking at what needs to be divested and looking at current purpose as against you know at the original allocation you know that 's also got a thought thank Paul it 's got a hand up first yes I know we haven 't got we haven 't got reserves on our on our list but all I was saying was that if we don 't get the 50 million for the land then obviously if reserves are locked debt that are not required you know we 're not talking about hagley park we 're not talking just to make it crystal clear that not all the land that we have and ownership is for sale Paula well sorry about what what Paula say me first that we knew of its aim was in the economic local rag sorry what named now what I have seen that either must be miles away yeah we haven 't_''_996.41 we haven 't actually made any decisions about actual parcels of land that it 's been here we can 't sell reserve Lin without going through a process right well just is an example this and fit is a fee simple pack and send them there 's a whole bunch of controversy over at the moment if once there 's a policy change they would just go without any consultation what do you mean but we 're not changing the reserves act no it 's not a reserve its fee simple with its it 's how it 's not yeah it 's freehold it 's not it 's not a reserve it 's a pack but it 's not a reserved but I 've got no idea where that information came 't seen it in the hotel for a year but they 're worth it it 's a whole crisis it goes on yeah just like groans cell 09 yeah we 've all a lot can we just all agree that the activity management plan process was an objective a Lea and we 're going to come up with something that 's a lot better than that next time if if any of us are still here so right so look thank you very much I think that it 's been incredibly helpful I think that we 've raised a number of issues that people will be able to chew over we 'll get some detailed reports on some of the specifics that our community billboards have focused on and you know all of you are representative of your communities and I think that your community should be very proud of the amount of effort that has gone into presenting to us today not just the presentation but the detailed work that 's gone on in an advance so on behalf of your residents of your wards thank you very very behalf of our suspects about 40 I don 't care hear what I 'm saying on behalf of us and board chairs look could we thank you for the incredible support that we actually receive in Christchurch City Council the staff you 're addicted members we appreciate all the on-ground sessions that we 're getting we 're getting a lot more feedback things are different and a huge accolade to our local staff know in every corner we 've got staff that are working challenging situations and we really doing need to acknowledge their very hard work that they 're um tendering to us to ensure that we can get the best out of a bad team dear square so no thank you for saying that and thank you all and on that note I will declare the meeting closed june i 'll declare the meeting adjourned _"

    "text": "last but certainly not least syndrome I 'm re needle last ones right welcome thank you thank you thank you mayor and councillors for this opportunity to speak to a submission I 'll start off with our key issues and the first one was the rates we acknowledge you 've got significant challenges but we are concerned about the level of proposed rates increasing year-on-year as identified on the plan we have people that are asset rich and cash poor and they are genuinely generally generally concerned about how they actually don 't manage to pay the rates so as I consume we 've also got a wonderful lowest dis ol areas and Christchurch being Brenna and jelly park so it affects them as well and we thought that perhaps the AI am I stadium should be good not on this long-term plan but looked out after this long platoon plan and the Essex sales and we know that they have to be considered to be sold in part but we would like to go the assets sales to go to Pavel service bodies as a post into the private just for s itself but that 's part of the debate yes yes and the capital program in the roads of national significance that really affects our ward and all the downstream road improvements we have to do on all our intersections coming into town both on he would road and memorial f memorial even one part is only two lanes and there could be talk and future of four laning met that bet part which would cost the council a lot of money and I 'm sure it 's not in the near future but it would have to happen sometimes with the closing of wire rack erosion even he drove we 're putting a lot more traffic onto memorial if it 's going to put a lot of pressure on to more moral ever right onto field ruin road and then to the city that that impt runs that way and also here but wrote will take a lot more traffic as well the increasing the contribution of Greater Christchurch local bodies to the christchurch city rebuilt we feel that some of the outer local bodies perhaps should city has to rebuild and those councils are actually going to use like the commander convention centers not canceled its government but like those the metropolitan sports center and those sort of friends that they perhaps will come undone use so we feel that perhaps they could be contributing as well as well the differential chargin I think that 's Ralphie self-explanatory and the level playing fields of the mobile coffee kervens in the city we worry about those not having to pay rates like the cafe 's that are moving into the city do it have to pay rates and it is not really a level playing field if you leave them at the the post-earthquake rates that they have been getting there should be going back to pre youthquake weights because those carotenes can cap just coming on sunny days and busy days and they 're really just packing the cream out of the market in that instance in the residential red zone we notice that there 's a lot being expended on maintenance for the few houses that are left and let a red zone and it out so you the council doesn 't have the cost of maintaining the roads and the infrastructure and that 's a battle thank you does anyone else want to comment Oh Monty ah yes and we support McMorris comments about the quarries there is a huge problem at the papyrus and will be ongoing and so as much as can be done with the monitoring whatnot would be really good yeah I 'm sure that you 'll be supporting submissions to the hearings panel on the on the quarry 's chapter all right do we have any questions yep thanks for your team look around the AC it sells I just see you 've also made a recommendation that if if assets have to be sold there 'll be some form of you 've got public civil service ethos or restriction but that 'd be legally embody just wonder if one of you might like to expand on that a wee bit just to say hello we sort of thought that perhaps some of the other local bodies could take up some of those shears and the assets so there what you really it was the example that came up before the Ryan 's already eleven percent owned by he 's so understood Council what 's the problem was so on picking up some more shares and that would I mean you could always protect that interest by saying they could only ever come back well I mean we have the first right of refusal on this year 's anyway so if they wanted to sell the eleven percent that they didn 't want we 'd have the first right of refusal at the moment we wouldn 't have the money to buy them so we would actually end up seeing that does appear so and that would be problematic in my view the ssl issue is so complicated that I don 't think we totally understand how you 're going to do it so they 're just our thoughts I think that I mean what we 've said is is that we can 't possible imeem we don 't know what different she is packages of worth I mean obviously you know if you sell control then that 's then if you don 't sell control but there is a there is a line you know and Toronto you know the region of Tirana they sold forty-four percent of this year 's at the time they sold they were valued at a dollar five a sheer now they 're valued at about seventeen dollars a share so I mean you know the amount that the regional council gets for forty four percent of an asset is way more than it used to give for a hundred percent of its asset you know but I mean there 'll be other issues involved in all of this and of course Tara long as having an impact on our port with with what it 's done in Timaru so we 're faced with a number of risks but and that 's why we 're thinking that perhaps rather than just debating yes or no on asset sales are there some strategic opportunities that could actually grow the the strength of the region as against some of those other things that are happening at the moment I mean like Auckland Airport has brought alone and somebody made the point earlier on about how we didn 't want to DB just on the receiving end of Auckland well we 're not even there they 're bypassing us all together and there 's an issue Glen thank you this might stray into being out of order but it 's nothing too well because it 's the last submission of the evening and if and I feel alright I 'll be really quick just a comment followed by a question I don 't think we can legally remove people off the roads I mean and it was technically an offer anyway but have you as a board discussed the concept of a flat water facility and with a you 'd support that no okay we haven 't even discussed it so we don 't really have an opinion unless any of the other state I think that I mean picking up on that red zone because you 're actually the ones that have raised us about expending the costs that it 's expending on the maintenance of services and infrastructure to a few properties which is horizontal infrastructure spend the government 's contributing X percent and we 're contributing the other so 6040 but but that 's coming off the horizontal infrastructure agreement you know so and i find that deeply disturbing because quite frankly it 's the method that was chosen by central government and they should be paying 100 percenter shouldn 't be something that the council 's picking up at all and i mentioned earlier on about how you know 15 million dollars with a social housing asset which on a net basis in terms of what we got back from insurance is about eight million dollars did not get transferred from central government to the council so we 're eight million out of out of pocket and I cannot for the life of me understand how on earth that was included in the cost sharing agreement it makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever and I think that the that all of these issues we 're always going to get surfaced in this long-term plan process but I 'm so I 'm really pleased that you raised it it does need to out calling for people to submit on the development of a draft plan because they 've been doing a recovery plan our X number of years down the track to deal with the last remaining and dividuals when in fact what they 've asked for and the court has agreed to is the same pay out as everyone else and the point that I 'm making is that day people in that situation are not and not being you know forced out of it well that asked us to settle with the government because they were uninsured or couldn 't get insurance because they had empty sections they 're being asked to their being asked to to take up an offer simply on the basis that it 's been red zoned so it 's it 's actually the decision of the government that has put them in this position not the fact that they were uninsured if they hadn 't been red zone dem were uninsured habitat for humanity would affects their houses as they 've done for many uninsured Green Zone properties and in fact I went to one nails into the wall as part of the total repair job that they did free of charge for people who were uninsured not because they selfishly wanted to hold on to their money and not end to take the risk of being uninsured but because the husband was in hospital for over six and his wife couldn 't afford to pay the bill so there are real stories real human stories behind the residential red zone and I 'm so glad that you raised it here because the people of Christchurch are having to pay the price anyway and I think that all the government needs to do now is to make the offer the same as they did to everyone else but that turned out to be a speed I didn 't mean to be quite emotional about it because it just seems so unfair that people think that they 've been that that somehow there in the position that their own because they wanted to be or desire to be or chose to be there the stories that I have heard about why people weren 't insured and start building next week you know the week after the earthquake they are treated with a 50-percent offer for their lane people who started building the day of the earthquake are covered by the hundred percent offer it 's ridiculous yani so try not to give a speech either but honestly the reason the countless on ailana go see any and go by the red zone was because government offered to pay for building the convention center so that 's a really simple answer and but you 're saying you want us to Bobby government to conclude negotiations for the households but are you aware that actually it 's a voluntary offer so even if government concludes its negotiation so if people still have a right to live there and to develop and get building concedes and you know so I 'm just wondering whether you 've thought about actually what you 're asking and we know I think Jana you 'll find that the residential red zone recovery plan will actually address the whole issue now in a way that the voluntary offer didn 't so that 's I at this point um could I am by any of the board chairs that would like to come back and and and join us at the table I don 't know whether any of you would like to take the opportunity to to come back and we 'll just have a final sort of 10 minutes and and finish at seven thirty at that 's all right _"

    "text": "barely Pegasus thank you very men and counselors as you can see with some scissors here and board chair and I achieve the submission committee and have to say it 's very very active and totally committed to process of us we 're going to do things just a little bit different and that we want to talk about the ward specifics we 've got critical recovery needs and there are three that we have itemized i 1 i 'll talk to end Andrea and Tim I 'll also talk to the other to the board wishes to enforce the concerns conveyed by its community noting the large number of submissions received from within the bare wood pegs us-ward and we 're very conscious of that we 'd like to recommend that the council consider that the proceeds of the sale of part of qe2 park to the ministry of education and other potential sale of land be invested back in the booooored Pegasus hoard for the purposes of three the first being the proposed Eastern recreation and sports complex at QT park with additional cool space to meet the the two proposed relocated high schools on the same site we 'll talk further about how we could do that so I 'll hand over to Andrea she 's going to talk about New Brighton yeah great so as you probably know New Brighton as being a fairly am engaged and the MTP process I believe last week you guys approved the DA Development Authority so this possibly changes a little bit what we put in our submission but we just want to really to support that the new brighton legacy project and finding ways to enable that to happen I our concern is actually some flooding in South Shore we 've had a problem that some of the sea wolves that were designed to hold the land and fell over into the sea because they weren 't designed to hold to CN consequently the area where read the sea wolves are salt still down the foundations have been bulldozed away which is let the sea coming on extreme events now I 've had many meetings with Sarah and council and both saved each other 's problem meanwhile we 're a lot for somebody not sure who the landlords are exit the stage because there 's paper wrote on front which confuses the issue so some lens going onto the paper road so it 's the difficulty the people down there obviously very very concerned because this has been going on for a year now put the talking better to and fro we need it fixed we feel like we 're a flood risk that can be averted we had the Caspian street ebbtide Street done and we 're extremely grateful they come out for the fantastic council got onto that with the flood management plan we would like something like that continued or some form of protection and I must say we hit a meeting on build something I from the wrist Association had a meeting on Friday with Ramon strong and 10 power from Sarah and I feel that we 've made some progress but I really would like your support to get this done quickly we 're going into a winter period we do get southerlies we do get more rain and it is something that could a lot of problems thank so we 'll move on for capital works proposed for the ward item 4 24 actually do you want me to read all these or just pay no no no we bred them but okay so it 's a question of what do you really want to highlight the throwing that we 've just talked about yep okay and also as far as City wider shoes item 1026 board recommends deferral of the council contribution of 235 million towards the former ami stadium complex rebuild and instead investigate and accept a repair program based on independent engineering valuation we 've had an independent engineering evaluation done for a claim with our insurer and it is not able to be repaired in an economic way and our insurance company doesn 't agree with us so what happens now we are working with our insurance company flood protection which we have now we 'll come back to that because that 's danger is going to talk about that under what you still plan yeah it is an item and the board supports non privatizing and recommends for look at selling non-strategic assets such as the setlist land city can enable orion red bus ahead of strategic assets and i think that 's going to be covered a little bit more by andrea at first the only two strategic assets in your other port and the airport not necessarily though but you said sell enable Orion yeah city care enable Orion red bus so what time 75% of them was what did you want lived what did you regard as strategic assets not to touch I think was more of an example yeah the ones we haven 't read the port and the airport support for other organizations in our ward rapidly golf course which has been very strenuously supported within the community so the board strongly supports retention of that golf course and the club and the council to give consideration to the proposal from graffiti club committee and members to administer and maintain the proshop golf course in golf club given council and that 's you the council will be considering a paper that recommends that we go out to tender in order to test the a golf club tenders for that that the issuer 's that had been at no cost to the ratepayer so maintaining a golf club for both you know ray player expenditure and I understand that our staff have been working with the rough 80 golf club and that they are very keen to take over but we have to go through a open procurement process in the same for me playing the same for South you brushing that 's probably happened since we 're doing our submission yes it has and I do apologize for that I mean effect I should just take a minute and just explain what happened so it was done through the activity management plan process and people weren 't allude to the fact that these remained and their activity management plans when they were signed off and unpublished and all right so I took legal advice as to whether we could infect revert reverse that decision prior to the conclusion of the whole process and we got a legal advice saying that we couldn 't deal with it until we get to the end of 'll get all of the information that we need so that the council can actually make a decision at the end of the at the end of the long term plan process so if the decision is that the rough et golf club wants to run the course and there is no cost to the right player then we are in a position to accept that and but but we won 't timing-wise probably be in a position to deal with South New Brighton but it wasn 't her it wasn 't a closure it was a no cost to the ratepayer provision so I 'm hopefully we 're going to get to the point where we 'll be able to make a decision on it at the same time as the long-term plan and not go out for a public you know cool of expression of interest after we 've made a decision to do that if you see what I mean so that 's why we brought it all forward so it can all be dealt with by the end of the month thank you end of next interrupt and just explain that that 's okay the coastal pathway which with itemized there as well the coastal pathway group will be submitting on Thursday and we 'd like to support that you know what that will do is close the loop of what ways in the ward once the what way around the avin happens that that would be a major asset for the ward because anywhere in the ward would be able to hop onto that walkway it 's quality of life issue and I think be really appreciated by the resonance and now the other I wanted to touch on how we how we could fund pools in the water and we are able to increase the size of the scope that we have at present is the land action too let 's pick on in the community that has said well why can 't we have the money but makin to the poorest rather than leave the east and the debtors an issue that residents feel quite saw about the fact that there 's nothing that piers darling there 's nothing happening but there 's we understand is under expression of interest right now well there was a decision taken by the community board and it 's not a decision that 's been supported by the council no they 're not allowed to it hasn 't but it 's a it 's a metropolitan asset so they can 't even sign the sign the lease so it 's got to come back to council anyway and I 'm you know the council made a decision at the time that we were aware that the community board had received a deputation making it crystal clear that we didn 't want anything happening and the contiguous areas to the residential red zone while the residential red zone itself was under consideration if we reinstate the natural run of the river to put a water course in there how on earth is there going to be a park and that you know a sports facility in the middle of that park so it really does need to wait but I don 't know why the decision was made to go out to a tender when it 's not we 'll we 'll we 'll deal with that when it comes back to council just feels like going to I 'm speaking for myself here that we 're not not consulted well that 's an asset now lord no no but metropolitan assets and you understand matters that can be dealt with by community boards so I 've asked the question as to how we 've ended up with a situation that a community board can call for an expression of interest when they can 't make the decision it seems rather circular to me but of course you 'll be consulted about it because the future use of the residential red zone is going to be consulted and one way shape or form and meanwhile we 're in a holding pattern waiting that 's right we 're all in a holding pattern as far as the residential red zone goes if we 've already heard that the government is going to produce a residential red zone recovery plan under the legislation and you know as much about that as i do great frustrate age very frustrating md yeah 'm just a couple of ones I 'd like to raise on page 119 item number 19 3 2 1 then we breaking master plan another of the great master plans that come along and then seemed to not of each eight we would like some some additional funding put in to enable that and we 've offered a solution the year of some of the money from the Avon attack or a route cycle way we believe that with the redesigned decisions being a long way off that 's premature they have a budget set in stone there when we don 't even know where you know what that land is going to be used for me the route will be those types of things is also concerned the cycleway will go will be very much around following the river whereas most residents who commute will take pages road to straight road to get to where they want to go so that there 's a lot of work to be done before that it 's like a way begins so we 'd like to see that the master plan page that the board of chris the 19 million dollars from the museum redevelopment capital grants be spent on immediate foot part but foot powerful peers we 're health and safety is an issue both my children have been hospitalized on the last 18 months without path accidents i see so many misses or near misil you know nemesis and in trips and i 've tried to find out the steps from the emergency department how many people are coming in with footpath injuries and in the East because there is so many years that so many parents don 't leave their children out to walk or to scooter because they just had a clue just can 't avoid excellent I guess we just you know that that 's something that we 're I 'm really passionate about Afghanistan with a broken left on the daughter with a head injury and nobody wants to see their kids being continuously injured have enough not to mention quality of life you know a dolt residents I want to go out for walks a lot of people just don 't_''_915.56 anymore because it and so many places you have to walk out onto the road hardsex pletely impossible so that that 's something we would like I think you all would would have this worse than any other war i and and I sing for the call long time before I was me that there was going to be a commitment made to at least allow one side of the road to be accessible but and you 've got mums with prams you 've got kids on trikes and you 've got elderly people on their motor scooter I 'm and I heard one the other day who 'd actually sold their them them made up as good or whatever it 's called that the yeah I can 't remember what like why I had to rescue so many mobility scooter she sold it because she can 't use that use it yeah and actually that means she 's trapped in a house and that 's on the parklands part of your ward so there are huge issues that we 've got to deal with them and your ward so we 're about budget for that and that one we asked for the 19 million deferral from the museum redevelopment no no how much app sorry your ass sorry where is love at the very bottom lock but very bottom paragraph of page 119 I don 't know you can 't do there so no no but you 're wanting 19 million dollars to be put on the on the budget I mean at least I think that I mean there is a lot of footpaths to be repaired so in not just we 're not just talking here lon cracks we 're talking major part well I presume that these are doing it about but I presume that there 's a two-tier process because there 's no point fixing the roads if the houses still aren 't fixed you know or a still being rebuilt but I mean I used to be a concrete Kerber there is wasted pre exactly so as I basically you probably need some money on budget for temporary repairs but that 's also going to require an assessment of how that 's going to be done because is an absolute priority for the ward there is just no question in my mind and let 's not look at how you think that perhaps you could fund that I think we need to get a report on how much funding is actually required for temporary repairs to footpaths and then permanent repairs and also is out of a strategy where foot paths cross roads there 's a lot of cases where that they understand to sections I really hazardous yes I mean this is a huge issue for your ward and I 'm really pleased that you 've raised it it 's you 're not the only person that 's going to be raising it and it 's really really important and I think that both counselors or I mean I 'm sure they 're not taking into account their own particular wards interests over the rest of the city but you cannot you cannot see the city divided like this it 's absolutely imperative that we get money into this part of the budget in some parts of the ward where we are still awaiting sewer yet other areas that 's been has been highlighted that certainly near the immediate 40 years but it can be temporary so I think that we need to get a report on temporary fixes in terms of footpaths so that people can get around you know if people can 't get from the house down to the local shops then there 's something fundamentally wrong people Weir 's down the track from from pages right they can 't get into your bright blue when you buy from us to down Baker Street things you cannot get into New Brighton without yep offer idea okay so sorry for interrupting but there are the issues that you want a particularly highlight I think those are just just sorry I 'm not full with it with it hey suicidals oh yes I well I mean yeah we 've heard a lot you 've got a lot today about the People 's Choice clean the board support and principal most of the key strategies I think would sort of spelt out reasonably clearly one of us are things was they gasp the government to use repairs of road to gain at the same sort of weak as all right yeah we have meant to do that so I found that out since get it today I 'm just really looking for is there any well I think we 've got the issues around the Lord so I think we 'll go to questions alley gleam fell thank you i had a question probably directed at you LeAnn just to clarify because a number of submissions have talked about using that 19 million dollars let 's see that for the museum trusting you can yep can you aren 't can you explain it I mean well no I mean it 's a that the point is is that awards have been asked to kind of look within their own wards as to whether these things that can be deferred within their own boards and and in what the priorities would be in the awards the idea of looking at what 's going on in terms of a central level that doesn 't wash that the museum issues we 're going to deal with there 's a 'm sure the museum Trust Board will be making submissions to us as well she statutes around the year from your we 're good at statutory obligations as far as the museum trust for go so we can 't we can 't just you know move money out of a budget that we 're statue early required to well without what it was very hard to find money because we 've got so that 's the point and maybe maybe it 's your wart that needs to be saying that we need more investment because our ward has been the most damaged and the earthquakes and our ward needs to have more money spent on it from the rating base across the city because it was more damaged so and I don 't think you should feel a shame of saying that that 's really important alright yeah ok you say that ok thank you as you know the counselors aren 't part of the submission yeah but he I 'm just a couple of two quite different questions I think rape was right before when he talked about a funding in you mentioned the cycleway money my understanding is that that cycleway would come into or come up into beresford street and so if there 's an issue over funding for orem avenue is that something we could look into it was that quite as separate it 's part of the master plan like this but the year it 's not for quite a few years room till about Soviet with a week at icici explain into the visibility event my other question is quite different over the South Shore stop banks there Tim so the understanding is obviously Sarah 's owned it read took away the houses that sought to actually facilitate budding and there was before now this confusion over whose land it is and Sarah 's in fact saying well it 's your land your responsibility is that your understanding correct I mean the people that the original owners actually maintained their Seawolves and it 's probably bit like having a breach and say Humphries drive you know there 's now a gap there in front of civil people 's houses and when I approached Sarah and that 's what I 've had all the time so it 's going back and forth meanwhile nothing 's been happening but I say I did have a bit of a breakthrough on friday i believe but I 'd like the council to kind of follow that up it is a real risk for people down there I mean we don 't need any more hassles and this can be fixed yeah I look I guess that I 've taken a particular interest and in the whole East and so I 've asked staff to brief me on on this whole issue and it 's it 's not an isolated issue and it may be that the solution isn 't a sea wall but it 's a band to the houses in terms of protecting the houses that are there at the moment so I think that there is a need for us Suffolk conversation but putting back what was there before when it collapsed and an earthquake event isn 't necessarily the best solution for the area but it does need a solution so I totally agree and back is no work we 're just saying we want some protection of some sort and in a bun da infect people in today 's story that might be several different ways of doing there are a number of people who are looking at this issue for you as we speak I 'm sure they 're working late oh yeah okay say I 'm Phil I 'm just on that s people following the self short like when we saw the work for example that your board had done on your Aranui local flood defence planning in the event of a disaster it 's really impressive it 's a really good model so I 'm just wondering is the knots co besides looking at protection like a balance and things in the event of an emergency particularly for for that plan to be extended to include self brighton well there is already plans in place i 'm on the new brighton safety partnership and we 've got plans to to look at using the era new model as a template for the greater new brighton area we made an attempt the year nobody 's got energy yet we just um we had no esteemed her to get it up and running with no funds and okay there are some staff who are involved with it andrea secrets you but it was Leah by the community resource everybody Utley amazing because of support for ahead notorian here i 'm pleased to get always volunteer time here bring out I don 't know it 's a really good model think I 'm sure that the Illinois community trust would be happy to lend some support your name my other question you brightened our networks greater than it ever has got a lot of its own in a lot of ways our community has become a lot more resilient yummy yeah absolutely quake thank you mother question read was about and it is the capital works you 're proposing is for that suburban master plan for New Brighton I 'm just wondering how you see the court future coordination of their Glynn alluded to this because this morning we had a deputy a submission from the New Brighton business association that there in was going to cost Council true but I just wondered how you crepes would see their proposal as it or as there another is there another way in fact that the coordination of the master plan can still help besides the phone so no I 'm not sure I follow the question I mean I denisha here the poor submission but I would assume that the there 's already the networks are already there in place to enable it happen what Alexis funding may well then it would greatly ok it 's Adam it 's a difference of a proposal thats all that 'll be done by an individual pixel indriya where I 'm coming from toe is that the my understanding was that each master plan had some staff associated with their plan to help developer at all and I 'm just wondering how in fact this proposal might fit alongside what has been the practice in some other areas too but the weekend of that discussion or you get a discussion later with what the counselors here all right Jimmy one question regarding to one of ACA need the electricity network you define space by us the strategic essay which it is which one it is we already have their own veggie we just have that question I mean I think that they were just examples yes yeah I think they saw not as we not as informed as you find a lower dosage yeah that 's fine yanny okay thank you I 'm just to trick question inside thank you for raising the footpath issue my understanding is that our maintenance levels of service have not changed so they haven 't been reduced I know you came I think last year and the year before and sort those three assurances what 's your understanding of the current maintenance levels of service there is an effective thing there 's almost nothing I still massive damage where you know curbs have been popped up you know set the fire up out of the out of the ground yeah so things like street cleaning so widespread so you can see a large area of parklands north beach and the west side of west beach yep so the normal maintenance isn i think it 's a bit yani I wouldn 't quite say that the footpaths are I was going to use a b-word dear but they are there their stuff and they need to be repaired or temporarily repaired there 's no point going a nun cleaning the the street if you can walk along I mean I 'm like I do clean the street this stuff that is I know you and they do clean the street in them so I 'm just trying to understand cuz we heard my priority as people can 't walk on the foot Alison that I was asking about the maintenance but the day-to-day maintenance that we feed previously isn 't being done and I 'm just checking with her it 's being done there are sweet there are streets around baker street and north you brighten that I I can 't guarantee but I 'm fairly sure they have their they 've got those old style Cole but the deep ones with the sort of them got the whole ones with driveway but yeah and I 'm sure a lot of those lot of liquefaction that down that street so there 's also a leading question so it 's also the issue that in some of the streets are an arm bar ever we 're culverts the bridges have actually they actually filled the whole thing in and she keeps a mental yeah there was nowhere for the morn a play in that play I just wanted to check on the apparition eglise pyramid water is we 've got a whole bunch of little squid as well but we 're kids applying and possibly a trustee of getting injured and it doesn 't appear to be any program to fix the lecherous will have you got areas of lateral speed as well that are like the footpaths that are nice mess of errors and and just filled with gravel or just lift lift completely as a pothole just hugely potholes curbs all also you have any program to fix those anymore there 's a place of living damage that hasn 't been a c-store dealt with the areas I 've been great nothing 's happened unto you whole cities crazy yeah a the playground budget which is around 3 mil so potentially we could bring that forward if we 're going to redevelop the poor lyrics that 's obviously where the playground is yeah there 's enough there 's another element to consider the air is that the new brighton Legacy Project mainland near or on that site so we want to be careful not to spend a whole lot of money developing it and then that 's what I 'm saying we would do the two things together at the same time yeah yeah you can still have your whale thingy okay and on the 2.2 the the land sale so the qe2 park is that reserves around yep yep okay because a few people brought this up I forgot to ask me questions so Pam mentioned it and I think Mike did there 's some issues around communities dealing with cells of reserve land and they both sort of said they were finding it difficult I think the art information yeah what the community boards asking for though is that with a sale could we bring fence the other the can be done and there is something that we should seek advice on yes yeah I mean that makes sense but but I wouldn 't get too excited about whether the Ministry of Education will proceed because the Ministry of Education might actually start looking for another site given some of the other things that are going on so there isn 't a guarantee that that the two schools will co-locate there they might look for another option so it did you know that the point is is that I mean will there 's been a publicity in the paper about the community wanting to have priority over the location of the pool I don 't know anything about it was just a bit of a media VW I 've done meeting with the 2 Bochy is next week of life yeah well the board chair was well one of them was quoted in the paper as sort of expressing some concern but so what I 'm saying is there if there is they haven 't actually applied to buy it yet so don 't beat the money until it appropriately that can be done so they can do that yes there 's a few of the vast about and I think it should be seasonally a priority of of the money thank you yep that 's really good all right okay thank you very much okay _"

    "text": "keyboard to come forward thank you bad marry counselors we appreciate the opportunity to speak to us be especially at such length that 's the first time I remember be able to do that for such a length of time so thank you very much I thought I start off with some general comments I mean you have our submission in front of you and the board has worked through the capital program in our ward with the community twice once in January and once recently and we think we have a very good understanding of where our community is at and what they see as the priorities and we have submitted by the list of priorities and a list for deferrals and the 0 power River the heathkit river is our number one priority in the ward I mean there 's lots of other more mundane things but that is the thing that we all agree is really important I won 't start with the financial strategy there is a lot to be said on this but I wanted to focus on one thing in particular is that large a look at the anchor projects that have just been have been delayed further and currently is estimated 450 million unspent from this annual plan and I don 't know what the numbers are today have a corner of a few millions considerable proportion of 1.2 billion and our Board believes that we should be scaling back the capital program and scale back the plans and that we should keep the assets and the loss of about 230 million dollars of dividends over the next decade will result in high rates and it just doesn 't make any sense to sell income earning assets to fund things which don 't earn income and it 's important to keep that divot in the stream because if there 's no point and selling it if we 're going to be compensated because who would buy it if we 're going to be adequately compensated for that dividend stream moving on to metropolitan opera tease for saving the board does believe that the central city library is a viable and excellent anchor project and we 'd like to support that but we also for it to work the board does oppose council contribution towards any council contribution towards the convention center whatever that may be understand it it 's math its money has been completed but the community is very very strongly against the convention center we 're opposed to any more spinning it has any convention center at all you don 't think Christchurch needs one or not no the community is against spending on a convention center when when the roads aren 't fixed yet yeah but we 've got nothing in our budget for it yep well that 's good to hear and but it 's important I think for us to communicate that the community is opposed to the computer center but I mean government wasn 't doing it then we 'd have to we 'd have to have a convention center we 'd have to put money on budget for a convention center I understand the position you 're in the community also opposed to more car parking and being funded opposed to a new stadium of any description at this point in time everybody says why on said that don 't think that accessible city faces two and three are a priority the board does support all urgent projects and the land drainage recovery program I think that all the urgent projects should proceed as planned but any non urgent projects should be delayed and with accessible City we notice 20 to 30 year plan and spending should be focused and at the tail end of that period rather than and the current long-term plan and the board opposes any cuts to community our grants to sorry to council grants to community organizations well you think that these grants are going towards the most vulnerable are now in our society we understand that the counselors discussed with that this is called business and it may not be cool business according to a strict it was our sake the two percent cuts were a mistake made after we saw the activity management plan we 've already said that at the beginning of the session today I 'm absolutely sure you 're right made a mere but there has been an attrition over the years in real terms anyway we have asked for an increase in past submissions to the council that over a period of ten years restoration to the previous budget that was held and mock 2004 2006 2000 sighs yeah and it bounced two in their current community grant scheme amounts to what something like zero point zero four percent of the top it was a mistake you 're 18 was saying is it after the budget this year but understand I 'm very pleased that the council was in favor of retaining what is but we 're reviewing it after the event as we said we 're looking for a more resilience focused approach to funding community organizations so it 's not just an annual grant process that 's why we 've shifted some people to longer-term ones and we 've got better reporting requirements reducing the reporting requirements so that we can make it easier for community organizations but that that 's what we 've done so far but we 've still got this review that we 're undertaking moving on to our priorities for our ward and so that 's probably Paul is priority as something that our borders very focused on and we would like to see the poor cousin of the a the same attention that the islands having into the into the future and things like flood defence cleaning up the river so as it goes into the river a whole lot of things like that so our community is very focused on that with a group working towards it and also to maybe relook at the med Heath get master plan as well get there and focus in our top 10 less we also included grain street and you 'll remember miss Dell fell that last year when we were here on the annual plan that you said you would make special note of green street they were due for the street to be refurbished starting the month after the earthquake struck they had waited ten years they were incredibly generous they came to the board and under said that they understood why Green Street wouldn 't go ahead but we wish to keep faith with them and we have included in our list of priorities we also are on our priority list as well this was pulled down accidentally or not immediately after the earthquakes without the knowledge of the guardians of the pseudonym heritage church who had spent 750,000 on that for strengthening prior to the earthquake it now sits as a pile of rubbish at the entrance to sudden them depressing all those who pass by and all those who see it we wish that rubble to be analyzed immediately for asbestos and to see if it has goddess bestest and an either way for the rubble to be removed either in order to build a significant entrance to send them to remind people of that which stood before all for it to be carted away for good but we wish the problem of signum church to be and treated as an urgent issue the other issue is locarno Street lucano Street has a pumping station which has never caused them any problem we have residents that have lived on locarno street for 40 years said that the pump station has never caused a smell in the street it is now an overwhelming smell especially on live with it they probably can 't sell their houses while it exists there it is the the back end of March school is there so as a tennis club and the pump station is not being able to handle their developments in the green belt and in the brown developments west of the city which is now going through the pump station which it was never built to handle it is a safety issue the residents are talking about going to the Ministry of Health we would like that addressed urgently as well and finally the 0 power Public Library has been sitting on power street waiting waiting waiting and we would like to see it addressed to see if it should be saved we would like to see it saved and if not for the council to start planning for a new volunteer library for our power finally I 'd like to say because Paul 's going to address the other ward projects for prioritization I 'd like to say that I was one member of the board who consulted on the LTP at sint maarten hoon hay places Barrington illness it sales and 20 person the majority view of people that we consulted was opposed to asset sales they believed that the council has an obligation to our ancestors to retain the assets that were built and bought for at some cost by the people that went before and now just finishing off our presentation the just to talk about deferral our issue the first item for deferral as lincoln road widening okay yeah when I came on the board Lincoln Road was being was planned that lincoln road would be widened and i said then and this was eight years ago and i say now that that would be a lying in front of the bulldozer instance for me the widening of lincoln road would destroy yet another suburb in the inner city of christchurch because other people have moved outside of christ you too wish to get to work fast the widening of lincoln road would probably take 10 seconds off the treble from whiteley to pay hagley park for people traversing that area an enormous cost we think will be the equivalent of the opposed to the widening of lincoln road so secondly the board believes that it would be prudent to delay and it repairs to the South library service center now this isn 't because we don 't fail you it 's precisely the offices because it is our most valuable community asset probably it is it is loved and when it closed after the earthquakes people will really upset it 's going to take about eight months to fix if it 's a repair and probably about the same if it 's a rebuild what we would like to do is see if as long as it 's not going to make it more expensive over long run that it be delayed next the board I none of the board members understand why the buyer and gets an intersection is it has been put down as a priority and when we have asked for answers the only response was that its future proofing the transport network now I don 't think now is really the time for future proofing now is the time for getting rid of things that we don board would like that deferred significantly the board has also sought information and I think the mere for ensuring that the board was able to ask whole bunch of questions of senior staff unfortunately they weren 't able to answer any of our questions and haven 't_''_777.84 got back to us with information about these two items and so we don 't know whether these are needed or not but the safety fences on diet pass road and the Pioneer leisure center again if these are really needed then sure let 's have them but if they 're not defer them the board also supports the deferral of improvements to 441 Colombo street there is already green space nearby it 's great that is it strategic purpose which one hurts and contribute to the Signum master plan but it is it 's certainly not needed at the moment it 's there we can work on it later let 's defer it now the Victoria Park driveway is in better condition then I would say the majority of the roads north of limb whatev and to the east of the river unless it 's going to come at tremendous cost and you know it is one driveway a park next the the board has not seen a concept plan for chlorination reserve and haven 't_''_846.09 been adding any information about it and we don 't see it as a priority has no it 's not like anybody has contacted us saying that it 's urgent and we don 't believers urgent so that should be deferred and finally the eddington water tower as in the Heritage rebuilt ranch too but it doesn 't seem to be urgent unless it 's a safety issue that can be deferred even you know people in Eddington who are familiar with it don 't believe that it should be a priority when we consider all the pressing needs and that really concludes our presentation so I 'm happy to take questions avoid illness yep visible before I take questions I just want to understand what the issue is with the sudden I 'm heritage church site so I don 't have everything on it it was pulled as you know it was pulled down it to get to the bottom of that but it became rubble almost immediately after the earthquake without an understanding I know the site well and I know they are the minister hey and you know it or no and the the people the volunteers who are in the trust that manages the church have for a very long time repeatedly tried in very many ways like for instance at one stage we were investigating accessing a container to move the rubble to a safe place where it could be sorted because there 's a belief that the pews and the ultra and other precious things are still lie underneath the rubble that and and they hadn 't even been able to find out of this tool there or what condition they 're in and now that they they are saying that there 's s bestows at this asbestos on the rubble but there is a belief amongst the trustees that that surface asbestos carried there by the wind and the passing traffic on brown street and that it doesn that underneath the top layer and they had it tested underneath that the majority of the rubble could still be saved to build a memorial to the two to end an entrance way to signal at the moment it 's almost despaired as the cathedral in the square ripped small in terms of blocking anybody 's view of a synonym that can be progressive and can change for the future but I 'm whose legal responsibility as a ah yeah I was just going to say that if they were to remove the rubber without any asbestos there or was that I think she said it was about three hundred thousand dollars whereas with the asbestos the cost a song I 've order hundred thousand dollars will be about with the asbestos the year it was between half heart in a million dollars so that the problem is is that the surface asbestos is potentially increasing the cost of it and making it unaffordable plus the the money from the insurance as being held back by the council so that the trust itself can 't move forward so why is the council holding the money back it 's insurance money and were told to produce a business plan to give to whoever and they haven 't done that yet but we don 't really know and they they didn 't go forward with the business plan because of the issue of its be stopped because I don 't know what I mean they don 't know whether you 're asking for money to go on the ratepayers generally for this one site so I mean I think probably what we need to do is get a report on the details of it to see what can be progressed and we 've moved a resolution at the board asking for further finite testing of 4s best odds yep determine one of the issues have reported up at the borders has been to teased one as this was based on the surface a bit head of spinsters the other that 's really important to note that the second test was taken 30 centimeters own at the points that the original tests were made their shoulders none so at the board meeting that what we need is an essential move forward is to test made arrangements and they were made years ago to put the rock the halls of stone which is now very variable and all those bits and pieces we have arranged inhibit had a long-standing arrangement with the council land at the sudden other bignum pump station to store it all and salt it while they look at what to do on the land so the number once it will be great if we can get a hurry long for council staff to somehow work out how to do a third and totally conclusive test on the site because as Melanie said the difference between a hundred and fifty thousand each can be covered by the amount of the insurance hairs between five and seven hundred thousand but as an ebb salute million yeah I get home so that 's good okay we 'll get an update on that so any time you you One X again just to Christians under 12 100 page 115 metropolitan is to savings air projects d point two more army you don 't you the community water against more car parking elderly disabled campaign as of the gas to retail but what are specifically talking with regards to the car parking well when you consider that the lack of funds businesses be providing their own car packing and when do we move to be a Wellington kind of city we where the chicken and the egg results and us using public transport how do we do that if we constantly build the reason for cars to exist we have to at some stage say or bite the bullet and say if you want to go into town you do what they do in Wellington you 'd go on public transport if you lil for cashing it cars yummy so a relevant of any deals or whatever that could be done or just straight out counsel from and your total against car parking increase for putting we 're not totally against car park and we just say it shouldn 't be one of our priorities and it should be business want cars to park they should be providing it thank you that the last one is I 'm seventeen point 12 deferrals with regards to the on cost would also be we asked for a report on its safety as well so I just want to clarify that 's right if it 's if it 's not safe or then of course focus it will if it 's not so people will have to get out I mean that that 's yes so we write when we ask that well we 're out there 20 minutes but I mindful of the fact that I interrupt a couple I 'm so full with in alley so it mines really you 'll find that the board of clarification for example the priority of the Apollo he 's got River and like there 's reference there to some specific um I guess pollution issues around the pollution issues when the Kashmir stream drainage recovery type issues that do you think the recent the bus tour we had the other day did it highlight any issues around drainage so the weather heathkit river is an hour would that in fact projects need to be done need to be fixed I raised that because submission from hagley fearing we 'd had are some does some plan that you know of any plans or asking for any plans would like to for some specific design on projects on the a beneath go oh not not so much specific specific design but it 's that I mean the Kashmir stream is is a number one tributary and as a major source of soap how long did you want to add anything the point we haven 't been given any proposed projects for the area but yes as call joe said the kashmir stream that feeds into the heath could river and you can stand by the confluence of the heath good river and the kashmir stream and you see the difference you see the sediment and it flows into the screen so that 's one of the areas that were concerned about and we have talked to ethan as a keyboard about you know possible plantings and other you know projects but as of yet we haven 't heard anything ok and it seems to me that actually relatively little money is actually set aside for the heath kitchen general and that not what my impression the same though money funding at for Len drainage recovery and that 's why really wanting to experience a agree with ya we are holding she just after we are holding a seminar specifically for that reason involving all three of the wards involved with the history which will look at drainage storm water flooding in the environment so that each group who have got something to do hiscott can understand what the others are doing and can comply with the mid his cat linear plan great and we 'd like to come thank you yeah so I mean I have a question that I want to ask around lean drainage as well because of your request to take auditor fear items and the program because I want to get your take on the on the infrastructure strategy but and no jaani was going to ask a question yeah thank you um I do appreciate that you your grace lee contingent center which probably is costing us about 100 million if you take the loss of car parking the old library site in gloucester street but they 80 million oh please don 't tell that community board but just in terms of a question over the the Signum church like Shirley in certain occupational safety and health issue asbestos has come from somewhere and laid it on top and there 's people walking past it yeah look I don 't need to do this but we 've already agreed that we 're going to get a full report but I just in terms of understanding like the immediate risk have you had any advice counselors liability or or anything like that in terms of immediate action required no we 've had very little information and that 's why we need a report yeah i mean i think if we could get some of it counts on thursday cuz i 'm really concerned I mean this is young yannis there are two separate processes happening could you just allow all this was raised at a council meeting yeah please now I want to ask about this because you 've raised the fact that that you don 't believe that 440 million dollars of spending on the land drainage infrastructure strategy highlights that that 's at the lowest end of that was the lower end of the range and potentially 1.2 billion dollars for land drainage our committee has sunk as a result of the earthquakes we now have the threat of sea level rise and coastal erosion in a more extreme form than it was before the flood risks already seen the natural hazard maps that are out there on the first stage of the natural hazards chapter for the district plan review how on earth do we take money off the minimal end of a budget and then say that we shouldn 't be looking at a new way of delivering a program that needs to be delivered over maybe a 20 or 30 year period with with more spent at the in the first ten years then what has already indicated on the plan well I guess the point is officially we don 't have the money but also we don 't have there 's not the capacity in the market like if if you can remember after the first earthquake we had a combined meeting got out an engineer got up and said look we don 't have enough pipes the piping we don 't have the workers we don 't have the machines you can 't hope I mean I 'm not disagreeing it wasn 't for the land drainage recovery program that was specifically in relation to the government 's announcement that they were going to do perimeter treatment around particular areas of the city that were now vulnerable to lateral spread and liquefaction so so that was a completely separate issue I don 't_''_1612.5 I personally think that if we don 't get the land drainage recovery program right we are not going to be able to clean up the heath care or that even we 're not going to be able to actually introduce some opportunities around wetlands we I mean we have got this incredible opportunity to get our city right and to make it resilient to future events by actually using for example the residential red zone land in a way that it would not have been possible if the houses have been me fair so when we know then instead of going or we might need to spend this money because there 's very little precision in the land drainage recovery program and I mean before but to me it just looks like it it 's not a wish list it 's a we might have to spend this amount of money we might have to spend 1.2 billion point that i met this let 's cross that bridge when we come to it we 're not at the bridge yet all right okay thanks very much _"

    "text": "this from Shirley pocket i might davidson thank you a good evening i 'm pretty open myself up a bit so it talked too long on the whole submission leave but more time for answers questions answers there 's probably a few key areas in our submission that I wanted to talk on the first one is the st. Albans community center permanent community center currently there 's a transitional one on site and there is funding in the budget for a new transitional Center and which we completely support what we do is that it is push forward a year the transitional facility least currently expires 2016 and we just want to get things moving to make sure if that lease is terminated at that point of not renewed that we do have something can in place yep next up is probably our biggest project in our ward which is the cranford Street for Layton and Northern aterial extension currently as the project stands the board cannot support it we have major concerns about the bottleneck that 's going to be created at the inners road in cranford Street in from obviously North Canterbury and they used to mate roughly forty seven thousand vehicles through that intersection per day and obviously if going from four lanes down to two lanes Azaz it 's not going to work in our view so there 's that project for those two projects it 's 60 in excess of 67 million dollars being spent on that with less than a million dollars been spent on downstream effects downstream effects which we just don 't think adds adds up is going to cause bigger problems than what we currently currently have there but we acknowledge there is support from the outer suburbs in our ward because it is going to be traffic congestion easement those in those areas at the same time we 've got suburbs closer to the city that are going to have a huge negative effect from what 's going to happen from this project what we believe needs to happen is the the downstream effect from this project needs to become a major project itself and work in tandem and built at the same time as the crevice Street four-laning very good one wave systems that connect almost to the warrenton Street which we believe which service these this area quite well if it could get linked on properly so there 's an opportunity there to make it work currently we think the whole of the north canterbury and north of christchurch coming into our city is basically going down a four-lane street that ends just that nothing really and it 's just going to be huge problems for the city moving moving forward I think we really need to look for the future and not at the current situation and I understand we hear from staff that they don 't know what 's going to happen in the future I think we need to be a little bit more realistic and realized that the town will be rebuilt and people are going to go into the town so we need to make sure we put a foot creek now and not make mistake affair there 's a couple of projects that and on the funding have driven the lastly one is the pretty fence of the sticks mill reserve having half a fence or even think it 's quite important project actually be added to it to make sure that is completed also one that saw needs to be done with the why met district council is a walk cycle bridge over the y mech river and we think this is quite an important project it needs to be restarted and looked at my understanding is they had a name for it way back when it was first done which is the Norman Cook talk away but we fully support that beam or back into place they 're probably the main points is obviously a lot of other things in that submission so I 'm welcome to take questions I 'm full thanks Mike I 'm just on the cranford street and northern motorway from what from your comments is it like that if in fact there could be like a workable plan for the section downstream from anas road that in fact your board would be more likely to support the whole northern motorway it 's we 're getting this big we 've got a big Ward so negative effects into the day I guess the government 's are pushing to where the extension has to be gun so pissed up again so we 're sort of getting pushed into one direction but we believe we need to basically mitigate some of those negative effects you know there 's going to be negative effects from this motorway that we 're not going to be able to control you know there 's a community that is going to be very neatly affected from this project but we need to do our best to obviously reduce those problems from from there so one of those things is looking at how we can actually get the traffic flowing through there quicker so some of the negative effects of obviously having their suburb cut in half will be reduced by the fact that the congestion won 't be as bad and just to clarify my understood you were saying that in fact in terms of resolving the congestion issue especially for the northern parts of your ward that in fact the board would be support our support of finding a way to to exhibit yep Apple mine was along similar lines issue it just how i said before i 'm hearing is correct that the ins OTAs desire to get the waimakariri residents into the city where they come each day through this state highway is now going to be dumped on the council at a point where we have to take some ownership of it and we don 't know what that is going to look like that 's the script so the Bacara jews in that motorway will be from the wimax oh yes there 's a positive effect because they 're not going down through some of the northern suburbs like Belfast and redwood but the people in Belfast and ribbit won 't be using that motorway they 'll be going down the main north rope Avenue arrow which about have as much congestion so that people use in that mode away that we were going to page 67 million dollars for will be non paying right pass from the web yep Oh Allie what start saying at the moment will happen once calcetin us rose like they believe and they don 't think there 'll be much Rep running and the daily traffic at the intersection of be liev and sherbourne will be about 11,000 which you know we 're not engineers but just doesn 't seem to add up to us yep there are other issues that people would like to raise I hope to let your get off scot-free so the Shirley community center just we 've got that on on the budget at the moment and but you 're you want that brought forward st. Albans a sin Albans I 'm sorry I sequel there 's the Shirley one as well I 'm Stafford currently in discussion we had a community meeting house muttering so that is moving I see called the wrong number so this is 2 11 31 yes and you want it brought forward by a year yes okay right I too was undressed in this whole cranford Street business because the proposal at the stage is to for lane to anas road but then it is to allow it to be double laned going in in the morning in doubled end talk about clear way so there is I think just under a million dollars for their downstream effect of it we don 't exactly know the exact how they 're going to do that but that is a proposal but we still don 't see there would be a proper solution to that so so have you talked about what the solution is they always abhorred we believe for Lena all the way around to Madras and Barbados and enjoying it on to their incur extending a one-way system right up to warrenton to the end of it and then we have to contour there so come down addressing the bailiffs I 'm just trying to figure out where would you tune leave so but so cranford streams they 've got all the web to shoe ball when it gets to do it then hang a lift around there and their links up to the address of about us yeah so for on genesis isn 't that the original route that various people got elected to council opposing possibly could be right it 's cut be ready hey right okay that 's a project that would satisfy their oh it 's not going to satisfy a lot of people because half the problem is the intruders heavy nick suburb cut in half yeah but we 're trying to look at the best way to I guess made the best possible outcome out of a poor situation yet we can 't please everyone by the same time I don 't want you know we have people were saying oh there 's a big win for the people of the north but I don 't think we should be given people a big one at the cost of other people in our in our ward but it 's trying to look at the best solution we 've sort of sort of been forced on us I guess it is hugely challenging but the thing that I 've never understood is why you would choose the street that ends at Bailey Avenue yeah I mean it doesn 't you 've got to go left or right and I can 't understand why you would do that but anyway yani thank you it 's have you thought about given the huge amount of money we 're spinning and flopped and to deal with the flooding and then we get a just a block over or two blocks over going to spend a whole watch more money on roading has anyone looked at those two issues together and found out if there 's any common solutions because it seems the more sensible cost-effective wire dealing with the issue there has been discussed it was brought up by le but i think the the way their northern material hits Queen Elizabeth to drive it doesn 't work get across that think there was the and it doesn 't actually cross things it 's just a year the way that had to dialing it would make it not work so this was the best solution if they continue straight forward but it has been looked into yeah Pauline so are you end your board suggesting bit nothing be done until that power is sorted out and it 's encapsulated and one project rather than at the moment it 's 23 bits with a bit missing since let projects that currently stand is in one big projects you 've got the northern atira which is the NZTA you got the extension which is acid also the creme fraiche street four-laning we think that project should actually be four parts to it all done it so same time so that would include the downstream effects are basically everything is done at the same time because we think if the cranford street for lane is done first it 's just going to be it won 't won 't work what your communities worried about is that without the fourth stage you fear that it will never get on the budget and you and they 'll be left with this yeah Nick it 's sort of like like a cheer for leagues you know you can do saying with three legs it 's not a problem but since you put weight on it it 's just going to crumble or dip it it depends where you put the league some stall a three-legged stool can be very stable you know when it goes in that for food but anyway le spectre aired what 's the number of vehicles that should be having that NS Road intersection until it narrows essentially what 's once it 's all done here so this is a between 31 figures the only figure I 'd know there is for that intersection our daily there 's 47,000 so currently it sits at around 20,000 to even put it obviously lanes in this store not going to get to what it means the difference between the 47 odd and I 'm not playing games really care for me for the figures but so when you get to the air and you 've got 47 and you 've got to livin at the end of sherborne your point before about not adding up as where are the rest of those cars going yeah yeah it 's a good question and we still went for the answer and I believe we 've got some modeling coming it 's a lot of house we went for the answer and of it obviously you 've had a discussion at your community board about the level of rates and creases and you 'd to see such an increase and we prefer that a capital was not as much capable of spent and we also had a discussion around asset sales as well which is in there now but you 've now asked us to increase the capital expenditure so we 're about where you 're going to suggest that we reduce the capital expenditure hogya well they said there 's a big question so you guys are all the brains on that one we have asked a couple of things to be deferred us as well possibly then we might need to look at the whole 67 million dollar normative extension and crevice to explore laning well is a lot of money exactly well it is a lot of money but we have a commitment in terms of the central government oh the wrongs yeah the target haven 't told agents and all burns I think we 've got some obligation due to to do something about the congestion Trevor condition that part of the city doesn 't when you put a bond projects I know we 've had a number of issues cycle bridge over the waimakariri River I 'm a net again that 's another huge budget you may be suggesting that it be a joint project between CCC and why my career District Council but I 've yet to see a joint project between the two councils that there 's equally funded if we do it on a population basis then I suspect we 're also talking about a large capital capital proposal there as well but anyway look thank you very much that 's very good and I 'm glad that our community boards are thinking about all of the issues that 's great thank you and the next one is the spray tan head cut community board _"

    "text": "and now we 've already done hoodie fairy made so now we move on to Rickerson would groan community board my aura greetings deleting it gives me great pleasure to sit here today and presenter community board submission I won 't go through the first couple of sentences but to congratulate the capsule on the extents of engagement process that you 've undertaken so far well done under the greater christchurch urban development strategy and this southwest area plan it 's acknowledged the rickett and Wigram ward is one of the leading growth areas in the city and will remain so for the next two decades additionally the board notes that the intent in framework of both the land the loop and the proposed replacement district plan reflect the clear emphasis on intensification in the post earthquake environment a specific example of the major shift in land-use intensification which is a major concern to the board are the adverse effects on on local communities that arise from the expansion of quarrying activity on the periphery of the urban areas in this regard the board cannot stress enough the importance of budget the capacity and resources allocated so that a high standard of monitoring and compliance of associated convened conditions are in place and being capable capable of maintained that what we 're saying here is the resource consents it granted conditions need to be monitored and enforced and that 's where we 're having and have it and quite a lot of issues over the years we don 't want that to continue into the future with such rapid the rapid development and growth happening now and the project then projected to occur in the ward the board is especially keen to ensure that this plan will contribute to managing the challenges opportunities and expectations of the Riccarton Wigram community for the next 10 years local capable projects given the council 's present financial pressures the board notes the extent of the proposed capital program the attention being given to the riffat and Wigram board to local to the road networks road safety improvements I just pause there for a month we were concerned to see quite a number of identified raid safety improvements that have been deferred or dropped area as well so that and dropped off the list I mean unbudgeted I think when something 's been budgeted and it 's to do with safety it needs to be strictly you know had a very very close look at cycleways is another thing that we 're very very keen to see progress in our ward but it just take the opportunity to mention that the cars road over bridge over the motorway is is in the budget process but it 's been put out but what has been identified since this document was written that there is a plan to put the O wacker trail down that same am cows Road cycleway bridge which is not the location of the wrecker Heritage Trail heritage trail goes down a wacker Road not cars rates I 'm just flagging that at the stage so that if there 's budget to to to put the ax wecker trail in a different location and from what I 'm understanding it it requires purchasing 20 meters of five different properties down cars road to give it the width the combined width of the is going to be 40 meters which is quite a big hunk of land particularly when it 's in the wrong place i 'm just flagging that i 've just just caught up with that fact and madam mayor and councillors but we do I appreciate and support the just three local projects the hornby librarian service center Southwest leisure centre and the halls will skate park I heard from a presentation earlier and from another community board about the lack of aquatic facilities we lost their run err sup in pool quite a long time ago the only pool that we do have in our ward covered pool public covered pull this foreign oohing which is earmarked for closure what 's the new metropolitan one but I 'll get on to that shortly through our submission as well but we 're very very passionate about retaining that so the board is pleased to note that the foot and the next one that refers to the funding and or the relocation of the cars wizard car cut or the Christchurch car club go kart club I realized that that was week by the council and the budget for that locate relocation was some is quite prohibitive now I met with the arbor tia residents association representatives this morning they will be they will be presenting on Friday and because the go-carts and the present location is holding up residential development in the area it 's been suggested that it refers back to the original plan change five the arbor tears plan change which gives a a commercial business zone buffer around the go carts so that they can stay where they are which is a bit unfortunate but I think that 's the best solution so and the RTO Residents Association will be talking about that the next one num met him mount mayor and councillors of bread short air this is the only one section of road that we that we refer to it 's got quite a history with it there if you read through a submission it was jus to to be upgraded in 2010 but since then we 've had deputations to our board and on-site meetings with them with people in the area there are this area plus the urban channel is the old district urban channel other sections of the street further down have been upgraded it 's the only one in that area so what we 're asking for us is for that to be to be budgeted for and upgraded because it is more than just the strip the look of the street there are quite serious drainage and storm water issues and sewage overflow issues the templeton community 3.3 they claim that they have forgotten community and that when they look at budgets around the city anyway it 's a very very lovely community but they have had and I 've been involved with that resident sociation for over 20 years they have had ongoing issues with flooding in the creek road area there was a new storm water retention system put in place a few years ago and rail railway Terrace that we thought was going to be solve all the problems and it hasn 't so what we are or what they are asking for is for those historic flooding issues around the crowd area to be addressed and and Templeton as well currently the bus and the main bus stops on road is outside the chemists and doctors when it 's raining your step out you can 't see aside the oldest urban channel and it 's flooded so you step out you don 't know where the drainers whether we 're the footpath starts and the rain finishes quite dangerous just seems to be in the worst possible location so what we 're asking for is can we please get something done about there then we go on to the nuke urban channel and footpaths and aquatic outstanding issues with the lack of in our ward as well Dunbar 's road on the north side from Wigram road to halls will raid when you go down there it 's got a lovely curb and channel on the south side nothing at all on the north side of Dunbar 's road there 's no delineation at all between that so the road edge is all breaking away this potholes is great big muddy sludge pots that people have got to walk through to get the bus stops that pleading for is some money to be put in the urban urban channel renewal programs for that area in particular the main south road new footpath from Carmen Road the chappie place very very high frequency area pedestrian wise no footpath and that 's that road means that section a main south road until just over a year ago was NZTA it is now the City Council the road so we need to pick up some responsibility for their the other thing that amiran councillors is there 's no curb cut down there 's nowhere for people to stand while awaiting for the bus they 've got to move down that north side of there and we 're encouraging people there is bus lanes down record down Main South Road down that section of range both bus priority lanes but there 's no footpath to people to walk across there 's no curb cut downs for anybody with mobility issues to actually get up onto the off the main off the main south road and up onto the slippery grass so that 's um that 's an issue that we also talked about we talked to NZTA about getting some pedestrian crossing facilities on the on the north side of the common road main South Road intersection as well so people can walk from the mall down to count down and then vice versa if we want to encourage physical transport rather than motor vehicles that 's the way to do it and also at this is another historic one halls were road we 've been told from Dunbar 's 28 and field drive we 've been told that you know that there is a policy that they won 't put footpaths down roads with us know until it 's been developed all that section has been developed a lot of it is drain it swells but the developments taking place at the back of that people have got no footpath down that East section or the west section at all if halls were right so you get people coming out of aid in the field one to walk and they 've got no footpath to walk them 3.5 is a University of Canterbury come as you know that 's in and out of that university every year the equivalent of the population of expert there what we 're I 'm suggesting here is that we do we look at in conjunction with the University and residents sociation as a master plan similar to the suburban master plan where there 's am a sensible buffer between the commercial because university is the commercial business and the and the residential interface been some huge issues over the years with converting them houses for example 22 accommodation and five six bedrooms rooms for rent so it 's just that if if there can be some money made available please to help with the pro you know with the post-trade risk of a master plan around the university that would be rear very much appreciated and we offer fulsome more support to the to the wicket and community center and service center and voluntary library I 'm reestablishment or renewal that we are disappointed and I go back to the foreign II pool again the board is disappointed however to understand that the future of foreign of a pool and Recreation Center is don 't see a great need at all to put the death now on foreign or pool or the recreation center with the opening of a metropolitan sports facility so what we 're saying is that 's a historic thing it 's a STM it 's the coronation pool that pool was built for the coronation of the Queen as a memorial and it 's getting a lot of use by the swimming club and the public session so all we 're asking for us please don 't give it the chop funding alternatives this may or may not done for to positively on some people 's ideas but these are the things that them that we offer some ideas for the council to contemplate in future budgets considerations and that is GST the tax on rates that these taxes be returned to the council to contribute towards the council 's recovery with the proviso there to be for a defined period we know that there 's no point raising that as a recommendation for us to consider in the LTP well can 't_''_936.23 we have a working party that to have raised it year after year after year that 's in the local government funding review and we will continue to support it but there 's no point raising it here we 'd like to have ideas that we can actually advance now okay our board wanted to raise a tier so we get regional fuel Texas the submission sees all of us you know you don 't yeah you don 't know what focus I go does that mean Apple endowment fund yes we 've asked for a report on whether we need to continue with the capital and down at third due to the circumstances and what that would do yep okay there 's a rating level some and the impact of the combined um rates increases over a period here it 's just a young it 's something that you 've probably read and understand but the impact is over the next three years of twenty five percent increase in rates and we do acknowledge the difficult position financially and the board would ask the council to continue to do all it can to limit the it 's very very difficult Regina did you discuss like the last community board the idea of a slightly higher rate and grease so that there 's no need to look at me know wherever you 'd like a lower right yeah but this submission via doc document was endorsed by the community board yeah but but that 's by the by it doesn 't matter you know that the council laws as a general rule but didn 't didn 't take absolutely correct yeah so and the strengthening communities funds we 've had some clarification on that today Madame mayor and councillors much appreciate the fact that that hasn 't been reduced very very very much appreciate that fact and seven is the the comments that we 've done in previous years the community Bulls you know as far as governance framework and and and we accept that and we look forward to they 're getting more delegations and responsibilities and resourcing prayer boards to continue to advocate and then and do good work for our community and to take some of the work load off the very very give us that respond sibility we are thank you very much thank you okay there 's a couple of minutes left David on page three of your support Emily hitting disposal of council essence you write the statement that you 're opposed to any disposable cats at council assets to fund the any matters related to the earthquake do I take at the end if we 're looking at some new initiatives and developments you 'd be amenable to accessing capital to do those fundamentally we don 't really want to sell assets but to look at other ways of funding one of those other ways of funding and a are mentioned in there are other alternatives ie regional fuel taxes targeted race there is no power to introduce a regional fuel text there isn 't one an Auckland they asked for once and the government took away the ability when when the previous Labour government was important they put on a regional fuel text national repealed it so don 't even go there okay it 's worth a go you 're asking for alternatives metameric gotta be alternatives that 's being made is that if we 're not going to release any capital I mean and and the Regional Council area of tirana they released forty-four percent of their shareholding they now earn more than they earned by way of dividends then they earned at the time the sheer value went from a dollar five to sixteen ninety five or something you know it 's a massive increase in value to the region owning forty-four percent of a successful asset instead of a hundred percent of one that was a basket case I 've got a feeling meta mirren council laws that if the if that question was put to our community board about selling some shares in some assets that that could well be gained support but I haven 't got that support at this time all I 'm saying that I I suspect because we have chatted about these things but a ploy asset sales but selling shares and some non-strategic assets could be well worth looking at yeah that the thing is is that if it 's not got any strategic values then you can 't any value that would return to the county so i think i think that the point that you made then is that this seems to be a debate around asset sales versus not selling assets when in fact what we 've said is that there 's a range of things that we need to understand the value of before we write something off and you 're saying your community board is open for that conversation I would say so I mean without having a definite art so I would say that they would probably warm towards the ability to sell off some shares in some assets rather than wholesale sale of it and certainly get a bigger return if that 's the case so but anyway thank you very much your time is concluded after time as well I think I know it 's just a procedural there 's a number of projects that you identified that we don 't have in front of us can we get a copy of that project list tennis him we can we try every single thing that might just read out has come 't feel it was a year bro he was a secret submissions the original submission and was replaced and i 'm telling you everything that might just read out as and the replacement submission it 's only electronic copies and there was a couple of things meta me that i did touch on the wind that weird in there and one of the most am the funding for the cycle overpass over the main set over the sub nathia remote away well okay I I dragged at and under under run cycleways the reference the cycleways I put your cutter and to the new Kevin counsel anyway look and the local camping procreative the extra to the staff have recorded everything it will be picked up it will be reported back on awesome thank you right so the next submission _"

    "text": "see that paula has arrived would you like to come forward or thank you my apologies collect lateness that 's right yeah Adrian 's gonna go first I have no idea what he 's going to say Thank You Think You counselors in fellow liquid members in staff at two academy at the Capitol you mein aana I ain 't no neither did I not at all I just want to ignore things first of all the authenticity of this particular fan of submissions as opposed to previous processors have happened and also we just very much aware that you know we are the smallest of all the rated wards and announcer particularly like the UH Korea the like pens runner quite pimentel eccentric so just handed over to you okay right thank you and first a little administrative matter we 've had we 've had a late submission from the cafe reserves management committee which was only formed finalized in the last week or so and have must they they 've missed the deadline for the long term plan and I 'm wanting to ask whether you would consider I bring up that it 's fine so they 're called the kiss Bay right okay that 's fine thank you probably an operational matter okay at I nice good yes so thank you for doing that I 'm not going to go on and on but there 's just three things I want to highlight one as the levels and wastewater project which was the capital project 890 that would be our top priority and we have that goes ahead as planned and we 've attached to our submission a timeline with you we will hope will explain all the reasons why it kind of needs to happen there was incredibly helpful thank you you really helped okay I 'm pretty cool it seems like that 's going to happen but I just need to make sure that no you do you see that we 're going through every single yeah that 's project so and the only only other two things I want to talk about the naval point area which is a which has been an eyesore and a an embarrassment for our community and I think since that marina was destroyed yep and we welcome project the capital project 357 the littleton marina and byron 's development this is fantastic and it 's incorporated also it 's referred to in the draft littleton port recovery plan it 's part of that whole thing but we we 're a bit worried that there while there 's funding for the development plan that doesn 't appear to be from our reading any funding to actually implement the development plan and we 're very uneasy about that we don 't want development plans being prepared and there 's a good process going on with lots of involvement with the community groups expectations raised and then nothing happens again for another 10 years that would be awful and there 's another couple of other naval point projects which we 're not quite we 've asked for some explanation about how they fit in with that development plan project one of the ones that the community borders championed as project 17 9 18 which is currently unfunded which seeks to make some modifications on the seaward side to make to improve weather to in speed at naval point and it would be our view that that project should probably be considered along with the development plan not as a separate item so and there 's a couple of other naval point things that would be good we just would like some confidence that there 's an integrated planning process going on not not things being lived out and the final thing is there 's a number of you did you make a submission on the little turn recovery plan as well oh yes yeah yeah I thought you would have but I just I 'm just assuming that you do so he did I thought a better ask and then it 's so so the thing that I wanted relevantly as Norwich key we 've got a number of unfunded projects that address this thing that leveraging community has been asking for for years and led us to get that heavy traffic off what is original main street we are optimistic that that may even happen yet as a result of that recovery plan process so we are very pleased to moment just sitting there may be ready to pop out of either that becomes possible so thank you thank you we 're happy to take some questions yep ref is it yep thanks guys for coming in sounds like you need a bit of money to invest in some of these projects what confuses me though is around side the port and assets is that there 's a reluctance to raise the capital that we actually need to invest in things so you can 't have it both ways and I 'm just interested to know how you think we 're going to get the capital that you need to make the investments that we want to happen in your community we talked about this at the community board when we had our submissions committee there was general support for not selling assets but we couldn 't kind of get agreement about what the alternative was there was a range of use because also there 's something else that worries me it says if the poor company is sold it will put future revenue from the company into private hands what people don 't realize is the capital that you get from that sale is the present value of those future cash flows so there 's this idea that when you sell something you give something up you 're not you 're actually getting the cash today the value of that cash has worked out on the present value of those future dividends over the next 20 30 years but what you 're getting is the cash today that you can use to invest you 're not going to get those dividends today going to get those dividends over the next 30 years so I just get a bit concern when I see the sentences like that which are not accurate and it may lead people to believe that that 's actually the truth which it isn 't so the thing is there 's a bunch of trade-offs here so for example you want to a cruise terminal which I think it 's a great idea we need capital for that if you want to invest in some brothers stuff you need capital but we need the capital today that so many things that people want to do today as opposed to over the next 30 years so I just thought I 'd raise that and also further ask a question about the rates increase when you said the board would support a small additional increase in rates as an alternative to assets else is that an increase on top of what 's being proposed yes so you 're saying you always some support for it so over eight point seven five percent yes and that was support from the community at large or the community board I just have to allow you to know anyone we can only buy roots there was there were three members at how submissions committee and that was the agreement with those three members and they would be made they would be making that recommendation to Council on the strength of their knowledge of what they are hearing in the community I just like to respond to your the purpose of the quit that the sentence that you 've picked out there about the purpose of holding strategic is the revenue stream that links board about the impact on people on fixed incomes of not having the that the assets provide for the future to keep it doesn 't provide but that 's the point it doesn 't provide a cushion it 's simply a trade-off of whether you have the capital today where you have a cash flow in the future well exactly the same number in fact you could argue that if we 're only receiving say a three percent dividend return now and paying five and a half percent and dev but actually today we 're better off in terms of liquidating that I mean I think this is a question that I think all of the community boards are going to have to take on board and the fact that you allowed time for questions rather than using the time to present doesn 't mean you have to answer that question I think it 's a point that 's that that could be made to all of the community boards and there are there 's more ways just going to cat then just a pure sell down and I don which is the point that your community board made and I think that 's a that 's a genuinely held view and it 's one that 's pretty universally held I don 't think anyone wants to see a fire sale or the wholesale sell down about asset base I think I think people are frightened they are yeah and I can understand why when it 's presented in a particular way but you don 't have to answer that question here now it 's a epson embrace I mean needs to take on board is that people don 't understand what he 's saying and they fear that we are trying to reflect it I know and and and you 've be really interesting because this is the debate that we need to have and it is the debate that we 've been kind of encouraging people to have ever since last year when we started an engagement which seed that there are different levers you can pull and not one of them is going to do it on its own exactly yeah on perception of but basically how i did a public talk on the assets three or four weeks ago and actually explained to my counselor Johansson was ruled out for this very matter I have a point of order simmer us yeah I 'm explaining yeah I monster asking this question because it 's quite important thats also community just needs to understand whether rather than focus on the one community board it is an issue that we do need to raise and they are wider issue so that 's why we 're not responding to say actually it 's a fear from the fourth Labour government emotes than anything and other on sale of assets that and to stall the residue of that within communities like Littleton you 're a profoundly affected yeah and that 's understandable so and you know you do represent a particular area and there is only Jurassic there but there is also major investment required so I guess that that 's why it 's come up in your context but I kind of want to focus on some of the other things that you 've got on your submission you then focus on that and I i 'm gonna i 'm just going to sort of kind of note this littleton marina and barnes development because i know that when i first went out and did a poor company visit around that whole area i agree it 's a disgrace then the way that it 's been left and in the recovery of of the port if there is a capacity to actually invest and that as a community facility i think that would be an absolute 11 and i 'm sure that the poor company would want to see it that way as well so but you 're raising a concern which is have we put anything on budget for us and i suspect the answer to your question is no we haven 't and so the question is going to be where are we going to find the support for that and at what point and the planning process do we do that there 's also an issue from the recovery plan and that the choice of cruise site is the naval point one that has a big a site that 's already tightly constrained and that would add initial constraints the additional constraints is the community formed a view on that in terms of the cruise ship location I 'm not aware of a specific one coming up yet yep it 's a would be mixed views at the store all the community groups that are involved in this naval point development plan process I think they probably realize that the there would be as the sites already constrained by the rock fall risk and the contaminated land there 's a there 's about six or seven community organizations operating out of there and it 's already really tight just to get their existing activities on their reorganized sensibly and if some of that land gets taken for the crews booth that makes it even tighter so without having talked to them specifically about this I think there 's a concern I know from one organization that there is anyway yeah okay Ellie be helpful on that note to communicate what came out of the last meeting that we had we 've got a working group here the phrase that was used coming out of that when we looked at the Dampier Bay location was we 're all on the same page then so it was quite tier from that meeting community and the port and the people are at meeting all said that the cruise terminal they were looking at at dampier Bay we 're all on the same page there is no don 't don 't pay about patter that 's naval point for the cruise dampier base to ferry terminal so naval point was the good the cruise area dumpy obeys the the inner harbor location for the ferry yeah yeah but I mean it 's just I mean it 's good because there 's a process there 's a separate process going on and what you 're saying to us as the community board is in order to support that process we need to put money on budget in order to ensure that we can actually deliver on it you know depending on the outcome and the question will be the timing of there yep so it may well be that it 's bearing in mind that we 've seen very publicly that this is a base case proposition that we 're putting out consultation and and and what we 're hearing submissions on we know that we 're going to have to start again on the first of July because we 've got an obligation to continually update this document it can 't_''_907.62 be seen as your stock standard 10-year LTP it 's not and there are a number of issues that have come up when people have referenced the individual activity management plans which have you know sort of highlighted the fact that there hasn 't been a strategic focus by the Council on the different components that make up the costs that that either go to activities or go to the capital program so I mean if that means that after the recovery plan goes through its process we have to review that then that 's exactly what we have to do yep all right okay right who shall move on thank you very much Paul of it 's much appreciated and Adrian as well _"

    "text": "thank you madam mayor councillors um thank you for the opportunity to be heard in support of our submission you 've got your our submission in front of you and it deals with quite a lot of points many of which are citywide eschews that I have no doubt that you will hear from many groups over the next few days and so we 've decided to concentrate on stuff that is mostly award specific for us and key things from our community instead of those big city wider shoes the board is seeking to be involved in a range of council activities and seeks early involvement when decisions are being made or project started that involve our ward or our community board and we acknowledge that post-quake a lot of the focus has been on rebuilding the city and replacing what has been lost but we also need to remember as we go through this long-term planning process that prior to the quakes they were communities that didn 't have anything to start with and so we can 't forget those communities in this rebuild process and that will many facilities one of the key points and a submission revolves around a pool for the southeast and you 'll notice that in the sports and recreation facilities community outcomes the first one is giving people equitable access to parks open spaces recreation facilities and libraries it 's really important that throughout the city people have equal access to counsel facilities and you 'll note that further down no mess depopulation as the rumors of the eastern suburbs has occurred post crank acknowledging that most of the growth is at least this map of Christchurch is not very clear up there it 's very bright here 's several small red dots on it that show they currently planed enough or existing council indoor pool facilities so there 's that Eastern weaken supporters there on the qe2 grounds Graham Condon jelly park for a new years in the air even though we know that future is a completely certain the new Metro sports pioneer and well for the southwest Leisure Centre you 'll notice that if you draw a line through the middle C of Christchurch up and down that 's east and west and the availability of those recreation facilities especially under aquatic the East does have several outdoor aquatic facilities but they don 't run swimming lessons or provide for all year round facilities like the other facilities do the long-term plan has 17 million dollars without green daughters for a pull into them with woolston area but that is an adequate and we found out recently that it seems to be a figure pulled out of thin air not based on any real costings in 2011 the Graham condom pool which isn 't big enough cost 13 million dollars so to put 17 million dollars for Paul and four or five years time and is not going to build a facility in their area that suits the needs of the population there we also submit that having purely an aquatic facility with no sports halls is also an equitable as the other areas will have those and this area with a lower socioeconomic demographic does not have any of those kind of facilities available for its us staff and in the aquatic facilities review and say that a the south-east at the moment and this is blatantly untrue a private facility provides no recreation facilities it is swimming lessons only and the costs are outside anything that the people in that area can afford while some of the people in the bays suburbs may send their children there for swimming lessons and people actually in lynnwood can 't_''_286.49 do it even though it 's writing them about their community because it 's too expensive council facilities offer 25 percent discount off their slightly lower listen fees anyway for people with community services card which the majority of people in this area people in this area also don 't it 's one of the areas with the lowest car ownership and usage in the city and from anywhere in the lynnwood Woolston philipstown bromley area it would be to bus trips into the new metro facility and which is on the west side of the central city and the eight schools in the area have made a submission to the long-term plan and favor of having a pool in the area and hoping that it will be brought forward 22 of the primaries limited end benefit I think bromley one of the other have a small that both of those two have a small outdoor summer only pull none of the others have pools and so the board would like both more funding for a leisure centres including sports halls and an aquatic facility with Lane recreation and learn to swim facilities and but also like that funding brought forward one of the ways which this could be funded is through spending this on the metro sports and being that it has a lower residential population in the area we submit that the recreation facilities may not be quite as necessary is that a 50 meter pool and those other ones but having facilities in urban areas like the for sports facility States one of those as much more so provide services that are available locally within the urban areas and increase participation and recreation and sporting activities all of those things are satisfied by community swim facilities and recreation facilities not necessary by a major major major sports in the middle of town when it comes to other find out how four hundred thousand dollars disappeared from the rebuild of the wall stone volunteer library last year councillors agreed to a plan of work in the second tranche of the year of the community facilities and inherited rebuild which included that point one point six million dollars for the rebuild offers key facility and them in the heart of them would end the heart of woolston village somehow in the last three months four hundred thousand dollars has come off that and I understand how we I know where it 's gone it 's gone to the Red Cliffs library because the money that council had ring-fenced for there hadn 't been put on the budget but for it to come off another facility in a lower socioeconomic area that desperately needs community facilities because it 's not a right we asked for this information several times over the last several months including it the meeting we had that Pierre mentioned and sort of several weeks ago and we still have had no reply to that and it 's really disappointing that funding should be cut for that and you yep so it 's line number and one 95 90 and on your submission page so it just assistance of easily content of an order because with Shh team the chassis woolston library and toilets when we put out a chill submission and we were still trying to work behind the scenes to try and work out what had happened to that funding because the document that we went through when we hit the workshop with councils and community boards and looked at that ranch to pay her 1.6 million dollars for woolston and that there 's some notes on here which say it 's been taken to go to somewhere else so sorry so the amount that was originally inert yep was 1.6 and what wasn 't now 1.25 1.25 and you 've not received any reply from staff on they 're not as to how that happened we know we know why they wanted to take it to give it to another facility but not why it came off that one or why they didn 't try and increase the overall total or or anything and community boards to gain information on the capital program okay we also asked at that point how the at that meeting how the figure for the lynnwood Paul was come up with and and no one was able to give us an answer for that except for a general I 'll probably just an estimate madatha near kind of thing a bit more than Graham condom head but there were no costings done on it okay philipstown community center the way of community facilities Feldstein community center is currently I 'm Ministry of Education land and its people be aware the school is closed they 've currently got a one year lease with monthly rollover but we need to start planning for that community who 's in there now the community center is still there there 's a community hub started up fantastic community project but it 's month by month Elise after a year from the mystery of education today we have watched over the site and the Technology Center there are projects and plan though they 're not until the ministry 's decided watch tool and it 's center which was I think it was owned by council were managed by a trust and so that trust has simply got some temporary access into the school no I 'm aware of something else and I there 's a visit is that there 's a group from the community of trying to do a community hub somewhere including possibly a community center but we need to be involved in any sort of planning bit and looking at what 's going happen to that community center in the community via is announcer but the Ministry of Education could use it for a similar purpose I mean it won 't be a second that 's right but we don 't know okay all right okay and we also submit that community grants while we understand from the working party and recent briefings that the community board funding is going to nominally be enhanced metro funding is being cash and we know as community boards that the last two years running community groups have come to community boards because metro has run out and it puts extra pressure on our funding and so I 'm sorry I thought that everyone had been advised that there was a mistake we don 't sign off on any reduction in the budget the to be seasons then that Metro is still gone down that well the two percent was a mistake and it was and it 's we 're reviewing the whole about yeah it 's a pro itunes to you basically replace it with a more resilience lens and and focus but I thought that there had been confirmed to everyone though we 're likely to get more to people with Metro projects coming to the community boards like they have in the last two years for the discretionary funding because they made sure I discretionary has run out so kids to town was one of those in the one before that was piece of cake yes they 're worthy projects that needed funding but they were definitely Metro projects in Metro fund had been expended though it 's clarify that include like the wards discretionary spending like an increase in that is that where you referring we 've we 've hidden a small yeah no and the other thing is the community newsletters there was a glitch during the year web there hasn 't been a lot of funding allocated to community newsletters but there are central parts for the community to get to communicate with each other and having something in your leisure boxes from from members of the communities often much more effective than an email that gets deleted quite quickly we know that our communities really value their local newsletters and funding ran out very quickly the last funding year and so communities newsletters were stopped and then symbol family was found and I quite sure we 're from but their funding needs to be enhanced so that community news leaders can be still produced by council help with the community resilience moving on from communities their time is flying through and most people won 't have heard of the motoki waterway it 's referenced four times and the flood task force report and that is not on any council programme of work currently even though my Chloe was very clear to the community at hiscott that it needed funding and it 's highlighted and you know I serious re-naming under vigil staff members is really an appropriate and I really appreciated that you didn 't yeah sorry in the development of morgan 's Valley the motoko waterway is a large open swale and it 's been has been funded so far through development contributions in the in the area however the rest of the development has stopped because it 's all red zone and council had purchased many years ago a section of land from the landowners that you can see highlighted in yellow through the red zone there and that section of land it 's council-owned it 's about I think 15 to 20 meters wide was designed to have the rest of the swale in it to link up with the the wrister because the it 's 400 meters long the swale is completed on either side of it but currently the water gets diverted down one meter wide drain through between two people 's property and it is not big enough for the capacity the flood task force report makes really clear that it is under temporary arrangement it 's 400 meters that was originally due to be funded by development contributions those development contributions will no longer be coming and it needs to be founded by commensal do you know what the budget is poor there was no project costings done because it from what I hear it had been messed because staff assumed it was going to be funded through development contributions and so does been completely must only be no costings done a flood task force reports a recommends that that it gets real looked at is a project and prioritized but it has been left off and it wasn 't put on the infrastructure strategy at all it 's not anywhere i have asked and asked and never can find it anywhere it may be and then it might be in the amorphous land drainage recovery program I don 't know not named yet there is a whole bunch of the land drainage recovery program that we here in either costed or or or put on budget I mean this petite amoveo got ya 400 million on budget potentially 1.2 billion yeah is that it 's not yeah no no we 'll follow it out that would be great and there were five houses directly fighter to volleyball but within their overcoat its bridle path road there the the small bit where it 's overflowing to the top right of the picture where it 's just coming over we branched here is the actual bit of drain and the drain is not that the driveway to the left of it and the entire street that it 's flowing down was a river couldn 't see the side of the street then flowed down from there into power whole place down Marsden down station under the bridge into policies I went and looked yeah yeah that needs doing and at this point I 'm going to hand over to Isla thank you first of all I 'd like to or counselors and me attention to our submission on housing where we support the counsels performance targets for social housing particularly the provision of at least 60 additional homes but we do strongly recommend that the council gets in touch with the government and seat s houses in lynnwood park in there are 50 domain after they have been that they 've finished doing the earthquake recovery week there was an opportunity lost despite the community boards best efforts when the granny flats that were built and intended to be plumbed interceptions on their helpful they plant the houses that were going to be youth quite prepared as a big enough situation the grain flakes were going to be put in there but there wasn 't an uptake so they were stalled in Barbados street for months somebody in they disappeared because they 've been solved and the they were sold to dairy farms and all sorts but that was an opportunity lost that given that we 're now looking to provide homes for the homeless and other people who are finding difficulty finding homes at the moment those screen effects would have been absolutely ideal so I would be allowed to see that opportunity lost again looking at regional parks is the alcohol why we 're out and that people have referred to as well talking about increasing funding for the regional park the increase in funding for kids in education which is absolutely fantastic at Stowe there at that the council is supporting an increase in it and we fully support there but the pressure on regional park rangers right across the board is quite extreme they are supported by conservation groups such as the summit road society and in particular the case that was raised by a guerrilla war era was pist control and the conservation groups i 'm on the summit road society i can tell you that three groups go out in Summit Road society every week doing basically pest control weeding planting and tripping in the budget has been touched for the park rangers in the current year and we would really suggest that that it 's reinstated in fact even if increased because if you go down to fury meet right now you 'll see rabbits all over the show at giving central otago run for the money and we really need to do get on top of this because otherwise it 's a false economy now just up you can see this is over we were truly a guided tour of the Heather unfortunately it was in relation to stormwater ends into drainage end of flooding issue and the ite committee and the land drainage staff took us a last Friday one of the line items in the plane of the LTP is for the lower heathcott master clean and this is a project that staff have included to effectively clean up the contributor ease to the lower his cut and I went out with I 'm a member of the heat I trust and they 're very keen to be involved in it and I took these photos and throw people 's look through them this is the start of it and ten years ago the council Rangers tided this up it was absolutely immaculate and this is what happens if you let something go 14 years the this is just by the wall stone library attending the next shot you 'll see further down as the grill where everything 's being done and so it 's just a perfect look at that it 's a perfect case in point of what needs to be budget line in particular will be further enhanced row because of the voluntary voluntary organizations that will support the council ranges in the drainage staff to assist with this urgently needed work that needs to be done the last met for me is an item on page 13 of this document which went out to everybody it 's the smart choices document and in its ears but we do know the financial constraints applied to the scoot program mean that while the parts of the city infrastructure they 've been replaced and now in much better condition than pre 2010 some will be returned to the city in a worse condition then pre-earthquake and we 'll have a reduced remaining life and we submit that there is unacceptable thank you great any questions we 're at the 20 months so well yeah you just got played um you 're aware that the returns owned by ciara not council so that 's no longer in our land and you 've got in tourism itaku no no that 's aliens appalled with purchase land privately and it 's not resigned I said it 's not privately owned so that that section beer that 's highlighted is actually white on the map it is not read zoned land council owns it yeah yeah we 're good I think that you 've raised a large number of issues that will have to go through obviously in detail thank you very much but I don 't care EG to listen to the submissions from our community members as well so being in your clothes thank you thank you very much right

    "text": "now each community board has loosely 20 minutes so and that should allow us a bit of you know time for questions and comments and things like X so if you would like to start off I 'm sorry we haven 't got everyone back in the room yet but that 's right I haven 't got a hat for this occasion sir I am we know what your hair is this it 's but in front of you I 've put a few comments about getting closer to the community finding new approaches to community outcomes of community governance what have we got what works what 's possible how do we get the communities grow and flourish to become more resilient and caring for all in our community looking for a community empowerment and the flexibility to not to adopt new ways of doing things and it 's about working with the council to become a strong leader providing services at appropriate level and community-based people in our communities empowered to design and deliver services and play an active role in our local communities single jaw and joined up just wanted to outline their down there and under those bullet points that there are some truly amazing things that are happening in our community at the moment there are others as well the likes of the opportunity hit the contract for the ekor I worry reward based locally but these are just some of the things that are important we were working in partnerships with people and getting on with the job and at the same time I must say having fun and understanding issues so it really is what community governance is all about so we can all we can also celebrate those other things like the repair and reopening of the museum the Gaiety and hopefully the service centers shortly and I could not could not forget to mention this stunning repair of the almost completed thanks peninsular war memorial and the funds that council contributed to us were very valuable as an amazing War Memorial and it 's had it they 've had it scope taken off or it some bled rep taken off what Anzac Day looked superb and the scaffoldings gone up into to finished shortly so look at this here this is a pile of plans and i love them i could do with a bit of ultra-fast broadband in my area and i 've downloaded them as you can see there 's a number of places there where i 've looked at them and there 's what there 's a couple there that are very important documents i think that everybody should have a look at strategic policy and planning combines and the infrastructure strategy 2015 2045 they are great reading or good background mushrooms a great reading but they 're good background information to what we 're doing and they 're important and moving ahead so it 's good background reading an important strategy outlining the significant deck activities water supply wastewater stormwater flood protection and control works roads and footpaths emerging issues and increasing community expectations are going to have considerable impacts particularly for our small communities and we need to find a way to fund some of those activities that is fair to all parties someone who lives in the city gets good access to water supplies and wastewater at increasing considerable costs an issue that someone owning or buying rural land does not always understand roads are also vastly different and this is one of the major issues that rural rural rate type players continue to raise there is made the only perception that standards there is maybe only position at the stage that standards are exciting and it 's dis considerable rate though the strategic policy and planning document there was one matter that we actually lived out of submission out of our submission and I have included that on the back of your paper I think you 've got one there I have met you got here in front of me but it talks about page 21 and the ecological surveys and I 've I copied in the activity management plan that covers their the eighty thousand dollars is that there in that paper right so that 's one that we missed out of our submission that 's very important that support package to landowners important to the success of the process and I 've attached pages from the report event from Monticello property and if one that I talked about earlier in the document there that talks about that policy and the funding and now in our area on our properties so if we go to the submission then and it 's um we thank you for the opportunity to to submit on the plan and there are a number of things that how do we get our submissions to our annual plan well if they actually come from years civil years of long-term plans that roll over each year almost and end up in this long-term plan once again so it 's a it is challenging for us and we hope that some of those are taken into consideration in particular as the seawalls further through the document you 'll see thats on we should have actually numbered the page it 's the third page in seawalls their talks about harbours and marine structures and the a and the activity management plan with reference to only to see walls and it 's noted that most of the other seals are included and other activities parks and transport but they 're not even mentioned in but the sea walls as it is in the tonkin retailer report are an amazing concept or amazing barrier not a concept that amazing barrier that has actually protected our towns and our small settlements over many years not much work has done on them and we need to see that improved and that 's we can 't retreat but we need to work through those issues anyway and we 're looking at perhaps prepare a database of sea wolves and their current condition so that funding can be allocated in subsequent years of the long-term plan and maintenance renewal where necessary I mean all of these issues and here are important you know the the wolves and the duties and we 've got some communities that are very excited about being able to become involved in those and partner with other organizations to get them back together using them as they were meant to be used not being locked behind a fence as a number of them are already the echo I 'll wolf renewal will our old Wharf it 's a historic Wharf unfortunately and we 're asking start planning for that much sooner rather than later it needs to be done but it 's um it 's going to be a challenge understanding that it is a historic Wharf the regional parks and under net down under here are very important activities for our being spinach to community not only for visitors but they also encourage us to work together with those other landowners beside the regional parks and worked as a amazing relationship that gets joined up as I mentioned earlier and the earlier pages of that and we 're concerned to hear that there is a less of a budget being allocated to that so you see that we support their the spine of the lizard project rod Donald 's trusts spider the lizard project that may have a change of name shortly but it runs around the top of the hills and connects parts of Gibby 's pass around to the tops of port of hilltop sort of in that area so we 're seeing some Omega amazing walkways being introduced in that area and if you 're a few our land manager and hope that they will look up the operational pest management programs for the regional parks we have to manage our weeds on our properties and so should the council and there 's the lake Forsythe I don 't think we can actually find that in in the long-term plan and I asked at a meeting recently where we talked about catapult projects and I think I was told it was an operational matter but the issue of the of the lake of opening of the lake of lake forces to brochure arera needs to be well it needs to be concluded this issue of the of the the joint application resource consent for this has been has taken a number of years and continues to roll on so we just hope that the considerable amount of funding there to resolve that issue stormwater renewals well that their issues everywhere throughout the city as well but there are also in our area where we 've got very old storm water systems and many knots or no storm water systems and Little River there as it talks about their problems and the talk about Little River again and place-based panning if the the last sentence and that parent that little box there the development of the strategic plan for the Little River Community would reflect the preference for a place-based panning as discussed and the strategic policy and planning we 've just started and the last week formed a small group that are looking at Little River the salt river has had several plans many plans undertaken over the years and subtle just sat on the shelf have never been picked up so we did a thousand funding last year put an issues and dr. Ochs options document together and want to progress that further towards now towards a suburban type plan or a play space planning document it 's got some amazing people are not McDonald from the Canterbury District Health Board he was with the City Council thanks for little district council Susan valence from Lincoln University you know there are a number of professionals there that a planner from the City Council as well that 's going us ahead to do it all works on contract with the city and that we need to get on with the job and come up to something that will hopefully feed into the long-term plan down the tread so in relation to the cycle way we would like to think that the cycleway is actually integrated into this this little river plan as well that it seems to be important that we have everything all working together and not things and not fraction ate it free feast over there we follow and I 've just got here accra 175 this year and there 's a number of programs that are going on a garage area school labor production and June you ziam has an evening readings from 1840 there 's a whole host of events taking place and you can have a look on the fri com site but this some this festival needs some long-term planning around it and some ongoing fans around us roads and footpaths at the bottom of the page was a disappointing document for me when for us when we read it it doesn 't sort of give the feeling of that we were part of it have been dull have been done away from us as communities and we haven 't had an opportunity for important and understanding of what those issues what those issues are so we hope that they 're all be addressed down the track and there are some things that we 're actually asking there to be to be done for example the roads to be ranked in order of priority would receive the the first priority funding we also need to look at paper roads and and policies around bows as well working with the council so look I appreciate the opportunity to make comments on the long-term plan we do have concerns about the submission process for the long-term plan we need to have more information earlier and involvement and the Pro and the activity management plans they were in December 2014 and many of them we sort of didn 't find and talk much and it was very difficult it was very difficult to identify any matters directly benefiting two banks peninsula really has become a challenge but apparently was at some sage you could put on banks financial bring all the across sites up you know in the the formation of that plan on the website but we can 't do that any longer we have to troll through everything but look I 've really thoroughly enjoyed reading these amazingly and and and some of the other board members have as well and have contributed to things perhaps I for one thing I haven 't talked about a cemeteries the dead end so we 'll make this the dead end and we 're having issues around our cemeteries mariah has got no symmetry space left for some residents that are there other than those of already booked plots and things so we would like to progress some sort of a discussion around the symmetries and how we might move forward it 's no good being told you can go to devotions when you live an acre I you want to be where you love so that 'll be the DD edge excellent thank you and I was surprised when you said that you had to download because I thought that these ones have been made available to community office I didn 't pick it up i 'll pick it up i told these home I mean I learn when they didn 't make them available for under bday where you say we 're in the office yes they were in the office yeah I could have picked it up but I found this I mean I had these so yeah right but you look like your time you found out about these you 'd already printed it off well these aren 't enough yes sir paul is leah technical manager plants yep but i will always be weird that sorry was it made totally aware to me of me that that 's where they were they 're not on it sorry no no they 've got but they 've got the list of them and the and what 's been changed and what 's been needed no I 'm sorry I don 't_''_864.02 I wasn 't aware that they had much in it okay so I got all of us through these so I mean that that just shows that you know perhaps we went well enough informed i mean it is certainly true that the activity management plans hit more detail but there doesn 't mean they 're hit more information yeah anyway but all right so question Andrew just two very quick questions just to drill down a little bit further payment or a couple of points that you made and thanks to the very full submission in this afternoon I 'm just coming back to the the last point you made around the cemeteries yes what would you be looking for there would that require a review of the cemeteries master plan or the purchase of land well yes it what neither what solution of that most definitely both opposed to explore ideas of what we might do where we might go if it is a dead end we would like to find a resolution to it okay great thank you and then just coming back to the comments that you made about strategic planning for Little River yes and the board is requesting that funding being included you have a ballpark figure that you would be looking for to do that work and is we were going to put that in is there something else that you would move further down the list to make way for it so this is about funding for the suburban style play the little river um suburban start plan yet well I wouldn 't know what sort of costs goes around a suburban style plan but we already have a lot of information around it that 's been drawn into the issues and options document that 's available and it identifies all of the all of them you know the papers that have been prepared so it 's it 's not a visitor that it 's going to be a huge costly process to do it I mean it 's already been a lot of consultation with the community that will need to be some consultation around it but yeah it 's not I 'm sorry I can 't just call all the document out but we have got a document that supports many of those things there that we 're we 're talking about and this document here and another surprising piece of information is that we got a puppy guy younger area in a little river that covers quite a considerable amount of land we need to understand what that actually means and what I mean may not impact on anybody but we don 't know what it means so the district land is as impacting on little river plus the sum then land change they 've changed the names from commercial development to open space which is of concern so there are district plan work but needs to go on around this suburban-style study our full thanks Pam just with regard to the cycleway when my understanding is that it 's really just the last piece towards a little river township that needs to be completed well yeah I think that 's all it does need to be completed but we haven 't been kept up the pet up to up to speed with what 's happening the dial M&C and then the the link of course of the city one I think it 's called Corey man 's trail which comes in from all the road is Paul look what list around you around of stuff around the regional and neighborhood parks yes and I just want to feel some systemic or and here at issues or was a disc funding that it better the problems well some of these parks have have funding and some of them don 't they 've got management pens around them like for example the garden of town aid has a management plan around it so his Stanley Park takapa Nikki we 're just under way with a reserve management plan but the Cannes Bay of has some fun they have a camping ground they have their own generate their own funds but we noticed in there and the activity management plan that there was a considerable amount of funding allocated to a Cannes Bay so the question was who was it for I mean should they should the reserve management committee the camping ground should they be funding the things that are doing that that are happening with him the camping ground rather than calling on the City Council to provide some of those assets or whatever it was allocated to in the plan but of course but is a visitor site as well tourists and visitors so yes and and we were just looking at these small committees that didn 't get any funding needed to have a little bit of funding that they could do it 's good to have a little bit of money that they can spend each year to do a project or two and have a year after year not one you have it like the likes of the garden Tommy it had it for a number of years and then there was was no none one year so it 's better to have funding and the suggestion is that perhaps some funding be allocated to the to the board and that we have the opportunity to allocate it working with those preserve management committees to allow them to do some words and are we ethically looking after the weed problems in the reserves you sort of touched a bit on a week and well the weed issues in those ones years certainly in the garden at are made there 's a team of a fine team of people behind that and do things and yes they 've got weeds and pecks in fact they 've probably got pests as well they 've got possum strips and things dealing with it yet Stanley Park also they 're very passionate about big Orson their broom and those other weeds that suddenly appear so yes they will be doing that and they 're reserved and their reserve management plan and the one with Robinson 's Bay there 's a lovely reserve in Robinson 's Bay that it 's got amazing signage and things on it a place worth going to see not terribly well known at the stage a considerable amount of funding was suggested to that site and and then we have got the robinsons bay wharf or results and ratepayers association that i said hey look why they got all that money we could do a bit over here why not share that funding and you 'll hear from them later in the week sometime about how they would like to share the funding that 's been allocated to that that Jimmy we got into the regional park the table to budget and the your order particular men 's you would like to be involved in the privatization work you know you have a kind of support let 's focus on plenty but like spending more for management be in the pest control my questions except these items have any other project or any other program or facility you also rely together involve you know with the staff reveal the prioritization for our ties which party can ability for which party that is urgently have any the least intention on that in regards to this table 2.1 prize that Jimmy I don 't understand your question yes yeah this is in relation to regional parks these are the likes of tioga musty peaks on we 're referring to on banks financial oh really and as looking at those those parks that are around us that are important to our communities and where we 're costs could be reduced and be involved in that process okay well thank you thats some the 20 minutes so i 'm just mindful of effect that I don 't know whether you staying till the end that 's a nice out on you 're all having you and put excellent thinking so I mean if things go well timing-wise then we maybe I 'll forget people around the table again right at the very right so the next one _"

    "text": "merchant 's son I think you 're representing yourself and acura museum Advisory Committee my head just a show which witch hat you 've got on your which place I 've got on today so the first one is my farming head of which I 'm very proud to win my sore thumb hit so there we are now I haven 't got my gum boots I 'm finely dressed I being you 've got you what 's all in your pocket those i hope this over 16 poppy or 17 copies of that that i will talk about in my my own submission and then was one of those years place and there 's one who proposed for each of those and this one is it just really been it very short and sweet and it 's about things that I 'm very passionate about it is about the banks peninsula the biodiversity and understanding the issues and feeling good about source and excited and want you to do things so in the first part of the submission I talked about the work of the links for nature conservation about the bank 's potential banks financial Conservation Trust they 've the work but it does in our community now it was started as a result of a very poor district plan proceeds back in 2001 and here we are still today toiling away at and resolving those very same issues about ecological significance and the importance of looking after it and caring for it but if we 're going to feel comforted about things we actually have to be an excited little group of people or or someone champion ear and pushing it along so I 'm just asking that you support the bank 's pledge to conservation trust I think they 're coming with it with a submission sometimes further down the tracks I 'm sorry that I 'm not sitting behind them but i 'm here today and i hope that you 'll support them when that comes to the table you do need people to drive things very important that you have people to drive things and and provide them with information the second bit of the other submission some as about the identification of a on between the fourth of april i had a quick look at what was in the and the draft plan will draft district plan around significant ecological sites and we have here we 've had to that I 'd been identified in our property now I understood that yes they probably will because I understand that they are pretty significant but I was surprised to see it before we actually been really notified that we were going to be included in the plan so I 'm looking forward to the letter that comes to me but because we 've got a a site and if you look at the strategic quali policy planning combined behind there you 'll see a bit there about chapter nine excellent cultural heritage sites of ecological significance and I 've only just given you one page from our on the start of our document that talks about our land and our and our piece you 'll see that it 's quite high up it is a lovely piece but if you go to the second page the air page 128 5 and that I 've landowner about benefits discussions with landowner about the benefits assistance available where appropriate so that brings me back to the the documents that were behind the long-term plan the strategic policy and planning combined activity management plan and there in page 21 of it and i have included that page 20 well it talks about a support package for landowners with sites of ecological significance so I 'm just asking that you actually support the some this key change in the long-term plan and included as part of the budget it 's not a lot of money but a little bit of money sometimes can go a long way and we 're just that we 're asking for support for information and and others so that some that 's all I would like to say that my farming bits and hope that you will support the bank 's potential Conservation Trust and some funding for sites of ecological significance they are very much like your heritage homes and you do provide you know you provide funding for those and information and support for those so here is his culture of so that 's the end of that piece did anyone have any questions on that nope that 's I think that 's a pretty straightforward submission from you came right off that we 're used to anything other than straightforward submissions from it yep now the future of our armament museum right well I 'll put my now put on my car away we 're a community board cheer yeah look and yes and so this is Sam the era of music as an advisory committee that that sits behind it and works along with us and that this committee includes community members and community board members and the a corral museum director attends those meetings and the purpose of those meetings as of that committee is provide to the community board information a provide advice on strategic issues facing museum and matters arising from them now wonder to give you some exciting things about the museum start off with that Linda Wallace the museum director and her team do an amazing job some of the activities beaten recently being reported on a recording of visitors numbers origin of visitors disposal research and access etc now i have actually just did i get that out to a slide that here 's another piece that you could whistle around showing where all the visitors come from so Linda as does some sterling work real professional and her job and you know we get involved in working at acura newseum research and access policy there 's a number of policies that we all put together as a group in the museum at the moment strengthening steel is going into the repair we 're all excited about that there 's the imminent appointment of an exhibition designer with the funds for this coming from fundraising and the team works very hard to help the christchurch city council by finding extra funding and effects we found the h2 500,000 from work from the ministry of culture and heritage and and a lot of the funds that extra funding has been sought for betterment so when you come to look at the the our submission from the advisory committee of what China I 'm the chair we were a little disappointed to find in the not or some of the information was not correct and it was not written with all the museum direction director had not been included as part of the writing of that management plan so it 's very disappointing to see that he left outside that process there were some surprising things that came out of it like being suggested that it makes good says to a good sense to ask canterbury museum to manage the echo museums there were some surprising things that came out of it and certainly we 're very disappointed and how things came about with that management plan so you 've got the submission there in front of you and as I said a lot of a funding that we here are getting is from what we 've found what for what linda has found herself to bring to the table if you look at the grits the pie charts there have you all got one and that goes back to one of those statements the I think I 've given them all to you now that fine when it talks about twenty-four percent of the that 's when you when you add to give a christchurch city area there and the peninsula that is from the chart of december january to december 2014 where there is a talk there of seventeen thousand visitors and the one over the back is a bit longer twenty-one thousand visitors and it looks as though we will reach 25,000 visitors this year to the museum so if you remember also the the charges and the museum were dropped recently and as a result more people have come to the museum to see it so that some it 's a very valuable little hub in our community it 's not only for visitors but our community get great value from it so thank you look at seven minutes what are not quite well yeah you 've got a bit of time but I have to say that when i read your submission i was very disappointed that there hadn 't been that consultation so and I 'm fact was quite shows and they were really wasn 't anything and the activity management plan process that we love so much and that there hadn 't been any consultation so you know I guess that it 's highlighted for me what is a major deficiency and in a process so it seems that in looking for reductions across a budget and the activity management plan process that focuses council staff to look at silos rather than to look across the board because I mean you can 't you couldn 't transfer it to the museum anyway because the museum is a separate trust it has a deed and it 's governed by legislation so I mean I just I was completely you know blown away by so I you know kind of would like to apologize and will certainly take that on board and revealing that particular activity management plan Thank You Ellie the entrance to the museum we did that at the last activity management plan right in the last annual plan right is there any provision for donation yes yes the resident age it was a condition or removing it and the real am yeah Linda does keep the records of how many cents per visitor is paid or how what it is off the top of my head with we would like an update on that actually right I 'm like how much was being received by way of charging and how much has received now because I know the visitors numbers have gone up now that we 've taken the charges off yes but it 'd be interesting to see whether we could be doing more to encourage donations well it certainly does impact minutes no doubt EMPs yeah and the museum has lost or maybe maybe 30 or 40 thousand dollars and not quite sure if it was that high yeah but we need the motive knows what the facts are yes yes is well they do sell merchandise as well so perhaps it would be good sometime for a presentation on what the f RR museum does for you all there are an amazing little group and Linda 's a fine professional behind ya know it 's an amazing facility alright so now well I think we 're going to take an adjournment now and where 345 would you to start at four o 'clock with minute break

    "text": "j valentine encode limited presented by us developed britain 's welcome uh maelzel and I hope you have that right I know I know it 's this made of me it 's the made a mere thing that I just oh yeah I asked outside first let me say how grateful we are for everything that the council the government and private enterprise is doing in the inner city the resultant has the potential to be a very attractive and vibrant city center and much more so Darris 8 and if we hadn 't had the earthquakes and we also understand the difficult position the council is in and that we can 't expect it to do everything we 'd like to be done and that some things we would like can 't_''_57.75 be done and today the only point we 'd like to talk about is access and in particular with reference to modal shift we support the idea of modal shift for people coming into the inner city this is the inner city being a much better place that people walk cycle or bust but we 're concerned in order to achieve this and the strategy has been evident to us and conversations over time with various people and it 's illustrated in the long-term plan for example in the parking activity management plan data theatre December page 13 and what that that identifies is the risks around parking and the first risk is that parking provision is inadequate unsafe or inaccessible and the the analysis says that if the parking provision is inadequate there will be a high business impact because businesses will become untenable because customers cannot easily get to them the second risk that 's identified is that parking supply is too high and therefore inefficient and doesn 't encourage the use of other modes to get the city now this identified as having a high impact but also a high probability and that people choose to take it to her because the parking is available and then the third risk is that parking is put a utilized high impact again high probability now that that strikes us as odd a parking orbit conducted in May 2010 I don 't find there were 1291 visitor way earlier conversations I failed to distinguish between short stay parking and long-stay parking we booking short stay parking yeah so these these car parks were actually in the literature of street parking building the crossing building and the Grand chain Chancellor car parks 1291 and they were servicing considerably this retail space then we 'll open and around October 316 and all so far these commercial space you know the Justice Department alone is going to generate nine hundred visitors a day and it 's not providing any visitor car parking at the moment the Carter building is going to produce about 400 visitor car parks Antony golfers talking about providing 200 and he 's gone so I can dare to say this I hope it gets it was there on time because he 's a bit behind schedule so we 've got 400 car parks visitor car packs in under construction and before the earthquake we had 1291 now how earth can you say that it 's a high-impact high probability that parking supply is too much it must be too little and when when when when the do their damnedest to make it appear as little of a problem as possible so we do urge you when you 're reading the reports that you get to look very critically at the assumptions that are made and at the figures that you 're presented with it seems to us it could be a disaster now as I say we do support the idea of modal change and I don 't want to divert a conversation too far away from the main point which I 've made but seems to us that if we could implement the inner city of living program a good deal faster than as being done at the moment that would actually bring about their modal change that we 're seeking to achieve the further away you live from the center of projects the less attractive the alternative modes are riding a bicycle and from where I live on hannspree Hill is essentially impossible i get wobbly legs I try and our bill and obviously if you try and walk in from holmesville that 's a two-hour walk for me I walkin from hunts predates be convenient I hate to say it but this business of handsome spokes isn 't encouraging our staff to take the passive they have doing to change they don 't like like doing that but it 's not working for me that because they change my bus route used to see I used to just drop me down the right at the end of the row now I 've got to walk about three blocks that 's an interesting point meadows L die something the contingency parking plans would require you to walk five minutes to get to the mall we 're worried about that too anyway so getting the inner city living and fast track would be something which would help achieve that modal shift and bring about a whole lot of other benefits too for the council would be more more efficient use of existing infrastructure more people and around the inner city for longer creating vibrancy and pressing the sense of safety and actually avoid the loss of ratepayers through the suburban counties a moment people are leaving a city and going and living in in sylvanor are they and as far as resident help as either the first resonance concerned they face lower traveling costs most their time when i came i was living in hallsville during our house repairs it took me 50 minutes to get work on a bus 20 once caught the bus stop 30 and that 's too take the bus and if I went by carps 15 minutes so you effect a change but if you live sinfully don 't waste all that time so most their time greater and easier access to the best public facilities the library the sports end of the art gallery the museum even the gardens and when I was first married I should 've just over the road and Montreal street corner of Montreal student here if its treatment wonder place to live there did you and we 're stable yeah we were using I love doing it can we got pregnant and they were seen to that what I didn 't the in the inner city residents are typically the two income no kids which we were then and the empty nesters which we son and a month to peer at all and I 'm ago they come back it 's called the returning my son dresses I know what does what happened that 's why is it at the moment anyway so at the moment that looks like a 10-year project if that could be speed up that would be very good I understand that that 's really a government-led part of the blueprint but maybe the council and the government could work together to affect it more quickly it 's not an ID and I 'm going to make a suggestion would likely but we the nonce idea I rate a rate decrease for people who live within the forum use now there 's the rationale for that is that you 've got this infrastructure costs you 're you 're retaining ratepayers or otherwise go out to sell one and you are assisting the modal change anyway I 'm just like finished by saying trying to affect the modal change by making parking unavailable was a recipe for disaster and our view and it could significantly limits the vision for the city us to create a world-class boutique city with a sustainable lifestyle and a healthy strong economic base that you referred to in your opening relax thank you very much thank you very much Yanni thank you very submission I 'm interesting enough we 've had a number of people say that they like us to restore the free yellow electric bus that used to go around the central city and I just wanted to get your thoughts on that you know I know obviously it stopped outside Valentine so it was probably be interesting to hear whether that 's something he would support or with any users to its effectiveness I haven 't actually thought about the yellow bus but I had wondered if we could make our normal bus services free was on the four avenues and that would encourage the long stay Parker 's turn to park and facilities that might provide a little bit further out and to use a shuttle use those as the regular shuttle rather than that into your costs by having an extra bus service very true sir very good bus services I long stakeout bag a row we land at the corner of Morehouse seven year and colombo street and you could then use the 15 minutes shuttle bus the other buses that run up and down colombo street all the time without putting another bus on it 's a gob smacking me good idea thank you yeah but I mean that you just highlighting the nuttiness of our split public transport system yes I I think it 's hearty yes I think it 's nothing to fill thanks I 'm just wondering if you had seen around the parking issue the last parking report via council were received I think we would received at the end of last month did you wonder if you saw there because it was quite it 's got a lot of specific information in relation to short-term in long-term parking and some clear recommendations yes I have seen it and I wasn 't comfortable with a lot of the recommendation to in fact it 's under consideration and collier 's are producing their own assessment of I just wonder if what I 'd say as i might be useful if yourself and in a city business people have further discussions with the council staff oh really yes indeed we are and we appreciate the opportunity to have those discussions with our pics on look thank you very much for there was some great and given us some food for thought pretty bruisers off on the way and these processes they ok _"

    "text": "ever party crashing extinct for South Branch Peter Tuffy hey no no you know I put them up to another sorry for those that are following this um we had Christchurch in Canterbury tourism but I have asked them to come and submit on another day because I felt that their submission would fit more appropriately with some of the other submissions that we 're receiving rather than today which is more the business associations the unions and the political parties thank you and in the community boards at four o 'clock Peter thank you madam mayor we believe that the assets a lot sell off that the draft plan proposes will in all probability be irrevocable we don 't think that one 's gone possession of the assets that have been sold off an enjoyment of the benefits the community currently derived from them will ever be a realistic possibility we also believe that it will represent an embracing of the key government 's privatization agenda and that will be a big step down a dangerously slippery slope we have a government that long before the 4th of sep city council sell off its commercially owned its commercial assets we have a council which after our government which after this council went through the share an idea consultation process and produced a recovery plan that was realistic in terms of the council 's financial situation then imposed a so-called blueprint that involved far greater expenditure than the previous council had deemed prudent and in our view that move and the ensuing cost sharing agreement was deliberately aimed at driving the council towards a financial position in asset sales would appear to be a tempting alternative to massive rate increases the danger that the council will face if it yields to that temptation and abandons the position it has held here to on asset sales is that it would have forfeited any principled grounds for resistance should the government subsequently seek to pressure or compel the council to sell off its remaining unsold assets for example under the threat of dismissing the elected council and appointing commissioners as was done with ECAM we wouldn 't be surprised to see that given the government 's record of bullying dictatorship over Canterbury you don 't just as there 's no such thing as being just a little bit pregnant and if the council does that and the government then says you 've agreed to privatization in principle now sold a lot the council would have thrown away any moral authority for resistance to such a demand selling off shares in community owned assets will be an open invitation to this government to compel the council to carry out a forced fire sale and as for the notion of selling shares only to strategic partners who have their communities long-term interests at heart well your put the point you previously made about Orion and Selwyn Council is well taken but whichever corporate entities be their counsel or or or company owned get their hands on the shares their first duty will be to their shareholders or to their stakeholders or ratepayers not to the community of christ church sorry madam mayor but the Tooth Fairy doesn 't exist and the council should not be trying to persuade the community that it does in our view a decision to start selling off community and very dangerous so we would urge those counselors who have the two supported the proposed asset sell-off to reflect very carefully and ask themselves whether all alternatives have truly been exhausted which in our view they have not there are we submit more possible scenarios than the four set out here on page 27 of the consultation document and they involve making reductions in the amount proposed to be spent in the ten years covered by the draft plan we 've outlined the number of alternatives in our original submission but they thought would boil down to cancellation or deferral for a start reduce the proposed capital expenditure on the government you wish list of projects that are sought to impose on us without any public consultation the government 's announcement today of a two-year up to two year deferral of so-called anchor projects worth a billion dollars gives an opportunity to do just that and correspondingly should reduce the shortfall the asset sell-off has been touted as being required to cover and add to that the approximately 500 million or is it 450 million by which we are reliably 're already it would weigh further towards eradicated the shortfall and with it any justification for the asset sell-off and also the need for rate of increase is higher than of those already proposed not only the capital projects notoriously take longer to complete than for scene which enough the further strengthens the case for reducing the capital expenditure for post for the next ten years we would suggest that some other proposed projects in addition to those already mentioned could also be sensibly pruned such as the idea of they have got a van estuary tidal barrier for example on the operating side too we are pretty sure that opportunities for savings through smarter spending could be found in plenty given the will to search for them the irrevocable nature of proposed asset sales and the consequent danger of exposure to government pressure to further sell-offs combined air view to make this a potentially faithful and perilous year in our city 's history and we urge the council to reconsider thank you thanks Peter I 've just kind of going to make the comment though that I mean I we didn 't put any money on the budget to do it so taking it off the egine that doesn 't take any money off the budget but I thought I would just pick up on one thing do you know what the difference was in terms of the costs that were in the council 's kind of share an idea draft Central City playing the amount of money they plan to spend and the amount they are now required to spend under the cost share agreement I don 't recall the exact the exact difference it was commented on at the time I believe but however much or however little it was it was generally reported as involving more expenditure than Sheriff share an idea well I mean I 'll just give one example that I 'm aware of and that is that the amount that was put aside for the Metro sports facility was for in terms of the council 's kept contribution was the amount that had been put on the budget for that facility under the central city recovery plan draft so you know that I staff to actually go through the two plans and actually show the public you know what that difference is because I think you 're right there are some elements of the difference that are hidden because of other decisions that were made you know for example I 've never really quite understood why the council decided to hand over approximately 15 million dollars probably eight million dollars net worth of residential red zone lend to the crown for nothing and return so there are elements of the two that don 't stack up there are also things that I think people have an assumption that the figure was for some you know business case reason but in fact was just to mirror the amount that the council put on the plan Phil thanks Peter just comment about the first about the history total barrier that that was really it 's really only a pre-feasibility study which is being done because a lot of people that are have asked about this and that report would come to the infrastructure transport Environment Committee before any full expiration or feasibility study was done referred to potential reduction and spending by council and i know you have another hat we get what regarding the residents association of economic but if for example it was shown that the crates to itself library was actually quite safe and while it has be monitored would you consider I just wanted to consider extending out the time we 're in fact that could be rebuilt in the future absolutely madam map absolutely that would be in our view a prime and and in in the view of whichever other hat i have to wear adsense secret presentation that would be an target foot for reduction it 's working at the at present it 's tore it to every appearance it it 's safe as it is and to close it down in the in the immediate future and embark on repairs would not only be in our view premature expenditure but would also deprive that the local community of a facility which is much needed in these distressing times totally agree clean thank you thank you Peter just in your third to last paragraph the you know the we 've got talking hour of deferral from the crown and under spend by the council is it then your conclusion that there is a sense in which this financial shortfall is actually beginning to take care of itself 1.2 billion um well it 's it 's potentially getting smaller weather had to to what extent it will take care of itself will will sort of need to you know today 's dust to settle in a bit more cool analysis to tape up but it does seem to be trending in that direction Yanni it was interesting to give you the cost of the anchor projects imposed on by the by the crown through the blueprint versus what council how can i just--can excuse me and I just enterprise you can I just interrupt and say that I 've asked I 'm gonna ask for a full set of break down with the to you I don 't want to spend question time the ten minutes is up I don 't want question time with you providing us with your view of the answer yeah it 's okay but we get the total cost of the central city anchor projects because it is 1.2 billion that is the gap that we 're facing no it 's not the game that we 're facing I 'm sorry but I don 't actually want to use the submission process is an opportunity for people excuse me Yanni we have I think it 's a matter of respect that we have a submitter here and it was an opportunity to ask him a question not make a statement is there anyone because uh because it 's not fair on almost a toughy Vicki you do like to ask questions of the decisions of the previous council does the decision to invest 350 million with a contingent liability of 650 million and to enable when the government was going to put that here anyway strike you as odd so I made me I didn 't quite hear all of counter the bucs question could she yeah no no she 's it surprisingly for Vicki she 's actually got quite a quiet voice just in terms of owning assets and trying to keep them 's was because of the liability that we have for enable does it strike you as an unusual decision that the previous council made post-earthquake to invest 350 million with a contingent liability of 650 million into that ultra-fast broadband enable at a time when they were post-earthquake faced with major repairs it does strike me as strange I 've been resisting the temptation to say anything on complimentary about the previous council but yes it does I think a number of us feel there but some right well thank you very much Peter great to see you and we really appreciate you making the effort to come along and and submit to us thank you madam there thank you and could we hear _"

    "text": "we 're the only ones who get presents could I invite the Alliance Party i think it is given you go get my present good afternoon for those of you who thought the Alliance Party was dead and buried I 'd like to introduce dennis o 'connor Martin you love myself Kevin Campbell living examples of the fact that it 's a well in alive and well this professor Jim Flynn one of our stalwart members set of us at a conference for some time ago we 're a party in waiting good things take time of course thank you for their just speaking notes that are going round apologize they went out before but it might just help you with focusing on our points you will recall in the britons or the online submission we talked about key beaming firstly myself at the 10-minute tour the 10 minute thing we respect it but we want to make the point of 10 minutes time limits may be appropriate at the end of a meaningful consultation process they are not appropriate at the beginning of the process KeyBanc was on our points about that at all but I think we do have the right to raise the issue about Kiwibank because the author of your report that I think you 've rely on in terms of selling it assets obviously selling the assets their focus we just ask you not to do it we don 't believe people wanted we don 't think you have the mandate to do so our submission is purely confined to that but the Cameron report spoke against in recommending recommend the sale of key event for the creation of key back good since prevailed and the Labour Party who was the dominant coalition partner of course did come along with that I want to say that the key we make was our bank was a key election slogan for the alarm and if you 're looking for boats if that 's just the motivation then I 'd say that you know having our assets is a great thing for you to consider because it certainly worked for the Alliance people do want to only assets they do want ownership of their own property and they the camera reportedly concern about that says that the core business is to provide other counselors provide services rather than own assets for financial returns we say the Alliance is the core business of elected representatives is to serve the people that involves listening to them responding to the needs and be attentive to what they say protecting their interests the camera report says the main reason for the council retaining ownership of assets is to control them so the complete can pursue objectives that may not maximize the value but provides non-financial benefits again we say the core business of the council is too soon to people to guard their assets and to be good stewards of them Cameron says or ask can counsel objectives in retaining ownership of assets we met through regulation or policy and seers in relation to various options for changing asset ownership while meeting council strategic objective says council can achieve or strategic aims through contractual arrangements and we say what of the TPPA does counsel or more to the point does the authors of the Cameron report know the secret terms of the ordered by an investor state tribunal by the New Zealand overseas if an overseas provider can 't compete favorably for council services in Christchurch because of council quote Cameron regulation or policy we 've got a six million dollar gift so cool to a Saudi businessman at the moment maybe the council might be having to a gift to some overseas in vista if we have policies or regulations that don 't suit them I doubt whether the present Saudi thing as a gift but anyhow providing services through public providing public services through as quote from Cameron contractual arrangements could well apply to central government for example the health services could be provided through contractual arrangements well I think both the major parties in the last few decades have sort of thought about that possibility but it isn 't a very good idea because people don 't want it there are deeper analysis of the reports khoa I ask you to support them color as the keep our assets Association I 'd ask you to respect them as a voice a legitimate voice of the people that have got 're going to hear them later in the week people are disillusioned with politicians they don 't trust them I just think they 'll do whatever they want it 's a group like car and others that come and do take the effort to get some a semblance of community voice so I ask you to respect them we say we adopt their points and their analyses I think the council should have an answer to the question is have asset sales soul selling assets work before and government central or or local we are well aware of the Douglas plan to sell off the assets of our country than the 80s three-quarters of the assets were sold to get rid of debt wind three-quarters of the assets were sold our debt doubled so I 'd ask the council what is so special about the City Council essence that 's going to alter the result of that for us what budget plan have you got to replace the income from assets sold is it a good time to sell for example the little comport coal prices dropping I 'm not much a bracket I 'm not only columnist I used to be a policeman you know I rested people for selling people 's other people 's assets in Turkey in Turkey there was a minister that got locked up for it the New Zealand we haven 't even been charged someone but India alternatives there 's got to be alternatives you 're in a better position than we are we support the others I think you might see Dennis later in the week from the spray tan neighborhood network there are ears we thank those counselors here who have got a common-sense plan we don 't want the sale of any assets but we 're grateful that you 've taken a stand in that regard but you know just some of the possibilities you know the government promised we talked about this cool cheering agreement you know is it been on it has it been on it we 've got very unique you need legislation in New Zealand probably in the world the Sierra legislation I 've read that as a lawyer I 'm a lawyer by trade you know CEO of Sarah could actually compel people to actually come together to discuss and come to an agreement about neighboring properties its extensive legislation the whole purpose of it is for the recovery of Canterbury could not the council maybe your legal advisers will be able to tell you this you know is there something in there that that cost sharing agreement could be relooked at that could be honored that because the purpose of that legislation we 've only got it for a short term but it 's very purpose is the recovery of Christchurch the insurance covers are they fully paid out are they honored whose fault was it that things like that to look at the rate increases we 've been through those I mean I think a lot of people would probably rather some who can 't afford would pay increases rather than sell this is some innovation the ideas keep our assets bond so I know you 've got legislature for strengths and borrowing you know I realized that but maybe the people to some people in crisis it would be prepared to lend some commercial rates rather than have their assets old create new commercial activities where belongs dial I see counselor there wanting to put the initiative with a container city great you know you want the new inner city build up we 've got shopping malls right throughout the city I rate a submission myself it 's gone and nowhere I don 't think and that 's fine but I suggested maybe the council we could ever our mall in the city our mall and be could be owned and controlled by the council commercial activity but the small business people in Christchurch you want and you want people in the city have it an hour more don 't pee ghorbanat rinse the overseas landlords a over in the city in suburban malls things like that delay i heard the manufacturing man sitting here said it 's a rainy day today I say to you delay there 's not a hot there 's not a harmful thing learn from nature autumn and winter they 're not there forever spring and summer always fire this is not a good time I said I and go mr. counselors there is an economist no doubt they come and go so do the seasons bad times come and go don 't sell off at a bad time people 's choice have they got things done a choice have they been given it to us have they fairly even given a choice we say in conclusion those who made them thank you for that honor your pledge I 'm sure you will be stewards and servants be attentive to what the people are saying and working the people 's best interest do not be afraid to stand against the pressure to sell assets kia kar thank you thank you it 's some 10 minutes so I don 't think we tied it pretty well yeah we 're respecting the time you are very good worship thank you very much you didn 't call me madam mayor I like very nice one z that 's what is he yep thank you very much correct tis and now _"

    "text": "my name is john kerr i 'm here on behalf of the rail and maritime transport unions national office and also on behalf of our little tempore sub a little import branch i see that i 've been allocated time for both of our submissions you 'll be relieved to hear that i don 't intend to take up the full amount of time nor do I intend to talk to you about bus stops and car parks I 'm here to talk about a matter that is quite literally one of life and death for our members some of whom sat behind me and have come to support their union in making our submission and that is around proposed asset sales and the prospect of the privatization of our port our experience as a union has been that this sort of sell-off is disastrous from the perspective of the health and safety of our members and in particular our experience in rail during the 1990s was a very very saddle on between 1995 and 2000 as privatisation occurred in rail health and safety became less and less of a decisions that were taken and the result was that there were 11 deaths in that period of rail workers and we only really started to turn that around after the ministerial inquiry in two thousand and the eventual re nationalization of rail in the port sector the most private port in New Zealand is the Port of Tauranga and by any one of a number of measures at the Port of Tauranga has the worst health and safety record in New Zealand we 're not saying that littleton ports management couldn 't do better we 're not saying that our port couldn 't be run more efficiently we 're not saying that we couldn 't we can 't make productivity gains we 're not saying that it can 't be run more profitably our unions just come out of a major dispute where one of the key bones of contention was a refusal by management to engage with us on matters like productivity we 've concluded that dispute and relate the relationship between the union 's at LPC and management on a different footing we 'd like to think and urging you and we 're pleading with you as councillors not to sell off the port our submissions cover off some of our objections to asset sales in general those are philosophical objections that is reasoning behind those I think that my colleagues from unions cantabria of canvas that those arguments and I don 't propose to rehearse them here the message that I wanted to give to you as a council today from our union is that this is a matter of life and death for our members we will campaign against any sell-off of the port and we are a campaigning union we are a union that prides itself on our ability to get the message to the public we don 't think that has been sufficient consultation or sufficient democratic engagement around the issue of asset sales and we strongly urge the council to forgo that option naturally the question would then arise what do you what else do you do again I think that other submitters of I 've covered off that ground clearly it 's it 's a difficult question it 's a complex question from the employees and manufacturers much of which I agreed with accept the conclusion so I 'm sure that you know that 's that 's something that we really do have to pull and put our minds together but from the perspective of our members our concern is health and safety on the waterfront I brought a couple of copies of a book that Union published last year and abroad this is a gift you madam map and also for the chair of the Finance Committee so i 'll leave that there and that just outlines the event in rail in that period that I 've spoken to thank you you haven 't_''_307.71 been warned about calling me made a mirror obviously but anyway um I just so I want to kind of start off with because I 'm surprised I hadn 't realized that port of Tara I had a worse health and safety record than our own little tempore and so I would like to have some detail on that sure because I thought that you would be making a submission about about how better does it little good and it 's at a very unhappy history and but port of tauranga and there 's a number of ways which you can measure port safety beef one of the thigh and Port of Tauranga I 've had people die too one other thing is it doesn 't get reported against Port of Tauranga because what they 've done is that have contracted out stevedore in and marshalling and things like that so often the deaths and injuries don 't come up as against Port of Tauranga they say we 're just a landlord would just clip in the ticket and and you may well remember there was an interview on mon and report last November with the corporate affairs manager which has gone down in Radio New Zealanders they do that disaster into the aware and that particular car prefers manager tried to abdicate responsibility for health and safety on the water from that 's the sort of thing that happens when you privatize pause okay so will I look forward to receiving that information the issue that we have at the moment and I guess what we moment is what 's happened between Tauranga and tomorrow so we may end up in a situation where the asset that the people of Christchurch own will diminish in value unless we look to other parts of New Zealand in terms of our own port so what we do need is a national port strategy and that 's not something that this forum is going to be in a position to implement I mean it 's quite clear that in a country of four and a half million people with the 11 blue water ports that something has to give and the industry is restructuring itself and littleton port management admitted that they were caught with their pants down by the the port of tauranga deal that 's not to say don 't know they were approached by port of Tehran fees um I 'll contraire the finance manager at LPC met with us and stated quite clearly it was the Silver Fern farms fonterra deal that caught them out ya know this up and they 'll established the grounds for they were serum they approached by port of tirana of tauranga was was talking to Fonterra so that 's what caught them out look we 're not saying that littleton port can 't_''_487.71 be managed better we 're not saying it doesn 't face challenges we 're not saying that it 's got all sorts of issues that need addressing however and it is still and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a major gateway in and out of our region and management have taken some enlightened steps in looking at an inland port out at ralston which will give them some access to to a greater into land so it 's already a port of tauranga one just opposite just that correct yeah it 's really you know I mean all I 'm saying is that the one thing that I think we 're going to also have to take into account as whether we 're going to have an asset of the value that it is today in the future and that is an element of a conversation that I think we do need to have yea ok Danny but obviously some of us are the consultation document the council 's seeking permission to sell off everything under have sinned yeah I 'm 32 a little bit yeah so you know I guess a worst-case scenario free for your Union in terms of the submission if we needed to raise capital through asset sales 0 bottom line you would have in terms of the port you know sixty-six percent 75% 51% in terms of strategic ownership I think once you start to sell any portion of it you you put your foot on a very very slippery slope and we 'd be very reluctant to accede to the sale of any any part of the port even though we bought some of it big yeah well we applauded that he said well done keep it we brought it back for a reason o neill s you made the comment that a national port surgery wasn 't probably part of this process but given that the number of submitters are raising with us the relationship with central government and seeking a renegotiation of the cost share this seems to me an incredibly sensible suggestion in terms should be proactive as a council and raising with government is that yeah we don 't ask that I mean we think it makes sense for ratepayers because we 've looked around the country for ratepayers around the country and also for New Zealand business and for New Zealand workers that we have a national port strategy I mean historically any major info structure in news even has been put there by the state you only got a look at the history of 19 19th century New Zealand to see that the only reason that Christchurch City Council owns the porters because there are two in the region tara has owned 56% buyers region Paul I thought it was so you could get a return on the investment no no it was because it was in the region at the region 's would took over the ports yeah blunt yep yeah they did the region 's took over the port they couldn 't give the port of little turn to Canterbury Regional Council sorry because there was another one on tomorrow so they distribute him to the council so that the port of blood or something I 'm sorry I thought that was the reason why it came to on the port I thought the reason why it still owns the port is that it provides a return on capital at nine my questions around I 'm not saying we don 't need a year a new zealand wide strategy to rationalize the amount of ports we have that move right up and down the country the question is if you do a aerosolization of the ports and little Dan Porter 's deemed to be the one that is rationalized out of the freight movement that would decimate the value of that port so that 's it 's a risk what would you say to that offense what came out of a restful ization on sports I think if I think that we kind of get in ahead of ourselves and our analysis is that littleton given its position in relationship to the major economic center in Canterbury it 's very difficult to make a case to rationalize littleton out of any national port strategy okay thank you very much 'll leave those there yeah no no that would be great thank you and thank you for making me and rape special in your life _"

    "text": "okay ora my name is karina brown i 'm the convener of union 's canspiry apologies from paul watson who was meant to be here but he 's had an ills in the family so couldn 't attend so um linda boyd has stepped in in the last moment to fill his shoes big shoes that they are to fill so initially what we 're going to do is we 'll go through the overhead slide protection we 'll just actually talk to it um you are able to read it you read it extent of submission and then we 'll go for questions after that okay so unions canterbury is a regional organization constituted within the new zealand council of trade unions to waikaimahi that represents approximately 50 000 people working in the private and public sector workplaces in the canterbury region now a key point in our submission that we 'd like to highlight is that the council needs to lead a campaign to re-open renegotiations with the crown on the cost share agreement with a view to establishing a priority list of government and council projects based christchurch so just to elaborate that on a little bit further we you know aware that the cost share agreement was signed off by the previous council with no public consultation so we 'd like to see this renegotiation renegotiated in the issues that are raised by christchurch citizens through a consultation process addressed during that renegotiation um yeah and so we 'd also like to see the extent of the projects in terms of how many in the scale and the timing for us we know that currently we 're running behind schedule and that it 's a very full schedule that 's actually in the lttp for the next 10 years and we think that that 's a very good time now to actually look at that and see okay you 've got more of idea now over the last three or four years how long some of these projects actually take and that we should actually be looking at looking at that re-timing because it 's a full program in 10 years and i don 't believe what 's in that program will be complete in the be costed in the 10 years because it 's not actually completed that time my understanding is you 're already about 450 million behind project timing um and so that should actually should we really look at the whole process should be re-looked at um and a view of actually keeping the assets because we don 't believe that you necessarily have to sell the assets with the plan looking in july for things that still haven 't actually yet been done and looking at um the other issue for us is that especially around the um insurance all that there 's a lot of things in there that the money isn 't available though the money isn 't in the plan money is going to come in so we really believe there needs to be a whole look at the consideration around how um we look at the projects that are going ahead um and we put in there as an example what happened in wellington the 1990s because there was a big issue there we had one one that was privatized which was the electricity and one that in how the approach has been with the maintenance and all that has been immense especially since the electricity is now in its third or fourth owner in that time so even though strategically started off as a partnership and they 're more and more of it sold off until now it 's completely privatised and it 's in the same same owners as the um some of the ones who run the ports and all that and their main concern is profit not people and as orion was quite clearly stated you know the climate ryan cheer stated he felt that we could do more because we were a community owned council organization that actually gave the people people actually really believed in the community and believed in it to go forward so it 's forgotten to raise those couple of issues okay so any proposal by the christchurch city council to sell any any significant assets fully or partially shouldn 't occur unless full public disclosure occurs and christchurch citizens have full opportunity to debate and make representations on these proposals so assets of the city have kept to the people of christchurch unions canterbury endorses the people 's choice common sense plan as a preferred viable and sensible alternative to options presented to date in the christchurch city council 's long-term plan um yep so as we mentioned before we really believe we need to have a review of the whole final financial assumptions um and it should really focus on retaining management ownership and control of its assets we differ quite considerably from the last ones that actually presented and said we have to sell it for assets we firmly believe we do not we believe they are a very strong public good and that we believe in the long term that any sale off of our assets is actually going to have a major impact on our rates and it is actually going to be and as rates we all know affects those of our lower income the hardest and it 's going to become really difficult for those people in those lower areas we 've already got excessive rents we 've already got um and those got costs that people are finding it difficult our assets that bring in such a good income 230 million over 10 years that money is going to have to come from somewhere yes we 're not actually going to have you know we 're going to cut down the amount of money we have to borrow but in the end of the day we 're going to end up losing assets that are actually ours for strategic partnerships littleton was a prime example of what was almost going to be a strategic partnership and that organisation would have actually used us as a feeder for another organ for the other um ports and it would not have been the best interest in christchurch and i disagree that actually being part partially selling some of our assets will enable us to become good feeders for other organisations using queenstown as an example about the ccec did i disagree with completely and actually um if we could do that then our best idea would us to buy into a queenstown airport rather than sell off some of our own if that seemed because we in our own right should be a feeder to auckland um and i think that we have to look at a way that we actually can best retain our assets and i think that requires a full financial assumption review um and that we need to actually be very careful if we look at things that are actually going to sell off what we as a community currently own and what she was christian certain councillors have been elected to actually look after not necessarily to sell off um but we want to appreciate and think the opportunity to speak here today and we are now happy to take any questions you might have of us sorry i 'll start with the orion one because um the obviously the focus there is um incredibly helpful because i tend to agree that um with the submission that you make that the risk that you put around to and private hands is that they may be there to asset strip they might be there to really do nothing and just claim that rate of return that it generates because as you say it 's regulated so there 's but the resilience of the organization and yes you can put it in a contract but the problem obviously is at that point if they don 't deliver it 's too late the power 's off so and i do worry about wellington with respect to the advice that you 've given in that regard and i really appreciate the submission but we don 't own a hundred percent of orion at the moment eleven percent is owned by the seoul and district council they also are dependent on the um question of uh brazilians so what what on earth would be the issue about selling some shares to the existing shareholder i suppose for instance like for for your example for sale in district council because orion is a canterbury organisation to me that 's like community or ownership is based in salman district council and christchurch city council because that 's the catchment area of orion and so it 's it 's still to me that it 's still a hundred percent council owned because it 's a hundred council owned but not necessarily just by this council no objection to selling shares in orion to another council in our region who use orion and our region and if it was actually still the fact that yeah as long as they 're in our catchment area but what i have an issue with is when we sign selling it when you strategic partners you look at the h h group or look at one another we didn 't we didn 't we didn 't look outside our region for so on uh for orion no we didn 't that 's what we looked at but i mean obviously obviously the detail is going to come back to it but i just i wanted to kind of compliment you on the work that you 've done on the resilience question because i think the public won 't have taken that into account and it 's a very valuable piece of information but what i wanted to explore was whether it was an absolute ban on on selling or whether it was slightly more open than that and you 've given me the answer to that question um ref thanks have been very tangible social and economic benefits from council ownership of strategic assets yep would you be able to explain some of the social benefits of owning the airport and the port so yeah for well for the poor we 'll leave that to our colleagues following up behind us that 's rail and maritime will actually answer quite in depth about the social thing about the port but the airport the reality is it is the gateway for our people to be able to go out and it actually i mean if you look at some of the other ones we actually have a very beautiful airport and if you go to other airports you don 't actually see that there 's a pride and ownership and a social well-being and that there 's actually a view that because it 's council owned that we can actually look at ensuring that the social well-bearings of people actually receive reasonable rates of pay there is a real encouragement to actually work with unions because city council was a very good organisation and understands the importance of partnership with the it um and so there 's a real belief ensuring that the well-being of the employees is there the well-being of the people actually in christchurch able to use that to actually a facility that they can actually have pride in an ownership of the sausage well-being that know that that they 're not something have to go out there one day and suddenly everything 's tripled or quadrupled because some other owner has decided that they 're not getting a great rate of return and they 've looked around the country when i was at 32 for an overnight and a nice covered car park is enough and you get 64 in auckland so we 'll make it 70 without having an accountability because then you can actually say excuse me you know you 're actually you 're a councillor owned operation it 's a benefit between what 's affordable and and what 's actually makes it accessible for people to use and it gives it a view for people to actually be able to go there to pick up people i love the way you have the new actually quite unique i travel a lot around new zealand and it 's very difficult in wellington and definitely in auckland to actually get that kind of service to be dropped off and picked up without actually paying money and i like the fact that they 've learned to occur um and i think they are the sign of social well-beings we have by owning that airport and by the fact that the cost coming back from the money we do make from that actually comes back into the coffers in dividends so it keeps our rates low and that is the social well-being and enables money to be invested in social housing and other such things whereas if we sold off that sold off the airport even so that we had no longer operational and reduce the dividends and that wouldn 't be there anymore and so that 's where we see that social well-being yeah we don 't actually invest money in social housing from dividends but so you 're saying that can only only happen under council ownership yes i believe it can because the reality unless going to start charging them for that behavior then yes because i think you once you lose the council ownership of it then the reality is you have no control on what they do and don 't and in the end of the day they have to become profitable for their shareholders whereas you 're accountable to the actual christchurch city people they become accountable for their shareholders which is a completely different kettle of fish and then it becomes profit not people okay some strategic partners might start out being that way and i know that you have a belief that you know they forget strategic partners that are actually have the same same ethos that it was going to be well but at the end of the day you 've got no guarantee at the end what happened what happened to that strategic partner and at least with this christian city council were wholly owning it then you actually know that the city council we don 't wholly own we 're not holding i mean you 're always here now yeah yeah so as majority but i 'm yeah and and we don 't make those decisions either but i 'm thicky thank you i noticed that you said that you were supporting the pla at the program put forward by the people 's choice yes um which includes cutting cycleway expenditure from the plan by 30 million which of the uh which would be one or two cycleways of the network which ones are you not intending to do that would be part of why as i said our review we 're not saying any specific one we 're saying that the overall we need to review which can be done in this 10-year plan we 're not saying they 're going to be cutting out completely we 're just saying in this 10 years that we should know that what can or can 't_''_830.959 be done and the reality is i as i believe what the people choice of theaters the reality is the amount of work that being done it 's not all going to get done anyway and i agree with that i think looking at how the overruns we had on the fury start getting into them take a lot longer so are you so what i 'm saying is we take away the take the money out 30 million dollars the money out because at the end of the day it 's not actually going to be as you 're not going to get it all done in that 10-year plan are you just delaying the capital expenditure absolutely it 's delaying but the plan actually says trimming it like taking it out it 's true yes it 's trimming it from this 10-year plan it 's not trimming it from the next 10-year plan yeah the trouble the trouble is is that we 've got a 30-year infrastructure plan that goes with it this time i think a lot of people haven 't quite caught up with the fact that we 've got a new model where we are required to take into account the 30-year infrastructure requirements of the city when we set our team exactly and i know that they can push out costs for later on and and i accept that because i think in 10 years but can 't just push out all of the costs until after that we 're not asking you to you know we 've been asking you to push out all of them that 's why we 're saying we 're trimming them now and i still think we can do that because the reality is okay you can put them all in this 10-year plan so what happens then so in the next 10 years when only three quarters of it got done now it 's another 25 then it 's going to actually reduce what 's to happen in the next 10 years is that what you 're going to how it 's going to work or is it going to push out even further i suppose that 's what my concern is is when we have a 10-year plan when we have a plan that isn 't that achievable yeah how you know yes it might be part of a part of a 30-year plan but what 's it going to mean in the next 20 and the next 15 10 to 20 years or 20 to 30 years you reduce what you 're going to what you said you 're going to do in the 20th and 30th year i think it 's part of why we want to revisit some of our delivery mechanisms but anyway absolutely um that 's the time up for for for the submission so look thank you very much um karina good to see you as always and um we 'll certainly be following up on all of those issues but thank you very much for your submission it was very good um could we have the rail and maritime transport union i know people want to offer their support but i would really just appreciate some not having that from the background please _"

    "text": "hi hello welcome thank you let 's do psych language yes Peter cycling New Zealand manufacturers and Exporters Association I 'm not going to cover off what we 've already put in our very very brief plan I just wanted to really give you a bit of a helicopter view on on what our positioners and I 'll start very briefly with who is the manufacturing you know the enzian MEA or New Zealand manufacturing and exports Association and what do we represent and I 'll just give you some some very brief headline figures Manufacturing is twelve percent of all jobs and Canterbury and in Canterbury alone is thirty-four thousand employees representing 3.1 billion dollars with a turnover now of course not all of that sand Canterbury but a big chunk is okay and the average wage in the manufacturing and exporting arena is actually significantly higher than another industry sectors a higher skill set etc and for every one job in manufacturing there 's probably another two to five jobs downstream from it we 're talking about the corner dairy the supermarket at cafe etc etc so it employee inside the community and and if we look at say New Zealand there 's a whole it 's about a six billion dollar industry so it 's not chicken feed and what I 'd like to really talk about is what is happening to our sector we as a sector are not benchmark against domestic costs we 're benchmarked against international prices and we 've all heard of different economies have different cost structures there 's nothing we can do about we have over the years seeing increased costs of our organized inside our organizations we 've seen also reduced revenues as a result of the exchange rate and these companies have survived through this by becoming more and more efficient but I venture to suggest to you that we are at the tail end of being able to rein in those efficiently there aren 't that many more to be had and if we look back at the City Council over the years and I 'm talking about from when the first four ships came there was a big industrial focus a big manufacturing focus you take the has grown it 's logical that this increased pressure on all of those areas what we are not seeing and I 'm not sure that we have all of the answers here is we 're seeing increased pressure on the areas that we would normally help you occupy so residents want to get closer to or move into those industrial areas and what our concern is from as far as the council is concerned is that those manufacturers who are inside the City Council boundaries have choices the choices are five kilometers down the road to the Selwyn District Council or overseas and if I look through the draft plan here and I don 't know if anybody has done that if you search for the word manufacturing and the plan you won 't find it if you search for the word industry in the plan you will see it twice one of which is a discussion about industrial waste so we believe there is not sufficient focus in the plan focusing on our particular sector which is manufacturing and industry the second point I 'd raised here is that about rates increase that for us is simply another cost which we have to absorb we would love to be in a position where we can force our customers to take a twenty or thirty percent increase in cost or price we simply cannot there is no room for us to increase our prices in fact the reality is that they are reducing not increasing now you could argue that we should move our operations outside of New Zealand valid call however there is going to leave a substantial number of people without work because of the significant number of people who are employed in our sector and I 'll just summarize that in another few ways to say that for our society to be in balance everybody needs to be entitled to work or to earn a living not everybody will be a rocket scientists or a cafe manager there will be all different types nationalities skill sets and mental abilities inside a balanced Society we offer a broad range of employment opportunities for those people in our sector and our greatest concern is that we will lose some of the fundamental issues around industry and manufacturing I would also please one whatsoever the last point of view is that if this budget or plan was presented to any one of our members board of directors it would be rejected the balance sheet is simply not strong enough to sustain all of the aspirational things that everybody wants to achieve we fully support as an organisation the partial if not the complete sell of assets that 's not because we operate in that sector it is simply a business case that says how can we afford to do all of these things these assets were put in place we 've been told for meant for decades for a rainy day we have a rainy day thank you I 'm Paul thank you for us we come along with spigner so they look you may have two sexy answer the question I was going to ask before like hit me help early around rate rises and you talked that as has been another impact another cost it in a zone you have no control of in fact your costs actually so from asset sales is there anything else you identified through our plan that we could reduce or change or what if I to keep the rates at an affordable level for businesses I look I don 't_''_463.23 I don 't think there 's any silver bullet here there 's there is cost everywhere I think what is from from our side is about general efficiencies we have had to reduce our costs of running a business by between twenty and thirty percent is the ax twenty to thirty percent more efficiency gain to be had inside the council operation I would venture to suggest there is I have seen some of the activities that go on and I have to say in a manufacturing on an industrial setting that would not be acceptable Andrew thank you for your submission this afternoon I 'm just looking at some bottom of page two in the top of page three of your submission there you talk about facilities that could be deferred or or planned out what what type of facilities are you thinking of there or what examples would you give what we 're talking about here is we fully support what the council wants to do what we 're saying is that needs to probably be some logic if you take for instance let 's take an example of the convention center we 're not we 're not full fully privy to what the full contract or engagement as with the central government over there nor a word if it was alone if it was in the private sector that would be a planned activity stage one let 's build to this point let 's see if it 's big enough at large enough it can do the job with an option to go to stage two with stage three it is no different from an enterprise buying the land but building a building in stages it might be better to use an example that were actually contributing to an a in a very direct way an hour ltp so that there isn 't one of them so perhaps if you use the Nitro like the Metro sports facility would be a good buy just we 're talking generalities I rather because I know that how things get reported and it 's easier if you actually report on you know that you actually use the example of one that we actually have on our LTP so the convention center isn 't one of those the Metro sports facility is one of those and it 's very amenable to the point that you 'd make so would you like to repeat that I 'm not sure there 's any more that you need to add apart from the fact that if some of these things can 't_''_621.589 be afforded you 've got two choices you either don 't build them or you take a different approach which says we 're going to take a planned approach here and do this in multiple six so you could stage it so you could focus on say the swimming pool first and then you could focus on the netball courts or there or them maybe the other way around you know that you could create is no different from building a house there 's no point in designing a house that you think you for the second story in stage one right it has to be well thought out will project managed but that is a way of reducing expenditure on day one and also spreading spreading load over a period of time I mean that 's really helpful thank you Andrew but there was your done right um Yanni first off can I just acknowledge your support under bullet point for for local manufacturing via explicit local procurement policy and I mean obviously this councils working around concern of the trans-pacific partnership so I presumed you 'd be in support of our position on on that I think I think the thing could we have we think about charity starts at home I think it 's probably sums the whole thing up um you know I have to say with some dismay that even one of your own organizations just recently missed out on a tender doesn 't make logical sense to me so i think that the statement charity starts at home still rings true and also i mean you may not be a weaver now the skirt NZTA projects are part not going around to other countries but i 'm just a final question from me was um yeah in some ways in your submission it seems a little bit of a contradiction because you 're saying sell offer assets that make money that raising come and bring in income raise revenue and and then the don 't put rates up and I guess we 're just interested in your thought over the medium to long term if we sell off the things that bring in may to invest in things that lose money like Metro sports or the stadium then we 're not on a very sustainable financial position it would seem to me that the rates would go up even further than what we have and you 're composing concern at that so as we keep the rates low while selling off the things that bring in money well each entity would have to be that each entity will have an enterprise value I 'm not privy to what the enterprise value would be and each entity will have a return on investment now that whole case needs to 're getting a four percent return on an investment and borrowing money at seven percent that makes no sense to us the second thing is that if you do not sell some of those items off the balance sheet and you do want to go ahead with all of the initiatives that have been put forward then you will have to borrow heavily and there are some key assumptions in there that Christchurch City Council will grow if it becomes too expensive to operate an especially an hour setback it won 't be grown from here it will be growing elsewhere so I think that 's on a case-by-case basis but the bottom line of it is that every organization would our organization for instance would love to buy the latest of everything but we can 't afford it we have to either stage it we have to sell something off to trade it off against something else a rates increase in the order that you 're talking about from our industry sector it is not achievable there are other ways of doing it we believe thank you very much know the I 've got to catch up on some time but thank you very much for that unions Canterbury _"

    "text": "thank you much around thank you very much for the opportunity to present today on the draft long-term plan from Christchurch City Council new brighton sits in a very unique position at the moment it 's very exciting we 've got the ability right now to go against the grain of 30 years of social and economic decline this is an opportunity that came about lightly there 's been extensive work being enabled in the last few years to get to this point the long-term plan has significant impacts on you bright and it 's it 's a ten-year framework or where we see the coastal areas going ahead Christchurch is a coastal city and New Brighton sets on 24 kilometres of Coast and preparing the submission plan to provide the Christchurch City Council of intelligent thoughtful commentary on its future financial commitments to New Brighton with a specific focus on the redevelopment of the new brain and central business district and irritation for sure i 'll try and brush over this really quickly because i 'm the standard on time limitations can i get a quick indication of how summary of our submission we looked at a stage development process for New Brighton there isn 't a single project that 's going to come out of the LTP that 'll where move New Brighton ahead what we are looking for is a framework of public expenditure year by year that allows us a framework for private industry to develop and partner into apparently the budget allocation for new Brian in the long-term plan is insufficient to enable the council 's master plan this is a document that 's been working on for three years now and the budget just simply isn 't there to be able to do public space actions please bear in mind these are any public space actions and private industry is our role as the business of landowners to ensure that that moves ahead progressively worth the public body we seek budget confirmation to implement the council 's master plan from stage development focusing on 2015 budget confirmation for aesthetics and amenity enhancement it only takes a site visit to New Brighton to see the current state of New Brighton as well cracked and dirty amenity values are very very low it 's not only the public body private industry has to play its part also 2016-17 the RM avenue extension is currently a budget allocated for the purchase of the holdings but not for the building of the road that provides no certainty for private industry partners to develop adjacent to those new roading infrastructures 2016-17 the bus interchange through the master plan there was very good bus interchange system proposed for Beresford Street one hundred and four thousand dollars for new bus shelters is quite far apart from what 's being proposed and the plan as well bearing in mind that new brighton is a key activity center for land use recovery plan also 2017-18 shared spacing Marine Parade this is a natural progression after the RMA of extension you create a new north-south tangible for New Brighton run an east-west and also attracts the business district out of the flood zone 2018-19 redevelopment of the pedestrian mall if anybody 's been to Rotorua recently the eat Street concept up there which was a public space action has worked incredibly well to partner 1819 as it gives us lead in time to work the commercial properties adjacent to that public space also 2017 to 2020 the introduction of the Legacy Project than the redesign of the foreshore inclusive of boardwalk systems linking the north and south ramps together and ensuring that there is linkages back to the commercial area as well the pier when it was first built has been a government review as to why that didn 't work as a catalyst for private industry development and it was approached in isolation their project 2016 2020 general streetscape upgrades New Brighton and has suffered 30 years of social and economic decline as I 've indicated earlier and there 's a lot of public spaces that are very very low an amenity very currently we seek the Christchurch City Council knowledge is new brightens place to character Bertie Center and it shows that the budget allowance for the suburb reflects the visions of both the community business and residential certainly of investment and you Brian will provide a framework for private industry confidence and investment I 'm very excited to hear about the I 'm even more excited that you 're going to be targeting you brighton is one of the areas for the development authority to move into my one hesitation is that you 've got the community business and residential which very much shares of vision in new brighton there 's been a lot of hard work a lot of community meetings held over the last two years to ensure that that vision is united on the side of that obviously came out the master plan the long-term plan without putting in a framework of budgetary expenditure you 're going to have a development authority come out and it 's going to have a legacy project to work on and that 's almost it we need to have some certainty from public space actions as to where you brightens future lies we 've put a lot of leg work into this in the last two years I 've had san martin and jason mill working with us quite extensively looking at the role of the public spaces one of the most exciting parts that we have been looking at is that not asking you to invest in a single project we 're not asking you to lose money the arm Avenue example is classically the development contribution fees and the extra rates ribbon you 're over a period start mitigating some of the costs of these public space actions but through the long-term body through the long-term plan the public body should provide confidence and a framework of public expenditure to progressively move New Brighton ahead confidence after all does breed investment implementing the council the ad master plan claim to be achieved for the budget confirmation of the long-term plan this is something we consistently hear from staff when we talk about the aesthetics and amenities or the enablement of the plan is that it is merely aspirational until we start seeing budget confirmation around this like docomo questions oh sorry driver this toy I thought you were gonna go to another slide and I consider it on for a lil I but it might soak up too much time look let 's let 's start with the the probably that obvious which is that probably maybe four thousand maybe vicinity of New Brighton and when you don 't have people living somewhere then your doctor can 't stay your dentist can 't_''_419.6 stay your pharmacy can 't stay you know like so undermining the services and a key activity center without addressing the residents who are going to be living there I mean where does this come unto the thinking in terms of what we can do around the future of New Brighton it 's absolutely huge similar to the days of Saturday trading when there was a loss of the monopoly over trade the residential loss and the potential future residential loss is obviously a major major component to the communal district in New Brighton we need to change tangent a part of new bronze always going to be a service-based area for the local catchment area at the moment got 16 and a half thousand residents bumped up to 24,000 if you extend that catchment a weber the future and you Brian must accommodate things such as tourism that we 've got to multi-layer there but they don 't go to the doctor they don 't go core critical you know sort of community infrastructure and beaded in that environment I mean I understand the doctors gone so I mean you know we 'll go I don 't know yeah after the nearing the point the point that I 'm making is is that unless you 've got core critical mass in terms of people who live there then you can 't replace it with tourists no obviously not no we still have a negative catchment in New Brighton there 's still 16 and a half thousand residents within our catchment zone so we haven 't lost all of our residents we 've lost a portion of them and I understand that there 's been a doctor closure really the doctor there is there stay near the pharmacy that is there is staying there better attraction of some of the banking services over time as well but we need to continually adapt and change this we 're introducing extra residential into the commercial district as well so we 've got the apartment complex which is in resource consent currently that 's another fifty two apartments into New commercial district which will underhand some of those core services but we can 't fight against the red Sonia decisions with a loss of catchment we understand that it 's not fighting against that 's just how do you I mean it yeah it 's a question of fact during a turn but no I I mean I thought I don 't think there 's anyone around the table that doesn 't agree that this is an area an important area of our city that needs a special focus ref thanks I was out in new brighton last week meeting the the pools team and yeah i was couldn 't believe the state of the place really oh i was i was stunned having said that i do think there 's a tremendous opportunity there and i can see I 'm very confident we will be able to deliver the legacy pool what I 'm quite keen to do is actually make sure we do everything at the same time in a planned way and I think the development Christchurch will be able to do that so you know we pool and playground area and there 's a bit of money on budget for that I think a few years out so we need to sort of pull that in the Orem Avenue shift and basic pedestrian izing that front piece is that won 't budget to buy the property but not to build a road from my understanding okay so we need to do that but I think the key thing is to do all of this wrap top together yeah in the wrong place and I think guess I just want to make sure that the community is on board with acts obviously I 've been speaking to John and Ellen so they were part of that same process so I 'm already speaking to potential investors and owners of that pool so I think with the support of the community we can start to get on with them and this is something we 've been talking quite extensively about its not looking at Virgil project New Brighton as a whole the approaching TM and that 's absolutely what we 've put forward with this stage development but single steep in there that 's coming out of left field that doesn 't yield and that bigger picture either I think the one other bit I think you need it is mentioned in here and that 's transport so we you know we need a decent buzz service capozzi going from the library into town the new ballad owner waters have differently decimated with the capability of the area and alongside that we need a cycle way it goes from the central city to marine parade I don 't know what the direction is for that yeah there 's two different views on that I 'm obviously the cycling that we 're going through the Avon to me that for the residential red zone areas to me that 's not a commuting link that 's that 's very much tourism focused our pages road there 's a direct link up there so the budget allowance could be there to make sure that there is appropriate site and it works through all right yep yani think you mentioned the pier was reviewed by government about lack of economic investment and hey are you aware of any other research that 's happened in terms of obviously the new library and huge amounts of money council spent on changing the roading previously listen to why those heaven it 's reasonably can tell me why the legend and we 've had a lot of conversations around this part of it as engagement of private industry eighty percent of the commercial district isn 't owned by council it 's private industry that 's my job to ensure that there 's progressive movement on that front that 's the biggest change in you brightened come from private industry the pier and library review i 'll definitely seem that through to you as soon as i find out but if it is but what are those isolated actions easy you 've got a peer and library built and it 's a one-off you 've got a slow road built and it 's a one-off at the moment the aesthetics and amenity the street cleaning the toilet all of these things have been let go so you 're expecting one project affects it the same as the only Stimpson stages yeah the business association used to be cousins hire somebody that who basically did you know that the cleanup at the mall so dominated that two weeks ago again as well ryan seeds are there and i 'm not sure who who funded that whether the council under there but I mean effects something that the business association i mean we heard the previous submission from the central city and basically they 're saying look at the end of the day we 'd like to be a business improvement district we 'd like to be self rated and we 'd be able to provide our own sort of you know sort of coordination and service delivery and i think that brighton would be ideal for their approach as well absolutely unemployment agreed we 've been told that the livers of sewers have not changed in new brighton post-earthquake they are getting the same lives of service as per our contract yeah and it 's assuming that it was good before and given that my office was out there at the time I can confirm what Paul 's but but it actually got into that state when the when the Business Association stopped hiring now and as soon as that guy left off the terrible that I can 't remember his name is Liz as soon as Liz left the standard fell dramatically now what Paul 's done and I kind of want to put this on the record as that poor is the first person who 's actually brought together the businesses and the landowners because they 're not the same people and note the Business Association prior to a pool coming on board with the business and landowners association never talked to each other and you couldn 't get the multiple owners into a room at one time and look I just want to kind of say all credit to Paul I know that the there 's a lot of disappointment in relation to the ltp I guess and many respects that wasn 't it wasn 't our intention we 've certainly received your submission you 'll sort saw it than a number of councillors have actually seen your video presentation and and I know that mirror in the chair I wasn 't here for that but I thought I heard that it was interesting and and in that the message has been received and well understood and we 're going to be looking for ways of making this work I 'm going to have to and I know that I 've kind of sidetracked but Tim but thinking Paul we talked historically about Saturday trading we 've got seven day trading now we 've got a team machines because it used to be the only place on a set of Emmett banks are open you have the most beautiful library I think with the most beautiful view we put all that the people have you brightened work very hard to get up here I mean we didn 't see huge numbers flocking to that so with regards to New Brighton being a destination place now we can do over the time there have been a number of variants with regards to closing roads open road slow traffic bits and pieces different types of playgrounds but one of the things that I haven 't heard is you able to kind of get together if you look like say a dress smart on steroids or something like that you know like because I think I don 't think that that 's fitted oh no no but the point that the point that I think because we really do need to kind of end it there but it 's not a question of the of yeah New Brighton looking for a proposition there are thousands of people who go to the pier can I just call you jump right throughout and that the problem is they don 't cross the road so is that the pier has been an attraction there is no question about there but people don 't cross the road and cumin two new bras I 'll quickly jump on that as well just for two seconds please the pair by itself works as an entity brilliantly it doesn 't do the job of the retail cool our role is much much deeper than merely looking at the public expenditure property amalgamation future use of holdings eccentric cetera new Brian 's never had as many we are doing is progressively working through those different property ownership titles ensuring that positive investment moves into the village that it 's under pendant by the right retail and hospitality offerings as well so this isn 't starting at point zero we started two years ago that was point zero for us so the events calendar over the last summer was gianormous and we feed off the back of their there 's been retrofitted buildings already occurring and a progression businesses that are moving ahead that 's all part of that stage development we need a run in time as well if we land at all of us in one year it wouldn 't work we need time to introduce positive retail and hospitality to the area yeah but there are a range of issues that need to be taken into account and I think that will be working with you quite closely on this because as you say it doesn 't all have to be delivered on year one but there does have to be a strategic series of steps that are taken to really create new brighton alert to be so thank you very much for doing it very good right New Zealand manufacturers and Exporters Association _"

    "text": "wonderful thank you very much madam mayor and councillors for the opportunity to speak to our submission on the draft long term plan i 'm joined today by a member of our executive committee tim Diaz Lee who 's general manager of the ibis hotel and Lisa Goodman who is the CCB aid manager during the sea CBA 's existence of 80 years we have had a very positive constructive relationship the city councilor that start we look forward to continue to work with you to ensure the economic viability of the new central city we appreciate that tough financial decisions need to be made for this long-term plan and agree with the comments made by the temporary Chamber of Commerce that there needs to be a significant emphasis on strategic thinking long-term benefits must be weighed up against short term savings given the level in this and pen by both the council Ciera and the Central City a significant part about submission focuses on car party and because we 've only got ten minutes we just honest talk to you on that we appreciate them in the past six to concerns raised by City Central City businesses and looking at solutions we note that the original adopt from the central crusher central parking plan which correctly notes that increased certainty about the current availability and future provision of party in Central City is important for providing confidence in the rebuild of a thriving central city we couldn 't agree more with that statement it reflects our set concerns outlined in paragraph 23 of our submission certainly around parking is critical for central city 0 moment viability not just in the future but right now we know this from hard data and in total feedback that we 've had and Tim talk to us about hotel experience that met were dad thank you so the ibis hotel has been open since for timber 2012 so we 've been open for two years and seven months and in that time we 've had over a hundred and seventy thousand people stay in the hotel which is quite a lot of people to be right in the heart of the CBD we have a total of 22 car parks that we have park next to the hotel and over that period of time we 've sold 16,000 car parks so if you think about the number of people staying in a room that 's approximately fifteen percent of everybody that stay every room we sell a car park to well it 's in our top three of comments from all guests about the lack of parking in the city and that 's now that 's not in the future when we 've got the justice precinct with I understand no car parking available with the building across the road from us opening later this year with again no parking for any visitors so it is a major concern for us moving forward not just our hotel but all of the hospitality in this long-term parking Antony thank you very much Tim I 'm leases doesn 't give us some feedback from ccba members that she 's willing to talk to well I just wanted to add part of my role is to walk around the central city and talk to our our members the the businesses who are and then our and have a conversation there are always two key issues that are very important one is access and there is a recognition that that is difficult at the moment was the need for the continuing infrastructural repairs but the second issue is car parking it is always car parking particularly so the first feedback is from our retail and hospitality members they receive feedback from their customers who are try to come into town and your car parking can 't quite often because workers in the city have taken whatever available Patsy are early in the day and also feedback from those same businesses that they also find it difficult for their own business needs in terms of finding adequate car parking so we 're constantly receiving this this feedback and that 's something we wanted to stress today thank you very much Lisa so momentum around playing for short a long term car parking both temporary and permanent must continue to be a high priority for council car parking is an example of needing to weigh up long-term benefits I don 't short term savings that I referred to earlier the process underway with the private sector to explore permanent parking simply the council shall be reviewing is spinach Iran car parking as an investment bringing a financial return providing social as well as economic benefit is that would ensure more people would come to the central city before the earthquake the council used to earn 11 million dollars profit from jar party it is a money-making is to size for council third point greater attention also needs to be paid to exploring low-cost short-term solutions as detailed in paragraph 25 of our submission fourth point we would also want to highlight the proposal in paragraph 29 of our submission for some incentive in the short term for people come to the central city to shop to play or to do business a period where the first hour of council off street parking is free wood in our view be a great start so our final point on this issue is that we look forward to grated carrot to the financial details outlined in the draft l TPS capital program for car party we continue where team to continue where of mere encounters this is an exciting time for the central city despite the bloom that can often be reported by the media commercial momentum is returning our members are essentially the pioneers they have the faith in the city in a sighted by its future many are small independently owned businesses without any corporate backing the council can help Brent help them to survive and thrive by ensuring that good infrastructure and measures to alleviate the impacts of the rebuild are in place while the central city has been rebuilt around them thank you thank you very much um Paul thank you for your submission that just want to ask one question it 's around parking you talked about to us working with other parties do you think it 's important or I must have the council owns all the facilities or do you think that some of these parking facilities could be provided by the private sector I don 't think matters of hope whether they 're owned by the Chancellor private sector the important thing is to provide to our party I think it 's an opportunity don 't didn 't matters council does not be doing another major cities there 's plenty of car parking buildings owned by private investors and they 're extremely happy or Thea returns well there are in other parts of the country as well that 's right I mean I 've but I 've been up to what 's that shopping mall up and Auckland where you get your first two hours free as long as you produce the ticket from one of the retailer 's to Wilson 's parking so I mean they they control it up there yani thank you yeah really thank you for your submission on the central city car parking I 'm a welcome effect you 've said it as a strategic asset I 'm just trying to understand so if it 's a strategic asset and it 's bringing in why wouldn 't you want counsel to retain it and have it so that it helped us with a financial situation I mean I can 't quite understand it doesn 't matter of a week private or public if it 's money that we have is the sense of having a thing done by the private sector as opposed to us I would love the chancel to build the tower parking that we 've been five years and there 's not one public car park building being started in the central city we can 't_''_551.52 wait any longer we realized is a shortage of cash of capital and we 're providing a solution suggesting a solution just like the chamber of commerce de just before we think there is an opportunity there for you to have outside providers you 're short and capital would you like it or not just like I personally am short of capital and the terrace project and I 've had to sell some of that off in order to be able to finish it council needs to be doing the same thing our Phil Thank You term referred to concern about time for people to parking places for people staying in the hotel and I guess that sort of referred to as longer two more long-stay parking I 'm just wondering what what from the simples from your perspective do availability with shortage of short state parking or won 't or a longer stay for commuters I just wondering what both really the short-term parking and the long-term parking in terms of overnight people can work and well together for example before the earthquake the hotel guests would be able to park in a public park or privately owned park overnight which didn 't interfere with the long-term parking during the daytime or short-term did you have arrangements you know I 'm I was going to ask you the same question yep but but worth worth with our car park buildings yes certainly what was close to you the closest one to us was actually in the Grand Chancellor so it wasn 't ideal I urge to mccredle with the Wilsons park and the grandchild you know a bit but with the council are with the council yeah litchfield Street people could park there during the day not not overnight though no is he that says that could they we would have been happy to have end of the council was to have a parking building reasonably close we 'd arrangements that you had for overnight car Penguins will let the primacy but we would be very willing to have that kind of arrangement with council yeah I would comment that it 's the short-term meet that is really concerning the retailers in town long term if you don 't provide them you read this situation victoria street where they now lead off a space because they haven 't provided parts for their office our motors I mean the thing is is that oh and it 's a huger challenging area but it does relate to the the the ccrp the central city recovery plan which doesn 't require long-term parks with buildings anymore so that there are issues and fell and then that will be the last it was a recent council report it was a short stay parking that was that raised the highest concern too so just wondering if this is a case we affect your association should have further discussions with the council staff to especially resolve this the Sun short stage issue but it may indeed be exacerbated you know by the lack of short but I mean there 's been parking loss from the private as well as the polar area much so yeah we 've got a number of challenging issues but look that the submission is crystal clear it 's been heard we we have got obviously arrangements and with the crossing so that there will be car parking provided but that as part of a an agreement with the council and obviously we 've got our our what do you call it expression of interest that we head out the RFP that that will be coming back to Council anytime now soon so we will be considering this matter as a as a priority so very much thanks very much now if we could go to another very important part of the city 's to you brighten and if we could have the you brighten business and landowners association _"

    "text": "it explained the importance of movement in our city movement of people movement of freight movement of air movement of light movement of water and movement of noise the holistic approach to the rebuild of the city is absolutely fundamental and involves spaces and places finally we 'd like to comment on the need for our city to have an aspiration what do we really want Christchurch to be what do we want Christchurch to do what do we want Christchurch to stand for how does that fit in with an aspiration for our region Canterbury and we are the interdependencies the interdependencies between the aspiration of our region and the aspiration of our city it 's a compelling proposition and we need to make sure we get that right and when it 's Christchurch fit in in terms of its role in the way to South Island and its role with New Zealand and in its role internationally really important considerations in the context of the LTP we need to better define what we aspire to do so that we can become the most attractive and livable city in to live The Canterbury employers Chamber of Commerce is committed to assist the Quad City Council to returning to delivering the highest possible levels of service to its people our community and you can be assured of our support and the squeezed so those are my opening remarks and I 'm very happy to take any questions on the written submission madam ji thank you i was going to start with the with the libraries one because I to read the the coverage of your submission and then read your submission and I felt that they were two different things so the way that I read up was that it it didn 't it didn 't it wasn 't necessary for the council to be the owner of assets and then I know that there was a letter to the editor which made the point that the eastgate library or the Lynwood library is now hosted by the east gate mall and the council doesn 't own the eastgate mall and actually the feedback that we 've had from a lot of our users of that library services that they I really would like to that so I 'm glad that you 've highlighted it but I kind of wanted a double highlighter because it takes away from the importance of the rest of your submission as end which is focused in my view on your point around the risks associated with something that says sweating the assets that actually means deferring repairs to core infrastructure and I really want to kind of explore around the the risks that are associated with that and what that might mean for the local business community that you represent yeah we share your concern exactly and we are unashamedly emphasizing the sale of assets to realize capital which can benefit the entire community as well as a positioning those assets strategically so that we don 't have to sweat assets so that we don 't have to have unsustainable rate increases it 's a time to make that consideration and we understand that the the City Council has a real challenge on its hands to persuade the community at large that that is the right thing to do and from my perspective and employees Chamber of Commerce we want to help where we can to make sure that people do understand that that is a proposition that we need to consider in the context of one the long-term interests of our city and to the fact that we have very little alternative and with with the question of of I mean you talked about strategic Equity Partners and in terms of some of those assets so so you 're not seeing that just as a straight-out sale to anyone or a fire sale approach you 're actually talking about looking for some sort of strategic alliance can you can export it as a super short game as solving your problem and it 's eminently solvable a financial short you 've got an enormous balance sheet the long game is how we position those essays to make Christchurch more internationally significant in other words introduce equity patterns into the port or the airport or anything else you might be considering to sell that adds more value than just the equity for example you might be able to introduce a strategic partner that can add even better than they do you might be able to reduce a partner that provides connectivity with other parts of the world through those assets so that we protect the utilization I 'm very very conscious of the fact that the Port of Tauranga has invested in the port of tomorrow and that they 're using the port of tumor as a feeder into the port of Tehran and we 're sitting with our port in isolation in between I 'm very conscious of the fact that Auckland Airport has invested into Queenstown airport and there are now more trans-tasman flights at peak going into queens down then there are coming in to Christchurch we need to think long term about how we position our assets so that they benefit our community long-term so are you saying that there 's actually potentially some risks by not looking for strategic alliances that might infect diminish the value of the asset over time to the to the city and the region absolutely absolutely that 's exactly what we 're saying and we would be saying that earthquake or no earthquake but we whammy if you like to resolve our financial problems and to add real value to this city 's s its long-term okay there any other questions of people and Pauline thanks Peter I 'm just on your own submission page 10.6 the extra capital was made available you suggest the heck 's we bring forward some of the anchor projects not just wandering hidden any specific projects that you think would be oh yeah at the moment we 're sort of looking at delays and those anchor projects and and we need to get them back on track as much as we can I I think that it 's really disappointing to see continuous delay we have a little priority list of assets and I don 't to go through them today but happy to talk about that in detail later on the important thing is the choices the council can make if it gets more money for it from its asset sales than it then it requires to address its immediate problem and those are some critical choices that you as counselors will have to make and and they happen well if you want my priorities I 'm really pleased with the way the justice precinct is developing and it 's going to happen the bus exchanges as a very integral in that process because of the land the temporary exchange is currently on so that 's a no brainer next we 're looking I would be looking at the health precinct and saying we need to really make sure that we get that health precinct operating efficiently because they don 't affects our community welfare it impacts our economy and and impacts a significant part of what we 're doing in the context of a 1.4 billion dollar Canterbury health budget and all the ensuing benefits that can be gained from that the the Metro sports facility had be good to see that advanced and I mean we would have to say that down eldest is the is the sports stadium because there are other priorities in our community that need to be addressed we want to see that the memorial finished we want to see the river continued to be developed I like the river precinct must must be accessible along it 's a it 's hot conduit and will be a beautiful part of the redevelopment of our city so every every redevelopment has has benefits in its time frames and we all want it to happen immediately it 's not going to have it immediately or see it face ring yeah yani um thank you yeah I was interested in your thoughts around the library have you seen our detailed business case that Deloitte stood over the library and seen the proposal that summers are the one that you 're recommending what that would do in terms of cost to the city I 'm privy to the fact that if the council could borrow more money it is the the best proposition for the counselors to our own its own libraries the council is not in a position to borrow more money at the moment so and that would that would again reinforce that if you want to make decisions about retaining some of those core assets such as library buildings and there 's no reason why you shouldn 't if you have the ability to think hard about selling assets because then you can realize the cash that which in a position where you can finance some of those other things you want to finance and not have to make those hard decisions yeah I guess if I read through what you 're proposing it 's my understanding that that will effectively increase rates it puts to get a large degree of uncertainty as to the rink costs and we 're also funding a developer 's profit margin so you 're talking about library to library if we have a private developer builder and release it so since all you 're saying you 're hugely make it very clear all we were saying and we were using the library as an example look at favor and that 's okay but all we were saying was that the council doesn 't need to own all that 's hard core assets if it has to make some really hard choices in terms of where it 's going to get the cash from to funders future it doesn 't have to own everything so that was the marginal benefit if the council can borrow at rates that the private sector kind and own its own assets that 's great but you 're not in that situation so this some calls you 're going to have to make here in terms of do we sell assets do we have to own all the property we are do we have to own all the buildings we own or are there other ways that we can work as we 've said right at the start at work in the interests of this community long term to get the best possible levels of service from the council through to its community are there other ways of the proteins I appreciate that and just that one that yeah thanks video i just want but a clarification about any example say cost and benefit analysis we are from self a major library i don 't mean this of everyone 's a city in a city has you know use the formula that you 've outlined and on a command species 's any can study showing the success or otherwise I 'm a comparative with with low visitor publicly owned I don 't know why you 're getting distracted into the service offering of the library we 're not we 're not even suggesting that you look at can I speak we 're not even suggesting at the service offering be compromised in any way at all what we were suggesting was that if you haven 't acid could be a library it could be a community center could be a town or could be anything if it comes down to a choice of having that service or not having that service because you can 't afford to own the asset that stone and you don 't need to only asset to provide the service what 's your decision going to be yeah I don 't know but I think that I think that the question was asked and answered by Councillor johansson and I in each the answer asked and answered when I put the question it wasn 't it yeah I mean I 'm not going to speak for those less as you said there are much much bigger things we need one line that says that the council doesn 't need to own all of its assets yeah yeah I know so are there any other issues I 'm germane to questions regarding to the ACA sales because you particular emphasize theory the reputation to sell ASIS can million achieve the community outcome sh 0 you mentioned a fiber healthy Liverpool enry no benefit to the city my questions the first ones we got into the definition of the strategic assets even reveal the local government act the strategic aces is aces their council needs to return to achieve all to promote important outcome for the community so my questions if you sell assets you are not capable is it how to achieve this community outcome well you don 't need to sell the entire as it so you can still maintain control of the acid you just don 't need to have all of your equity in it that 's one one way of doing it there are assets the council loans in highly regulated areas which are completely regulated which the council could sell without losing any of that when I came to the city the council had just sold its repertoire and it 's abattoir the proceeds of the effort were used to fund the Canterbury Development Corporation 's beginnings so who would suggest today that the council should own effort was things change things move on and we don 't have to own all of the assets that could provide services to our community thank you secondly second question second question regarding your timing or you infra set to sell ASIS but a moment steer some of the factories uncertainty for instance a moment we got into a capital profit council steer is still undertaking to reveal all those the capital province maybe summer program is now the urgent can be deferred even some rapport grand populates important can be the kind of the cancer is rachel and also regarding to the Toronto his fortune stare underground some informations then I Erika malt and also they got into the and coastal sharing agreement the council with the central government as well as insurance etc all those the factor now year you know the tubular certainty so why yeah the the thing that we find really concerning about this ltp is that there are so many uncertainties there are so many unknowns in terms of insurance or in terms of the cost sharing agreement or in terms of the costs of developing future capital assets whatever it might be none of those are playing into the council 's hands and my assessment every one of those is going to bite you rather than stroke you it 's going to be more expensive than you thought least expensive so and we 've said in our submission that the council has no regal room even in the context of this plan it has no wriggle room so we need to be working very quickly to assess the options to realize capital to make sure that you don 't get caught and and to make sure that we are working as a council in the long-term interests of our community there is no time to waste and there is but there is also they need to make sure that if we do go down the asset sale route that is done possible outcome in terms of the sale of V of whatever part of the Essex you decide to sell in positions those assets to benefit the community long-term I kind of wanted to pick up another part of your submission because you talked about transformational opportunities as picking up on language that we used in the consultation document around regenerating and redeveloping the residential red zone creating a world-class network of cycleways and shifting transport off options but also restoring the Avon and Heathcott rivers so these are these are kind of the transformational things that we 've kind of put on the table but you 've added to that the opportunity to create multiple new commercial delivery vehicles that could work and partnership with the private sector and I presume central government as well to develop precincts you know and I really liked that idea because it it moves away from the idea that an anchor projects it 's an isolation and it also moves away from the idea that central city as somehow separate from the rest of the city and and so that was one the second cannot be enabled there through the recovery plan and the third was the support of the introduction of new technologies to improve asset management management the end demand forecasting the sensor technology and of course sensing city was was was enormous in that regard so I just think that you know I really kind of wanted to say thank you but did you want to speak to any of those justjust only what I said in my introduction that we 're talking about spaces and places and that 's in the spaces are our whole city and how that all fits in together and also the opportunity I mean we have we have opportunity here now to do what needs to be done in a way that has never been done before in a way that we could never have even dreamt of in the past all of the tragedy of these events aside we have enormous opportunity that opportunity is in our hands it 's not in anyone else 's hands and if we screw it up it 's our fault no one else 's so from my perspective that we optimize those opportunities and that we do ensure that we have a city that just just can 't_''_1081.11 be matched anywhere else in the world when we reach the next few stages of our journey thank you well thank you i think that 's an extremely positive note to end on thank you very much to all the trouble that you 've gone to to put the submission together and thank you for your offer of supporting the city as we work through all of these challenging issues thank you very much good luck with the girls a lot or whatever in a submission to go through thank you oh yeah and I should say that the the live streaming came on during that submission so you 'll be able to reflect on that but I will comment on the live streaming because this is the first time that we 've had an LTP and Christchurch where the submissions are live streamed and so I think that 's an extremely positive advanced in terms of democracy and accountability and I 'd like to acknowledge johansson who I know this live streaming on online but what it also enables us to do is that if individual counselors can 't_''_1144.92 be present for any part of the submissions it does mean that they can play it back and and actually catch up on all of the submissions and I have an undertaking from all of the counselors that they are willing to do that obviously there are some people who for whatever reason will have to be absent for for small periods of time and and that that certainly I think should be a great comfort to people so it could I now invite the Central City Business Association to come forward _"

    "text": "definitions do I have a seconder for definition perry Jones I 'll put them on it was Community Corrections beg your pardon community correction in terms of the declarations of community activities to occur in residential zone didn 't weeks didn 't we fix that last Friday we did for the central city but not for the remaining know what the context that we discussed last week was in relation to the stage two definitions you but it didn 't apply in this chapter did it I mean we know that all you are looking at now are the definitions that are specific to the theatre stationary stage three different safety three chapters so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now we 've got coastal environment and natural hazards okay let 's do the amendments to stage two chapters including just relook at their amendments can I just take out the word stage two chapters but because we 're simply adding to them and men months to include rules relating to natural and cultural heritage stage 3 into chapter yep cool relating to natural and cultural heritage stage three and to the following chapters yep okay I 'll move there seconded by Phil Clearwater i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carriage and now we 've got coastal environment and natural hazards utilities and energy and the mover and seconder both accept that as part of the motion thank you so where are we up to with coastal environment and natural hazards have we got the Met crash the system try to print them right okay the URI I wanted to hit race and just want to ensure it because it is included as it I didn 't see it with the illusion that this is really coastal hazards it was really the specifics for resource consent applications and who would undertake would do those assessments and as I said although its listeners chatham professional engineers I asked that in fact they is the people who could do there could be white that 's all any is no other than that if I can respond to that um got it here I can provide if you like but we 've redrafted it so it 's really focusing on a coastal scientist and assessment by coastal scientist and should there be a need for hard engineering works then input from coastal engineers look that that will cover make a broad as as I have requested thank you okay all right so they 're nice just to go back to your first question sorry I couldn 't couldn 't put my finger on their policy it 's it 's actually in the first part of natural hazards so has already been notified and its policy five point two point six which reads protect natural features which assists and avoiding or reducing the effects of natural has such as natural bonding areas coastal dunes wetlands waterways margins and riparian vegetation from an appropriate subdivision and development and where appropriate restore maintain and enhance the functioning of these features thank you right so is there any any discussion on the coastal environment chapter yani when I my biggest concern is that we 've got intensive housing proposed in our in our coastal were kind of that 's why those Mets are so critical because like in the Lynwood area understanding what the government have done in terms of rezoning that also the hearings panel have done in terms of rezoning that land to be intensive if they have so that 's a coastal environment yeah yeah actually what 's really interesting very good is this comes in through them what this is that 's the extension of a coastal inundation area to which is the same as the flood fill a little floor level until they were level install fishing one that was the strongest one and the practice of it is that 's true there 's some fingers of of coastal inundation area one and we went we went back and looked at those when when you raise those council you 're handsome and what Bailey what the consenting framework would do would enable development if those coastal inundation issues could be addressed through engineering works along the side of the river there so they 're coming up through through the river so that 's a title pressure up through the is raising us as perfectly right which is that if there is to be substantial what 's weird intensification of residential and their area when the risks weren 't met at the time that that decision was made then it 's an issue so how do we draw to the minister 's attention for example that our these mex now identify heightened groups that require substantial word to address in terms of the earlier decision which was to allow intensification in that area that 's the question that I 'm not sure about what works would be required to address it so the making of these will draw that that hasn 't to the attention of any developer and then they will need to look at how they can be addressed yes but we wouldn 't recommend as a matter of course intensification and areas that are exposed to natural hazards unless those can be satisfactorily dealt with yes I know but you wouldn 't want intensification and areas that are exposed to natural hazards as a matter of course if you 've got options you wouldn 't choose them about 39 if you wanted to have a look at it on the it 's right it 's right at the page is that what you 're referring to counselor yeah I mean that 's the area and I mean then I think it raises the question in terms of residential zoning actually why would you even allow like l3 or l2 actually maybe you should just retain our one of these areas well we already here it 's already covered by the flood and full level management areas so it doesn 't make any difference with the with the title I mean with the coastal inundation if they had this a nun day those mechs are the same up yes it 's correct yeah so the the remedy and both instances yani is the same and they 're the same areas but I mean that the trouble was is that we 've got houses in these areas and they 're not that this is not the only area that are being repaired they 're not being rebuilt and they cannot protect themselves with new floor levels that 's that the trouble with it has been the trouble since sun as simply says summer since the plan change of well 48 was made operative that 's that highlighted what was always going to be a problem which was those that were rebuilding would be able to protect themselves and those that weren 't would not yeah i mean i just again maybe it 's a super prices but i do think in terms of maybe we do it through the submission but it does seem to me that we do need to think about the land use the brazilian that coastal permutation area one so just remind me again what the rules are for that then you 're definitely well that 's the area that 's subject to coastal inundation during storm events in the next 50 years and so we 've taken a very restrictive approach in terms of new subdivision to create vacant lots in new buildings can effectively non-complying activity status right now that the other messages that you know these are the year this is what it will happen if we don 't do anything yeah counselors have spoken to the government about this that we 're preparing a natural hazard strategy a resilient strategy and also to the rent land drainage program we 're looking at means to address these issues in the future widget the region 's taken up a leadership role on the natural hazards as well and it may be that they will be able to provide us with some additional support and advice and certainly they 've provided us with a lot of support was the coastal hazards assessment come considerable and using their own data they 've collected over two years yeah and Glenn thank you i denounce a question about the floor levels which are proposed to increase to 12.3 and whether for those who have houses consented below that whether that means that a hazard those could be potentially placed this is a concern of it okay so chill so the days of notices under the building it rather than under the Resource Management Act and the it 's a case by case assessment that would have to be but a hazard notices only only placed on building hundred flutters over 400 millimeters and it impedes the egress from that building so that 's a case-by-case analysis of each cake of each building it doesn 't necessarily follow that if your floor is below the floor level and fill management area that you 'll get a heads of notice that does not follow alright and the concern is obviously about insurability and the bank 's approach but it 's situational it 's not a a situational that 's right thank you and it sits under the building each rather than the resource management need right thanks yeah I think that it is going to need to be some sort of awareness campaign I mean you 're talking about huge areas of some huge areas of red clothes that have got this now non-complying activity for for development which is quite significant change but it 's like I 'm just wondering if this give you like a nuclear bomb on those communities and whether they 've got any idea around around this as i said the the area concerned is no different from the existing floor level in phil when a flood management areas I wish you 'd called them FMA still but anyway if you 're male amazed if him L if yes flac cma you know you had a our level and Phil management area floor level and Phil management areas fiction and you would have build a house on it or you want to do a repair because your house was demolished in the earthquake you have to apply for a non-complying concede when you build for a new build sorry buildings yeah you have to then what would if you 're replacing an ordering that was already there used to got existing use fights yes yes fry so you build a new floor level but for a new for a new bill which I mean okay maybe does not mean even made it his son what 's the kind of what do they have to show in terms of being able to build on the coastal inundation area when you haven 't met us for discretionary and restricted discretionary but for those non-complying activities we don 't have those assessment meters because we suggest that 're rebuilding would be permissible and this of course they 've got some hazard mitigation proposal either for the site or for a number of sites that can help to mitigate that risk right to take every class what they just say well you 've got the seawall so therefore you 're okay or I 'm just trying to understand what it means to these people because if you look at this map that it really is extensive and it fits a lot of people of course a lot of those areas already have a sea wall there right and particularly at sumner but that 's why the road exists the effectively without being eroded so as I see it earlier to some extent that 's going to put the pressure back on the council to look at these net the various strategies as to what it 's going to do including its operational work as to you know maintenance and upgrading of existing facilities like the sea walls that are they all ready yeah and windows someone 's existing user ID 65 12 months after non-continuous use so i 's another 12 months well months where they can still make application so frequently anyone that 's got a house here doesn 't need to worry they just get existing use right certificate and as long as they fill to the highly or ears or mitigations another way and they need to be consumed this is why we 're mapping us we need to be concerned for the future and philly future investments just as a council has to be you also we 've got this information we 're required by national and regional policy statements to met net to net a coastal hazards identify them and manage them for the next 100 years so I understand that and I think it 's good that we 're doing us I guess it seems to me like we 've met and we said this is really you know important thing to take account of but most people can just get existing you certificates and carry on no no Yanni this has been that issue since the earthquakes you know I mean I you know I just you know that the feeling only thing that 's good about it is that feels good when you stop you know and I mean this has been raised over and over and over again that we have a huge challenge in the city managing for not just the you know threat of coastal inundation but but actually just the the flood risk I mean lluvia pluvial I don 't know I can 't remember all the words that we 've learnt but the thing the thing is is that if you are rebuilding you can protect your floor levels if you are not you can 't_''_951.78 and this is the real challenge for our city and you know it 's one that we 've got to think about how we can best utilize our resources as a city to to offer a greater level of area-wide protection so this is hugely challenging because it 's not just done that 's not just somewhere it 's not just you know as you can see from the maps its extensive but what I take some comfort from is that the coastal inundation Mets are no different from fill management or whatever floor level and fill management areas are the same I should just add one proviso to that so the coastal inundation areas out on banks from you so no the coat yes so they weren 't metaphor that 's right so they add for level controls em series on being splints Allah that have not existed Kevin existed before and that will be an issue and they will be informed and just so I 'm clear just got a clarification just the mapping assumes no current protection so the beach ball and sumner all that sorry in real clothes or the summer yes Bernard Rock protection the patient is Ben 's none of that so they are it is no it is acknowledged in terms of the coastal erosion some right so for the places like someone where they have the revetment but of course that doesn 't protect them from inundation because they 've got the culverts that allow water to drain out and of course the sea water can come into those you know and in the storm events so they 're not to 's pretty clear though that term you know these years are contagious and just sort of just referring to what yarny raised around how in fact people obtain this information like just again I reiterate starting with us as counselors the new the present at the new presentation is going to come to us so it 'll give us some clarity about all these things and then the other part two is like we need to develop a plan about like a common spin and effect but also how we have these discussions with people in the affected areas so in fact you know that the information is raised with them and me our knees are alluding to their so okay I think it 's really about prioritizing what areas we might sort of start with and we was getting that information sheet rewritten because I may know it really has to be it has to be factual but not but not also frightened people I mean this is not this is not something that people can 't_''_1105.23 you know can do nothing about you know like it 's that add to our protections or you know change how we develop particular areas and look at the tell we used an information sheet and taught in heaven in discussions with the individual property does not that the long-term plan has actually provided us with dead opportunity so there have been a number of submissions that have come in on infrastructure and you know some people saying you know to fear this that and the other others saying you know get on with it and so it I 'm working up a proposal that next Friday so not this friday but next friday we have all of the infrastructure submissions on the day but we start the day with a presentation on similar to the one that 's being organized for the foot for the air cannon and counselors and i 'm also thinking that the e can and counselors one should be opened up to a wider group of people so you know maybe you know representatives of the summer residents association representatives from south shore and things like that you know try and get a wider group of people because it 's all very well for councillors and commissioners to be well informed it 's actually really important that we start a public conversation which is a hard conversation to have but the truth is is that we 're a city built in a low-lying environment and we 've been made more low-lying by by the sequence of earthquakes that we experience so it 's going to be an extremely challenging time for people and there 's a lot of well as i 've said on many occasions when there is a vacuum there will always be information made available to fill up some of it is more accurate than others and i want really accurate quality information and the public arena so that people can understand what the challenges the threats and indeed the opportunities are from from all of those but anyway so do yes yonni we need to think oh sorry look David it wasn 't it Stan I apologize now look we acknowledge that it 's a fairly contentious issue and whole lots of variables but I 'm going to remain consistent to my convictions chapters purely on the basis of the fact that most of it is based on computer modeling and I 'm yet to see the model the verification of the values that have been inputted the margins of error and on that basis i 'm not entirely convinced that we 're on the right track so that 's my position and i 'll be staying with it at this stage yep so yani i say i mean i think the other point that we discussed before was you know if we 're building parks or recreational facilities in these areas and say to people need not suitable cos and time it 's going to have coastal inundation then it you know be it 's kind of hard for the public sometimes understand that inconsistency so I mean you know I just I do worry I do think we need to work through a really clear communication engagement plan sip I mean obviously we want people making submissions on this we want them engaged I mean interesting enough at some last night we had about 300 people in the school hall about get engaged on very specific local issues sometimes these bigger issues just maybe they 're so back that people don 't quite remember eating the significance until they come in the planning document and then they go oh my god how did that happen so I think you know if we can through the submission process organize that those positions so that people can be informed and also think about what it means for us as a council for our activities and these areas because you know if I look at this straight we 've just spent all this money building a new pumping station and it 's Anna coastal inundation zone so why would you do that to me it doesn 't seem very logical so okay I mean you let 's let 's get this out I do things information we need to address and you know I think it is important that we signal that we are looking at it yeah at this stage that the this is a reference to them to the ministers I think that you know we have various obligations in this area this has communicated the advice that we are able to govern a support we 're able to give to our residents as they grapple with the issues that that they have to grapple with I mean there is no there is no alternative to grappling with us you know it 's I think King Canute stood there and commanded the tide to return to winter came but he wasn 't successful either so and we we have we have had you know we 've got significant challenges as a city because we 've got to work out what is the infrastructure you know what is the natural response what is the what is a engineered response you know and what are the best solutions what a cost-effective what you know what could we do as a city so all of these questions are being asked and the long-term plan process as well so in a way there 's a bit of a disconnect but the fact that this is now you know provided to us I think that 'll give us a very good basis for understanding what it is plan because it 's significant there is there is there 's no two ways about it individuals can protect themselves and we 've decided that it 's the floor level or the fill level that can that can determine that level of individual protection but what can we do as a city to protect ourselves and live without with our natural hazards in a way that as you know affordable on one level but also effective on the other so it 's a huge challenge but I that the way that we communicate thus and work with our communities will be instrumental and and and how they are able to respond and cope with with it but again I take great comfort from the fact that in the city area and the Christchurch City area as opposed to banks peninsula the flood maps for the city that have already been notified in stage one are the same as the coastal inundation maps so we 're talking about the same areas in the same response I do have concerns with people who are repairing in these areas because they don 't build to higher levels so so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no it 's a record David East and can we deal with natural and cultural heritage and the same way oh sorry natural hazards and the same way you 're sick on that and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no carry but David East opposed right so i think that is that our job done unless there is sorry and i think we did include a recommendation and they did we not for for the flatland recovery being taken out yeah we 've got we 've got the we 've got a separate resolution on that so go to the flatland think there is isn 't there yeah it 's got approved the chapter and section 32 for referral to the minister in two weeks that 's fine okay okay yes thinking I accept that lets no that 's been moved and seconded and it 's gonna be dealt with unto its right to say so it 's appreciated just need to know I oh you have got the two weeks here that 's yeah thank you okay all right so is this is this an agenda clearing thank you yes it 's completed these chapters about that flatland recovery zone will now go to the Manassas hopefully this friday and that doesn 't mean that we and that means we don 't need a meeting on Friday no I actually do have that won 't be here that 's one information to bring to you regards mediations on the transport and the temporary activities stage to this Friday all right well I won 't be here so i will let Jamie know but if he 's not here then yes that 's twelfth of may I think that she had ruled for now yes it only got settled yesterday so it may not be in your diaries yet I 'm can 't remember it only got settled yesterday the date but I think it 's in the afternoon oh I 'm escorting Prince Harry oh sorry who 's it yeah you 're all jealous I know um no place thank you very much _"

    "text": "rights and the people that have had a very poor offer and have actually lost everything I kept really unsettles me well um I mean I can just vote against it but I have I haven 't got a seconder so if so the question is this should should we do fear this resolution until the two weeks time and then we can n do have sir okay so we 'll defer the resolution but we 've got a mover and a seconder we 'll deal with that and and two weeks time all right and if we could do a little bit more work just well get some more legal understanding of the situation as well yeah I mean I think that that the trouble was is that there is this almost perception because of the language of red zone yes that it 's somehow dangerous uh nuts you know can 't_''_62.91 be built on I mean it 's nonsense it 's just exposed to the risk of liquefaction electrical spread its that 's dropped so the crust is not as strong as it once was the type of the buildings that were there before you know there 's all of these different issues but there is nothing to stop the building of residential properties in these areas but it does require substantial time effort work acceleration of the land you know all of those things need to happen and it needs to be done in a coordinated fashion which is the basis of the red zone offer and if the value of the sections had been higher then then the values they were prior to the prior to the decision being made the government used the 2007 rating valuation as a mechanism for easily you know pricing the value of the sections but actually they weren 't necessarily the value of each section they were you know that I mean yeah did you not know that I 'm out on that plane thing they seem that the two teen ones were judged to be lower but we don 't know their valuations were done but there was no peer review on those fibrillation yeah anyway so but I mean the thing is is that I mean if you right out of my area than to into the central city if you if you bought a house there and its rating valuation in 2007 was 280,000 or say 300,000 it wouldn 't be surprising that you 'd paid over 400,000 for the house because that was the market value of the whole property you know and and those were that they were losers as well so even though they got the full payout they 've been paid out on 2007 rating valuations when your house didn 't have to be rebuilt was devastating for people and so you know that those are the those are the sorts of issues that really did never got a public earring because it was always you know like that was it was really it was it was seen to be fear for everyone but actually the the fact that they were winners and losers came out much later and and the public discourse and you know I think we do need to stand up for the people who were on the losing side and they are largely the ones covered by the quake anyway so we 'll defer that to two weeks time and you 'll take some more legal advice and and come back to us yes around that as it ascends contaminated land yeah and just talk to the team that we 've got in place around the issues that have been identified and whether there 's a need for any extra consenting requirements just to ensure that we are in unit 4 toxic land in the future yes yep all right the next one is definitions we 've we 've signed that one off that was the one that we did with Fiona because it actually did relate to okay allow a minor amendments that 's the resolution which is just a catch-all for very minor things of numbering is wrong if there 's the odd spelling mistake if things are out of place it 's not content driven yes I 'll move that you do I have a seconder that Jimmy chin I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried sorry madam chair before we go back then to resolution that we 'd like to bring to your attention in addition to the one that you pass the other day yeah what say there 's a consequential series of amendments to that listing I 'll just say which papers on in here it 's on the lawyer one two three four so that the Heritage grouping of the former be so happened yet door be amended from high significance group one two significant group to to reflect the Heritage significant Oh significance of the limited listing I parts of starred in their aerial heritage met number 6 87 be amended to show only the cash on Colombo Street facades and miranda is the listed heritage item and to remove the identified setting and that the schedge will be amended to change the description of former beats department store casual and colombo street facades and remove setting from the description and remove the heritage setting number so I 'll move that and somebody will seek and it I know yannis going to oppose it so I can list that already Phil Clearwater seconded so ya know that it 's fine it 's more clarity yeah so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no and record Yanni johansson opposed right so now we go through the individual chapters because we see we 'd just go through them chapter by chapter we 've already done the central city one first thing this morning so have you got the list of the chapters or are they just enough yes no the list of the chapters I can tell you as the central city we 've done that natural hazards stage 3 which you 've done natural hazards yep the flatland recovery zone which taking out and I just asked about one part of a natural hazards love with yes your hair we signed all it off entirely and we 've been through it we went through ok yes and you did you went through it on friday with less effect recommendations I just haven 't seen the changes I think well we don 't always bring you the changes as long as we have the recommendations approved by you we make those changes to what been doing it yeah I think that what what came up on last week was that you know they were counselors who wanted to they wanted to go through each chapter and sign them off because if there were amendments that they wanted to put on the table then yes it could be dealt with in that matter because we have the chapters the amendments Elizabeth have you got them from the previous no no no no if council has had their own amendments that they wanted to write a table that 's right that was what today what is about that under so so what 's the order natural hazards flatland recovery print for base Sun cranford coastal environment natural hazards natural and cultural heritage and definitions and that 's it natural hazards natural and cultural heritage cranford Basin coastal environment we 've taken out the flatland recovery zone and definition right there is one will map I recall that you asked us to bring to you which would just it 's just coming through now it 's taken some time to develop where you asked for you us areas right and if you like you could wait for that or we can distribute that to you it 's just on its way now well we could we could go through let 's leave natural hazards and start off because we 're not doing flatland recovery zone until two weeks so let 's do cranford basin so the resolution and each case is that there is approval to go to the minister 's but there is their overarching resolution is that the overarching resolution is simply to approve all of these chapters and their section 32 reports yeah with the exception of the belly but I said last week that we would do it chapter by chase he said that there was a you know an ability no individual counselors to move amendments because I mean it 's true that we dealt with amendments last week but they were amendments that were promoted by staff yes they weren 't amendments that that individual counselors too so if you wanted to put in any further counsel amendments you could do it under the cranford basin yeah section yeah so so one but so cranford basin so I mean I i I 'm an unhappy pro forma just to move all of these recommendations from the chair and and then I 'll just call for a seconder for each one so so can you bring up the standard resolution right so that the stage 3 chapter and okay so if you basically I on why is that move seconded there because are you did that for cream for infant no no but what sinful City the the original one was for the smoke a so it was just for the central cities no no well we did ask for them to be sent through and we did ask if the if anyone had any so and I did specifically say that just query whether you did but we had to deal with it because the staff member was leaving so that 's that 's that 's too late for that so the way that I wanted is that it 's the overarching resolution but it 's for each chapter so a done central city kept chapter so if we could have going to do is take that resolution and turn it into a central city chapter resolution and a cranford basin coastal environment natural and cultural heritage and definitions and and then there is also just to bring to your just to bring to your attention again you 'll recall that there were some minor amendments made to stage two chapters like rural subdivision development public open space about matters that were referred to from the natural and cultural heritage chapter all they were was where there was a rule that linked to those chapters included back into those so what what what do we need to resolve and there and well that 's why had the the overall chapter as all all chapters and section 32 so you could put i can come i 'll let you know which chapters they are oh I mean what we could do is we could just do them as ABCD so you 've got your overarching resolution a central city be cranford base and see you know later would just do them yes I just wanted to have them an opportunity for people do is leave three as it is pass it as a whole but then go there go now through each of those headings that you have which are officers ones and add any further resolutions that the council councillors believe need to be there okay yes I know so it 's one of the reasons where I wanted them separated okay so so can we do it this way or as yes you can and I 'll just I 'll just put together the list for the ones that have input natural hazards at the bottom because we 're waiting for max to come yeah all right and it 's not a a snot cranford basis oh sorry can you just add on the central city and it 's already done so just move there yep sorry all right and I 'll Proform and move all of them all right so so cream for basin do I have a seconder for that David East so is there any discussion on it Yanni um I mean I can understand that we need to to get residential land zoned in areas where a floodplain and I mean it 's interesting to reflect that this will create a desired have infrastructure money spent on this area the kid all the other areas like surely that we were just talking about that is constrained that can 't intensify because it doesn 't have the infrastructure so you know I 'll support us going in for notification but I do think we need to think strategically about the idea of bring up all this land on the periphery or on the Greenfield that requires expensive infrastructure we 've got existing areas that we want to intensify that we 've got not sufficient infrastructure which is currently zoned for residential and I think you know I am concerned that without any clear prioritization process about where the infrastructure goes we just continually spread out the in terms of a city at a very unsustainable and unaffordable way so but I 'm happy to support this going for notification I think through whatever evidence or information we get back through our long-term plan I think we need to really have a good understanding about what infrastructure commitments I still feel that we are sending mixed signals through this planning process yeah well I agree with with that insofar as planning decisions and setting aside land for residential developments have got to be decisions that are taken and in conjunction with the constraints that sit on our infrastructure Honor I agree and tighter you know with the Shirley area you know that 's an area where we felt that was central government and and the council we can collaboratively through housing New Zealand that we would get an exemplar project there but apparently the the constraint is our infrastructure so you know I agree on that on that level but what I disagree with us as the is the fact that I mean I know that this is collectively known as the cranford basin but it sits on a rise and and I thought renaming the subdivision cranford rose when it finally comes about might be a good idea because it does sit above the basin but cranford Basin cannot be developed it 's it 's there specifically for a very important purpose and and that is to Brousseau and and this is much closer into town and as we 've heard the capacity can actually be an existing pipe expanded and as we 've heard and in some respects that that capacity is only marginal compared to the to the huge network that that it does serve us so I 'm in favor of this I do think that the the minister will take into account the way that the utes IC responds to this because if it is able to be included into the Utes the urban development strategy then I think that the minister will be in favor of it i think that otherwise it would be at risk so I 'm very much in favor of this occurring but I 've totally agree with counselor johansson that we have to be very careful about infrastructure requirements as against the making land available but I 'd rather that this was i mean i think when our plan was fierce rush on this was probably seen as a rule part of the central city it was and it was always considered to be but we 're very good time yeah and so but no no I 'm just I 'm sorry we 're debating a chapter so it 's not appropriate that people interrupt so but I what I was saying is is that we 've got to be very careful about making sure and having this an hour city plan as available for residential development makes a lot more sense than some of the outer reaches of our boundary wood so our Pauline I agree with both you and Yanni I think proceeding with caution the saving grace is of course that the basin will become a detention pond if you like and it will help the whole system but don 't forget that an in 1989 we had to put in pump station 2 192 actually a piece the flockton and then we come to 2014 and we have to upgrade the pumps again to cope with the water so my worry is that we 're having this increasing events and that the sort the capacity will once again be challenged but I 'll support it for now and does this does take a as well of the ground but those are building technicalities I believe but there has been no they 're urging for a long time to put the residential in here and I think there 's I see the saving grace is that the other side of the road will be one big detention pond which should have actually helped yep all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the next one is the coastal environment do I have a seconder for that clin is there any discussion yani oh no no I thought that was the natural hazards chapter so we can we 'll put this one to one side and move on to natural and cultural heritage yep well if it sorry we 're up to the point of kind of debating or moving amendment so did have you got a question on coastal environment it was really too it was really around in a discussed with helmet this is just a question on a coastal environment year the protection of where the protection of the domes Helen and whither is that I think you said that it was all really really included in them and the plane in terms of their importance I just don 't like Helen up here to speak today just what I 'm just wanting to ensure that in fact some speaking that i 'm giving slip the Sun priority and in the objectives and the plane for the dip the dunes to be included as a protection we 'll just we 'll just locate the coastal chapter and then objective for you is um yeah so the question is as is the June system yes protected now as it is the dune system included a sort of part of of the plec de chiapas objectives as a protection of the other coastal environment I 'm not well let 's move on to the natural and cultural heritage chapter in the meantime we 're still waiting for the Mets I 'm sorry yes okay so we 'll go but natural and cultural heritage we can do without the maps yeah yes right so i 've got i 've moved there as there Clearwater yay um and I mean obviously this goes and is this chapter and then is the central study but just into a consistent approach I just was really interested in this intro city in the fact that the government have gone against their own recovery plan for the Central City important changes so if the government can do that I was kind of thinking why can 't we so if you think of our special immunity areas that the overwhelming number of people wanted retain is that something that we can pop that into the central city given that the government uh putting things that we 've already done that well will exit that 's natural heritage and you 've done the Central City chapter you can of course once this whole process is completed consider a plan change if it 's necessary but we 're chance '_''_1467.89 but we we 've we 've retained at him when we 've retained to except for this interesting because the government we were told we had to be consistent with beer recovery you know we cantle en consistent well that 's with it so now I 'm trying to understand is how are being inconsistent yeah how they 've added a whole bunch of stuff that 's different to what was in that plan what do you mean in the central city chapter it 's just it 's just going off to the ministers now no they know you but our notification is going to them now and our notification is different and inconsistent with what 's in their plan this is to go to the ministers for the comments and they required us to review the entire Central City as part of our district plan so that 's what we 've done I know but the point was when we discussed that we were told that they made it more committing for non-residential activities so I can 't understand what is this to do with the natural and cultural here special immunity here is whether we can extend them as a whole we have another sort of winter sorry no we 've put them but we 're dealing with the natural court cultural heritage chapter it doesn 't apply in natural culture to chapter for the central they 've done all of their last okay so is there any debate on the natural and cultural heritage chapter i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carrying _"

thank you very much indeed and can I just ask one more question sorry the buildings that I proposed the additional four and the central set for there was fire in the central city have where are we actually aware that the components that we 're seeking to make heritage are still there and so this is a similar issue to something you were discussing this morning again would be a matter of getting some feedback from Amanda from a technical expert point of view but just to clarify that point on the trees as well just to let you know that there are trees to be proposed to be triggered within the public ground as well as on privately okay there 's good longer over on Robin there are some trees that will be affected by flood design not meaning though by the flood design rather than the Heritage yeah fine no problem I ender inside of other banners are the features that we 're protecting actually physically still there yes so we 've applied out with the dog a robust methodology and assessment to the new listings and we 're confident that they 're intact and makes them take them so you 've been inside them and cheap it they 're actually dear great thank you all right I yani um just in terms of schedule significant features and landscapes just Victoria Square what so heritage protection does that have okay from a significant landscape or feature and the avon rivers proposed so but from a heritage historic heritage here as a level of protection and so we don 't we 're not proposing to list the square itself as a heritage item but there are a number of features within the square which are protected in the whole of the square is identified as a seating for those items so without previous decision have way basil the way we still run the risk of Victoria Square thin people arguing that which wouldn 't worry about soon because it 's like three development proposals the talks at the wa the thing that struck me was that it was a really inspired piece of you know of of landscaping and when you hear the story behind it it does seem to me that it does mirror some that it 's rather than just being able to change the sitting with it you know it has been proposed so it 's older than the art gallery just by but probably just fits under that um three-year test watching Eddie for one was it readable just when was Victoria Square like I mean in terms of the heritage or having being a landscape for an area see when you hit it all when I heard the talk from the original designer the thing that impressed up what I was impressed upon me was that it was really designed in a wider context into the hole is actually really important if it all relates to each other and it 's quite hard just to take out parts of it because it actually undermines the whole elastic approach that was taken up this is why it 's listed as or explain to you what it means if it 's listed as a setting so decisions we 've identified our areas we have this potentially a crucifix on the listed items and within the square we 've got the bridge telephone cabinet the Town Hall the floral clock BALCA fountain in the two statues unless I see them because of the concentration of individually listed places and Victoria Square we 've identified the whole of Italy season so that gives you a cohesive Britain recognition a bit cohesiveness of that place in terms of actually offering this Victoria Square protection and in and of itself that is something we could look at as part of our rolling time work look at the rolling programme of research and assessment for listing you might able to make that a little bit more it 's proposes to live you but the thing is is that we can 't if they haven 't done the work we can 't actually put it on but I 'm take comfort from the fact that is listed as a sitting and enjoying their individual objects which are you know that that they are all protected well that listed so that means that they 've got to go through a process around around that which I 'm sure I think certain people didn 't take into account but it will that that will enable some protection in the meantime but I agree with yanni I think that I do that work as quickly as as you possibly can I mean I can 't direct any further than that we can 't get you to this chris lawson else now you see thing does that mean is protected through the seating so in other words the two statues there are particular location the founders in a particular location for failure it may be moved those individual items are protected from relocation it 's a real relocation over here to judge them and a heritage seating sorry any heritage seating is proposed as restricted discretionary so what is it at the moment I mean as Victoria Square listed seating at the moment no the only protection is from additional buildings or earthworks or subdivision earth which is the site of would be controls around someone wanted to erect a new building on the site it 's not so much that I mean it is about moving the statues and redesigning it ok but so there 's no protection for victoria square at the moment answer is for the items within disk the items with and so you can 't move an item within it without getting a consent is that right Oh has it been has that been I mean has they 've been notified to the proponents of the change I mean does does the ccd you know that they have to apply for consents to move things than Victoria Square that already have our listing I can 't_''_482.1 say for sure but I 'd be surprised ok and the syrah representative has been involved in the collaborative advisory group meetings we have been discussing these provisions yep yeah oh maybe that 's why the consulting why is a consent and that 's a restricted not at the moment no not at all these rules take a moment they require a computer that 's what we just heard so 's what restricted discretionary is it yes right does that mean that would normally if it was a heritage item would it normally be public you note about I 'm not sure whether it 's got a non no.25 activity status I don 't think it does that something we could could you could you give us a note on that because it 's not relevant to the decision we make today but it is very interesting you a number of us are interested the non-motor five regions can see sorry and and you may want to look at the any of the orders and counsel and and the ccrp as to whether that makes a difference to any of the resource consent obligations because some of them have been alleviated but i don 't know that i don 't know for heritage that it has been for school all the Athens of increasing than this process no as a sitting well as anything so I don 't know if you think of the hospital for notifying it notifying it as a setting a designation has a specific meaning that Iacon seen this is not that about ain 't rollers nest here this the new proposed stadium that 's got a designation we 're putting in roles to support that and I just playing but but the Ivan River precinct never had a designation through the blueprint a bit like the hospital that I think subsequently we 've put a designation on the hospital and rules in place to enable things there that 's like a time when your pleasure but there 's not a requirement to designate the avon river corridor because that was already in either an Esplanade réserver and access reserved or whatever it would have already been in public land so there was no need to acquire it no I mean we 're looking at legal technical ways you know 22 to place additional hurdles in front of things I meant regarding Victoria Square yes yes oh we 're in a situation here where plans have been proposed with our community engagement the community engagements now happen so that may lead to significant changes and their approach so hopefully it will all right so is there 1249 say it 's really quite like being in a on the trees it was really depressing reading to hear the contractors were actually responsible members of damage to the truth I know we 're listing trees on private land and the public ones we 're not have we thought about any controls around we 've only the throttle so the question was about are we I 'm in controls on public land trees yeah I mean so we are proposing rolls around public round trees and streets parks reserves it 's more of a semi sort of blanket type approach approach for to allow our minor pruning going and the like yeah the individual listings as on the privately owned trees do we require intent for the contractors when they don 't works around these streets to the schedule this t-real that in the central city we can 't impose rules on the street trees we can wine or other publicly owned land whether some council ownership hath not in the streets yeah why not because they when they did the recovery plan they wrote out the special purpose can individually list but we can 't impose other rules that we 're proposing from tax and other open spaces okay so who would like to move the central city net for on cultural heritage amendments Paul sticking the Bucky I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the next one the next relate to their coming think this release is there another one underneath it Elizabeth like that 's all let 's fast in the study ok so we haven 't ended vertically past the other ballot building now we haven 't_''_831.86 this is the central city chapter that we 're talking about at the moment you think messages the significant landscape overlay for the Amon river yeah well this yeah there 's nothing there yes but this these are only these resolutions are only in relation to the amendments right that would be opposed by stuff we 're not dealing with anything else appreciate that brigitte said before that there was an overall clause yes it as an overall cool i just don 't want us to walk i right you weren 't doing the overall clause okay Annie we 're not going to keep to your own cause cuz it 's ten to I 'm sorry I tenets to go I have another notified meeting at one o 'clock so I can 't change the time of the meeting and we can 't run over sorry okay this this particular resolution relates to an amendment that was recently done to the part of the Central City chapter related to cultural natural heritage which basically removes any rules and matters of discretion for significant landscape overlay areas part of the central city chapter relating to open spaces relied on that rule being previously there and made activities within that area restricted especially now that that has been removed as a consequential amendment we need to remove the restricted the restrictor discretionary activity from the open space section of the central city chapter because basically there is nothing to rely on and that would be only considered in the case of discretionary activity status right here 's mud yep clear as mud absolutely making it we 're making it to a cease only if the activity becomes a discretionary activity right to the island room would be activities around it would be discretionary an activity within the app Andrew precinct or overlay a significant let 's give overlay that becomes a discretionary activity for whatever other reason will be assessed additionally before against the policies and objectives of the significant landscape overlay but not in the case of restricted aggression activities so again I 'm just struggling to understand whether we 're making it easier for things to happen longer open River or harder it probably depends if it 's set of stricter discretionary activity you could call it easier because there are no rules in the cultural and heritage chapter relating to significant landscape overlay for even however if it is a discretionary activity for whatever other reason an additional assessment matter would be assessing that activity against the objectives and policies of the signal and then skip overly all right so well I 'll move that do I have a seconder pool I put that all those in favor say aye so the post they know it amended version of the coastal environment chapter is being placed in front of you now and in part the amended version response to one of the questions regarding policy 19 13 have first page yep the question was whether we should be exempting the port of littleton have done a little bit more research of course at that meeting councillor tuner quickly emphasized that the recovery plan for the port will override anything in the district plan and indeed the upsets in place we will reserve regret the on hold draft our specific purpose littleton port zone and make that consistent with the recovery plan yep and that will come through at a separate time we 've done a little bit more work on that and referred to the minister 's comments as I see that the other day that because this chapter was going through as a stage 2 chapter we have the benefit of those comments and one of the key comments is that they suggest that the draft chapter fails to consider the role of infrastructure in the environment is directed by the New Zealand coastal policy and nine and also the first policy one asking for recognition of infrastructure policy nine particular refers to the port so to actually address those concerns which I think are valid I 'm suggesting that instead of just accepting the port we actually broaden the exception to include critical structure now critical infrastructure has already defined in the stage one definitions as including christchurch airport littleton port guests and storage distribution facilities electricity stations importantly for air point of view strategic roads and rail networks and the likes so i think that this would be a better fit in terms of recognition of that high order documents such as a new zealand coastal policy statement otherwise I think we 're open to submissions yep from the minister 's no I think that 's good you have you to move that Andrew and David would love to second it no he doesn 't want to second it Phil would like to second it so I just thought i 'd share the love I 'll put that night which part of the chat page seven at the bottom of the page yes cancel your husband and so we relocated that reference and I 've actually included the sheet to earth that was on page five yes so it 's just a renumber agree just reformatted the the chapter to be consistent with other chapters does it reflect the stage while adhering it reflects what you 've already had presented to you as part of the second part of the residential chapter that my colleague see Oliver covers off with you and about the work shopping so that 's consistent with what was a green beer but but all we voting on here as the amendment with the exception of critical infrastructure to replace port of little tongue the other part of the amendment to deleting that overarching policy that we 're proposing to include and the strategic direction oh yeah do that any longer because as we know the decisions released by the independent hearings panel on the strategic directions chapter has taken out all policies so here we 're just going to rely on an existing objective for that okay so so we don 't we don 't need the amend do you do lovely well we 're deleting it I did it yeah yeah yeah yeah ok so those are the two things that we 're doing yet our minor amendments of course a court by sort of wrap up yep provisions of the overall resolution okay i 'll put that motion all those in favor say hi there 's a cosine oh that 's carried so i think that 's as far as we can come on sorry i know this family two more well i have got a sheet gelatin notified meeting how quickly are they bit ly well it 's really just cranford basin and wounding finish and and then just passing the overall resolutions yes hey yet but that the overarching resolution oh I mean that the overarching resolution is to confirm all of the chapters so subject to these atoms but I don 't_''_1343.009 I don 't want to do that right today I so on Wednesday what we do is I 'll get you to to put all of the chapters that we 're signing off in the elements within them just an order so because we can we can I want to do them chapter by chapter because yannis raised a point as which is that there is no opportunity to vote on an amendment that a counselor wants to move unless we do it chapter by chapter so we 've got all the technical stuff out of the way and that can then focus everyone 's mind on the individual chapters and will sign them off now if there 's no problem with a chapter it will take a minute but if there is an issue then we can debate it and will and I 'll ask the meeting to come prepared on Wednesday morning with all of the detail of the that they want to that they want to focus on and get people to think about the amendments ahead of time that they want to put in front of the meeting so amount it 's that means that Europe three days later on and change phone notification I had thought that we had understood all of the issues to date and so we have amended the chapters but that 's they look through the problem is that you know and the problem is is that we are under an enormous pressure of time and you know I mean you 've got the technical expertise I certainly don 't and you know if councillors feel at the end of this process that they haven 't had their issue put on the table for a vote then we 've got no chance to resolve that when it comes back from the minister so I 'd rather take the three days and let people feel that they 've had a fear suck of the save as one would say and colloquial terms so let 's see if we can get through cranford basin this is the ODP for Cranford Basin residential rezoning this is also subject to the as a subject you want to do this now we 're on Wednesday well let 's see if we can all sort of infrastructure I do have that I dress I 'm just worried that we could have made it if we don 't open in four minutes basically in mex no no it 's if there 's lots of questions then I won 't do it so we 'll do this at the beginning of the making of people could on Wednesday be comedy Nick sweden 's day I what I could do is I could have June the meeting and we 'll see if my old unit but we 'll see if we can get an earlier time but Wednesday 's fine but could we perhaps add on an extra half hour just so that we can finish rules on when you know that it 's nice to see this is why I 'm being problem this is why I have a transition advisory board on that day right next Wednesday as the as the sixth of make yes yes I can so and yeah i can i 'll make that from eight o 'clock to 930 great think right yep we can say eight to nine is currently in your diary and will extend it till nine-thirty thank you right okay so if you could notify our officers of that changing time that 's great thank you thank you very much to meetings a June _"

    "text": "and if you think about it you know it 's still an office facility it 's not really the definition of community facilities and I mean it can still go alongside shops and things like that but not on the residential areas yeah yeah that 's right yeah could go anywhere yeah all right good good afternoon so I hope that we could finish the resolutions today and to approve these chapters and section 32 reports to go through to the minister we will start with the resolutions for the city center yep let 's to do with the city centre chapter and I 'll hand you over to Peter Amon while I put an additional resolution that is great and thank you okay we 'll start with the commercial zones and a lot of these are ones that you actually seen previously at the presentation and they 're pretty small things so the first one is to consider appropriate clause numbers that 's really our current system somehow put a whole of the zeros and some of the course numbers yep and the second one relates to deleting yard just can we float up that 's what I should be sorry this we 're trying to do two things at once can we scroll up the amendments please can we scroll up the existing ones school sorry can we scroll up the existing ones yep so no go back not that far not that far I know that you 're working over there but we want to see what we 're voting on in the meantime right that 's great yes it is yard based not suppliers so we 've got insert '_''_131.45 the appropriate clause numbers into the rules no problem with that and delete item five plan implementation detail yard based suppliers in the South frame from the commercial zone section 32 all right okay Simon lately sorry not this one I was just going to move that seems sensible to me yeah look that 's fine yeah Paul you 'd like to move it and David would like to second it i 'll put that motion yep just tell me with it what the I 'm not quite sure the impact of the may be honest by taking up the ad base suppliers from me because in fact they have been no change to guide based the supplies that were already remember me not employing activities yes and I remain non-complying activities so there was no reason to highlight that in the section 32 because we weren 't changing anything okay okay okay i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so did you get the mover and seconder that was moved by paul lonsdale seconded by david East great next one so this is the first of the new ones between humans which is proposing to remove both emergency services or fees and communal community directions yeah yes as permitted activity its productivity you 're going to replace emergency services central city and restricted discretionary yep and Community Corrections facilities will become by default that 's prolly discretionary so we 're not putting we 're just having delete that activity Community Corrections Facility yeah yep all right so yep description activity otherwise be there won 't be and you have there 's nothing in there 't mean like the key issue with the communication siphelele that 's suitable for visiting overload it 's been the lack of public notification so I just want to make sure that there is something can hear that means that there should be no fun well I 'm going so even if we take it out hug it could still be the description if you 've seen on notified going and that 's from the Lord well this the provisions that we were able to put in there as if we 're going to limit notification otherwise the the council needs to go through the process of deciding whether or not to notify I 'm probably talking across witnesses so when you say limit notification yep that there is less notification to the community or no notification you can actually specify that it non-compliance with a rule will be non notified and no neighbors continue no no we 're not limiting them because if we were it would be up in that box right okay so we 'll go through the normal tears yes in obviously not hire result would do that as well yes you have the completed the option to do either according to the considerations of the it contained statement of expectations and given us is in the ccrp you would need to consider that so which lesson our elf ears in the community corrections and residential area we could say I 'm not accepting and putting this forward that this is a pd center it 's it 's not we 've already been told that detention does not apply I don 't vary the case there 's no but we 've had if we 've had advice that that is the case I mean I can stuff just say okay with the community direction since I will not have any P very otic attention or any type of activities that would be associated with the pd center in the past it 's custodial custodial it doesn 't apply to the definition that are you that I read out earlier is non custodial yeah it specifically uses the word administrative and non custodial also add that also noted that in terms of in terms of the material drafted and yet there 's also if you wanted to maintain some form of Community Corrections Facility as merry as a defined term their definition would need to be added so that they 're so the recommendation from the staff is we we can 't go back and change what has gone through the hearings for the residential stage one at this stage they are complete although the decision isn 't released yeah but we can do this is yeah all right yeah that 's so in its and that 's what we should encourage but make sure when you encourage people to make submissions that you don 't_''_484.37 I understand must lead them about what a community corrections facility is and by then we will have a definitive I with mission all right so what I 'll move that would someone like to second that motion Phil I 'll pop that all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried right next one central city 's schools have closed up because they 're both exactly the same thing and it 's just minor routing changes are relation precinct the aminos the assignments don 't do that they changed the name of the minor artery aterial to main distributor and local distributor as opposed to collect it but in but that 's all we 're voting on now you know but in the plan and what commercial can still become school and the innovation precinct can still have a university component in it it 's got nothing to do with the cement that up in the plane will can we can we note that as a question can somebody get the answer to it before we actually vote on the final notification so can we deal with 3.1 and 3.2 a three point one point two and three point one point three together as a single amendment a resolution so would someone like to move that David seconded by Paul Yanni so these are matters of discretion so that 's when an application is being sought and these are things that need to be considered and it 's really just yep just to be around you 'd have a higher level of description to assist traffic okay with this this resolution is nothing to do with the little discretion it 's simply stating what the matters are there are to be considered when a resource consent is required but I 'm trying to understand whether it 's favorable and it 's on a local distributor ride at least favorable it just states what is going to be assessed it doesn 't under Kate either way it 's just a an assessment criteria it 's a bit like an assessment criteria considering heritage values or something like that there is one of the things that is able to be considered as part of the consideration of the resource consent in just clarifying wording can you just changing way to affect the current district final terms of the right environment this year sister fit exactly with the transport section right I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried three point one point for Central City flatlands of recovery zone a minute we move up central city education so reducing or you know under an RMA you have obviously would be to have non educational activities so in light of what happen which I want to try to avoid going forward is it possible to have an amendment to make it harder for non reason interactivity technique for scholars to get children I 'd need to get Glinda beg because this was a this was a question that was put to Glinda on Wednesday the rules in the simplicity was an internal design limit the size of education activities in fact a large number of non-residential activities and there 's also a whole list of controls in terms of hours of operation and various things I think the current district plan isn 't and even the needs into a city plan isn 't successful in my view doesn 't have enough tail around preventing the under utilization of prime residential land or residential been used for alternative non-sustainable non-official uses this so that we don 't get can you write up an amendment for that for the particular clause that you want I mean we 're going to have to I mean we can we just go through these technical amendments that we need to get sorted out we 're not really sort of discussing what 's behind the then only actually changing the terminology yes I know that but what counts are your Hanson 's brazing is how do you propose amendments to chapters that we 're going to sign off for sending to the ministers knowing full well that if we don 't get something and before they go to the minister we can 't change it when they come back unless the ministers raise them as issues I mean so and that 's something that I 'm not sure that we can do in the time frame that we 've got so but let 's get the amendments out of the way and then I think that rather than do one blanket and resolution we 're going to have to do chapter by chapter so we know specifically what chapters we 're sending off to the to the minister and if there are issues that people want to raise in that context then we 'll raise them but i think the quicker we get through the carry on with these central city flatland recovery zone amendments so I 've sent around an updated version of this chapter and I 'm proposing mmmm that 's following a legal review feedback as well as the amendments in terms of the questions that you raised on Wednesday yep so you 'll be able to see in red and strike through we 're on proposing changes and I piece in summary it was to aid with clarification or where there was duplication with the natural hazards chapter to remove that you 'll see that p12 is proposing the new permitted activity for the stormwater all sort of basin works but I can also update that in relation to your request earlier on this morning about making sure that that would cover wetlands yep things like that and also the removal of stop banks if necessary as well so just anything you want me to elaborate on then I know I think that 's fine i 'm i 'm happy to move that do I have a seconder for that do I have a seconder I 'm Pauline um Yanni future this this only applies to the central city flatland recovery zone area which was as I understand previously residential so the other area is already kept is that why anything outside the central city is covered by the specific purpose flatland recovery chapter which is coming up after this is anything outside of the flatland recovery zone in the central city that has the natural hazards what will repurpose over like in just extending it across the river no this is this is just a zoning for work we 're looking at the resolution up atop three point one point four so it 's not an overlay it 's just as a zoning 100cm I in a residential area that 's right next to a commercial area that the only reason the commercial yer wasn 't reads owned is because it 's commercial so it 's got the same identical characteristics and I 'm just trying to ensure that has the same zoning it 's my understanding that there weren 't any commercial areas within the central city that were reassigned this does not clued land that wasn 't red are we confident enough that the assistance been robust enough that it 's a consistent approach the council wasn 't responsible for deliberating on what was red zoned or not that was the minister 's decision and so there 's a society holdings are named that sees very clearly this is a holding zone that will be subject to a later plan change to confirm the zoning pattern which will borne by the outcome of the residential breeds own program I mean it may well become residential game at some stage in the future depends entirely on the outcome of the future use yep all right so I 've got a mover in a second or I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried we did Central City natural hazards to eat no we didn 't this is as a new new provisions basically to bring the Central City provisions in line with the natural hazard provisions applying to the rest of the city in respective yep high hazard areas yep I 'm happy to move there do I have is there just yeah there 's just the one motion required for this yep i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no okay all right next one central city hospital zone amendments so this is basically allowing the crotch for my pressure Children 's Hospital to be used for activities permitted in residential zones if it 's not used for Hospital purposes right okay so who would like to move that Paul seeking to Andrew i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried central city utilities amendments this is just deleting clauses out of the utilities section because they 're already dealt with in the hazardous substances and can be contaminated land section so I 'll move that seconded by Glenn i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried simple set of rules and procedures Amendment ok so these just added the appropriate met numbers you can see on the far right column I it for identification and then we keep flicking down want to pass that resolution first yes if you want to do the to the other one was just too I mean the stone host accommodation scheduled site area to extend it to its full extent all right well we can pass those case as single resolution I 'm not in position to answer this Allison might this far on the stoners accommodation for and third well the scheduled activities have standards that provide some additional development beyond what they would have through existing use rights and those standards have been reviewed against what those own standards are so in some cases for example in the I think the residential zone that 's set back from the road is going from 3 meters to 2 meters so I 've updated the scheduled activity standards to match changes that have happened in those own standards where that 's appropriate but generally there hasn 't been a large change in the standards for those scheduled activities that 's there 's nothing in that would surprise the community I wouldn 't think so I mean there 's there 's not very significant changes generally just matching changes that have happened that through the zone rules to be consistent with those but also keeping in mind that that some of these activities are different from what would be anticipated for those communities and then trying to particularly with some of the landscaping rules I 'm trying to provide for a little bit more I 'll move the tomb resolutions together pawling I put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried interest early definitions it says a number of amendments here adding the definition education central city because some rules refer to that tomb rather than say referring to particular zones so it cited we needed a definition then the other changes we bring the Reliant and related definitions and to the table so it 's doesn 't change the definition itself it just advises people of what other definitions and there may need to refer to it we 're looking at their definition and then a number of other minor changes to definitions all right so can we deal with all three of them together is like to move there I 'm Jimmy second up by Paul I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed to know it 's great central city natural and cultural heritage you get to Caroline to talk to you about because there 's much more about it than me just a handout from Kimberly relating to the resolution sphere and the first one is in relation to the just making some clarification to the clauses that have immediate legal effect and it 's similar as you considered for chapter 9 some minor verification points there the second point is amend the chapter a shounen document table and that concerns in particular something also that you 're considered for chapter 9 in relation to heritage upgrade works going to a controlled activity status group one heritage items and a clarification of the works and the settings to be not non notified and the third one is just a minor point to clarify something that 's been proposed in the rules to just confirm that we 're not carrying over a specific exemption from noise standards in relation to the chapter 13 appendices for all of the schedules so again similar to the document you receive for chapter 9 about the list of proposed heritage items etc so minor clarification points to mapping numbers the proposed tree to not be included on the list and some other minor points so this is an amendment to the section 32 as a and the three of the amendments were like to throw one two three of the amendments relate to the chapter and one of the amendments relates to it just as a minor clarification point in the section 32 documentation or but it still contains the proposed listing for the building known as the form of beach south of balance prescribes the entire building yes I understand that you resolved to make a different resolution on that today so yeah that what you 've had table is as the printout it was prepared prior to your resolution there is a there is a sorry I cover all recommendation at the very end of this long table for consequential amendments okay all right the other list I 'm sorry and I 'm assuming a part of this our any of those bridges in any way to be replaced in terms of blood methylation more anything like that does it affect any proposed work on those bridges and so in terms of the heritage items that are proposed if a proposal came in for any other any type of development that would need to be considered relative to the Heritage listing and what the impact would be on that Heritage listing but also in the context of flood mitigation so it would be a re main consideration we aware of the need to replace any of those bridges which we 're currently is proposing to list I 'm not aware myself but I could defer to one of our technical experts to see if they are aware of anything and I 'll just say however this is the same I understand assure this morning I understand the issue I 'm just also aware of the practicalities confirmation that there 's no proposal to replace e excellent okay thank you and use the trees other trees in this list as well that on the question so the trees are proposed and the listings and so are you asking whether any of proposed to be altered as a result of flood mitigation is there for example year is there any proposal to that would affect any of those trees that you 're aware of I 'm not aware personally myself but I guess that may come up for instance in the flat land recovering zone it would be a matter of anjou course but Shane row and his our City arborist may have some information on there he probably has _"

    "text": "ESPYs in flatland before we go on to their mayor just raised there was discussion about having an assessment undertaken of the art gallery and I 'd like to invite Helen to speak to why that is not possibly necessary do we need to do that now it was a question that was raised okay sorry I simply I 've gone gone back to the definition of historic heritage and the Resource Management Act and we put it bluntly don 't believe there 's enough history with that building yet to consider listing it it 's a very recent building and that there is no that is not to say it 's not a very important and valuable building and may well be listed in the future but at present we do not consider it has enough history to list under the under the resource management age what on that we do discuss this today because obviously stuff we 're going to go away and do assessments before it came back with the minister 's comments so that we could make decisions and so can I can I just ask seating of that building given its significance to listen if it 's not heritage season do you mean beyond the bounds of the land past remediate land parcel stop like 60 meter fillings creating shadows over it for I think I 've to defer that question to Caroline who 's been looking at the the rules related to development on a dating site yeah it 's it 's not that what we 're saying is that it it doesn 't meet the threshold for being listed as a heritage building so the rules about development on adjacent sites would not would not be appropriate for this it 's really about whether or not there are other mechanisms under the air think that that would need to be addressed and that that then becomes an urban designer shoe essentially it 's rather than a hero suggestions we say we don 't that means that we can 't muster it 's not a be pardoned what 's your reading that that means that we cannot sir it 's not heritage history its historic heritage and it 's not just cultural heritage listening a certain time frame well yes so is there a rule of thumb is it with the Historic Places New Zealand now heritage New Zealand used 30 years as a sort of rule of thumb although it 's not written down anywhere the youngest building on our listing I believers in 1980s building on the Christ College site and the next youngest would be the town hall which is 1960s I was saying it 's a significant building and should have protection there 's nothing stopping us saying it 's a significant building but our professional opinion is that it does not reach the threshold to be listed as an historic heritage item which is what the Resource Management Act provides for it 's it 's a little bit like if the naturalness test for outstanding natural landscapes if you like so there are many outstanding natural landscapes in New Zealand and indeed the view of the sky tower from the harbor of Auckland would be one but it doesn 't reach the naturalness criteria so it doesn 't get a listing under the resource management date I personally think I think it is whether it 's a listing or a designation but there needs to be some protection around it because it is actually a pretty important building in our central city and it really well I mean because of the amount of money you division talk oh sorry I mean council that decided to base isolate the art gallery ahead of doing other things as just you know very interesting so like david says you know that 's my view that 's just a great point but I actually think what we saw those apart going right behind it is not good development for a city and I think we do need to think about but this chapter doesn 't allow for it so no it does no it doesn 't we 've just had advice that the RMA provides for historic heritage and it doesn 't we need salt what a taste and the tested we 've just heard from our professional staff which we 've just congratulated for efficient ilysm of their assessment you just heard that there 's no finite number of years now I doesn 't meet the standard so there is one more issue before we move on to then the resolutions for the city centre on the agenda I have noted that there was also the remaining resolution for heritage regarding the historic building schedule he passed everything else in relation to this chapter last Wednesday which is why we added sent out that extra material to last night that can be captured in the overall resolution about approving all of the chapters subject to resolutions if you 're happy to leave it at that or do you have any further questions about the historic building schedule no I don 't think so i think we already passed all of that i mean i just found that their information was really helpful and i wondered whether it shouldn 't be I mean it 's obviously not going to be listed in that way and we can put it online though as a helpful yeah I think I would be useful because then people can see really clearly what it does and it might be useful to refer ministers to it as well yep ok so you happy with the rest of the historic building scheduled to be approved with the overall resolution it 's fine thank you on the high street so we got the information back on high street so there 's a number of buildings so you know I was trying to understand why we will look that as a kind of conservation you still got the existing galaxy baby the main reason is because the identification and protection of Heritage Areas is outside the scope of district plan reviews we 've provided for heritage areas and the policy and deposit policy level and we 've identified as future work identification and protection of heritage areas so how do we get that work happening that would be that would need to be a plane change subsequent to the district plan review right so we 'll leave that till April 2016 no we don 't have the timing to do it now I 'm sorry there 's a these are the final chapters that are due to go to the ministers next week and the rest of my and it was community has been asking for a long time how many of those have been put in well we have to head competition we have in 2005 we asked the community to tell us which buildings they wanted listed and we had a public consultation and engagement process and I just want to know how many of those buildings have been put into our district where I haven 't gone back to that previous information because as part of this district and review is just relied on research that we 'd already done since we had 60 sites for search committee listed both that came out of that word yeah but I haven 't tracked back the exact numbers of what kind of I 've got about 60 new buildings are being proposed Lester than this claim I 've storm that really work well it was 60 before the earthquakes but that 's being reduced down to 27 due to demolition and lack of research to move them forward at this time we do have in our work program a rolling programme of work to research and add new listings through potential new disease each year so is there any other cook away than a plan chose like can we go for a resource consumed no now to put them in the district plan requires a full plan change process for each individual one yes but we can do I mean we can do them in groups of say ten if the assessment work has been completed so you can get a resource consent to remove a heritage building but you can 't get one to everyone you can get a resource consent to demolish a building is that what you 're saying yes know what to remove it from the last time to put my tomorrow you can 't know you can 't_''_547.85 but through our consent process you cannot doesn 't remove it by dead or except 3d motion all right so we 'll come to the end of the position and we 're back here at 12 for one hour so how many amendments do we need to get through and the one hour because what I 'm suggesting is that is that this documents actually incredibly useful need to do so I 've just asked for it to be emailed to me so shall we get it emailed to everyone so everyone can just look at all of the amendments I ten just we have it so I 'll copy it and leave it all on your desks well yeah I mean I 'd quite like a copy now to take with me but if we could email it to people and leave a copy on people 's desk and that 's fine but I just think that that would speed things up when we come back yes what how many amendments are left to go it 's amendments on the city center specific paper so in flatland recovery cranford base and coastal environment and just those consequential amendments yeah but is it much you know like it 's one yeah is it going to mean is it going to take a lot of time as well yeah yeah okay all right look up what we 'll do is we 'll we 'll adjourn the meeting until 12 o 'clock and when we come back we will there 's the entire resolution that covers them all off right thank you _"

    "text": "just switched on for me we 'll go on to the natural hazards resolution so that with so that we can while this is the presentation is just crystal clear in our minds and then we 'll do the the beats building and then we 'll come back to the rest so if we could turn our attention to the amendments so these are all spelt out and what you 've left on our desk is it know what 's on old desk as the graph chapter and verse it can 32 right so if you do look at the graph chapter on page 3 at the top you 'll see the amended ruling of the policy that 's being proposed in the resolution right yeah Henry and that phrase high-risk that 's the phrase that 's been accepted for the part 1 is it also reflects the New Zealand coastal policy statement in the regional policy statement just what it make it a bit clearer yep yep yep so their endeavors actually better wording wording than likely to be subject to any way it was about Willie in an to make the amendment to that part of the policy so I 'll move there do I have a second of that Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let 's carry the next hey you what you want to you want to leave it as likely to be subject to as opposed to high-risk hey yeah I know I know that but I think that I think that you this amendment is one that you would support because it 's actually increasing the test it 's not decreasing the test it 's saying avoiding subdivision and development in areas of high risk affected by coastal erosion as opposed to likely to be subject to all right so okay so I 'm well aware all right so so that 's carried and could you note that councillor David East opposed no no no you 're entitled to your view now you 're entitled to your point of view absolutely absolutely titled and I didn 't hear the the comment but if the if the if the well no well I and am very well aware you are entitled to your point of view yep no I and I accept that so and I do apologize or anything that I said was taken in any other way other than to say that I 'm very well aware of your views and I 'm not disparaging them in any way and I 'm stating for the record that you are perfectly entitled to have those views and to have your opposition to each of these resolutions recorded I got to apologize if I caused offense today that 's not an enormous re i left my filter at home again the filter right so the next resolution is the tidy up of provisions around tiwari were like 45 in terms of the flood level in full management area if you would like me to clarify it yet we 've just had some new information based on the flood events last year in that area right and and that information is that we can 't really rely any longer on the existing provisions if we 're going to have to make it a higher test activity and just expanding the clarifying the restricted discretionary activity so it is a higher test for people but that 's that 's the reality of bringing live on page 16 so it shouldn 't that red amend restricted as an ED at the end delete permitted activity to an amend restricted discretionary become yeah ed at Michelle and the other thing that I said this is not a climate change issue this is the current flood if you could might argue and that 's where of my colleague Graham Harrington was here that it may be related to climate change and that we 're getting these exacerbated weather conditions and high water levels but these are not the floor level and fill management is a secret this is a separate area so I 'm just drawing it to your attention David this isn 't a climate change issue this one yep so it was part of a meaningless well we 're also extending the area covered around the Little River area and the head of our late way we are for that purpose to recognize this new information so up by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a post they know that 's carried but the rest all to do with them I mean are we able to put them together as what the like that last one really oh right ok there 's only one more as you saw in the presentation earlier there are more extensive areas within the city of notified zones that will be caught now by the floor level on full management area right and also and the information only on the tsunami yep okay well I 'm happy to move that zero seconder for that Glenn lovingston and I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye opposed say no it 's carried and notes David East close so i just pointed out met mad amir that the very first resolution which we will deal with at the end of the day approves all of them subject to these subject to these amendments thank you that 's that 's what i was looking for right okay all right so now can we go would like to make is that we simply notify the existing coverage so the the areas of the building that are already covered by what is that category for lust as cat or the stairs category two under the proposed rule so I 'll move that if that 's the right wedding and that Andrew might like to second that it would need to go up on the board right so can we help with some wedding so I suggest that what we do is amend their listing amend the listing will 1464 146 casual street casual street and 68 to colombo street the former beats department store to include the former beds department store the EA th s yep sorry could I mean the 682 26 90 yep you may yep to include only those elements of the external facade detailed and the operative district plan detailed on the operative plan yep and that 's moved by me seconded by Andrew so any discussion I 'll put that motion I just got a question what this does to all the other heritage listings we 're trying to protect ceilings of the new changes that we look wider than just the existing heritage and we do give some context to the seating because that 's important consideration is so so that will remain so we 're not we 're not proposing to amend the section 32 analysis or amend our evaluation of significance the the motion on the table is simply an amendment for this particular building that yeah that 's fine so people other buildings challenge us why we why we have protected wider than just the Heritage specific detail here at each paper it because we 're trying to protect the seating what is our response going to be this is the only building where webex she changed we 're the original proposal was to change the operative plan provision I mean apart from you know like ghosting the different categories but but in terms of extending the extent of the listing there 's no other there 's no other building on our listing where we previously listed the whole and we sorry where we previously listed the facade and we recommended that that listing now extend to there but so if you own a heritage building and you 're not happy with the facade bangla said all that why do well how many facades are listed so we 've got McKenzie and was at the moment the whole facade is listed right McKenzie and wellness the facade is listed and the Isaac Theatre Royal Isaac Theatre Royal and they 've got components but we haven 't_''_687.57 extended that because of course there 's nothing else other than the components so but is there any other facade that has been listed as a whole facade that previously was only parts of the facade no so this is the only one what it it 's not setting a precedent which is the question that you 've asked will others complain because this has been treated differently this is the only building that is in this position and all we 're doing is reinstating the extent of the listing that was there before you know I understand there but I also know that we 've done as we 've gone through our robust heritage assessment around buildings which we did the entire building in 1995 through and through the different high courts and things like um edenfield it became very apparent that some of our previous heritage listings hadn 't had the work done to sufficiently give them protection and the CD player so start whipping through have been through a process studying 2005 to refine our heritage listings based on a new way of assessing things so that things that up do have heritage to commitments do you have the level of protection that we desire and it in a new way and dead ensure that is your view and you 're entitled to express such another than the debate the social well well the thing is is that ipod the thing is is that you 're asking questions the questions had been answered the end you don 't agree with the answer the question around intuitive a curettage a six-month if we make this decision doesn 't put it in breast of the process by which were identified other heritage items they met why the context and if not why not well I actually had called for the to that question does this decision put anything else that you 've done at risk well I mean look may it the places that you you 're giving evidence to the ass it may open the door to other building owners to make a submission on listing a part of the building and we are quite confident that we have the evidence and a robust evaluation framework under the Resource Management Act that we can defend those listings yeah so we are quite confident about that and I 've just checked in terms of the difference now between 1995 in today and historic heritage was elevated to become a section 6 meter and we think that was 2003 so the the legislative framework has changed between 1995 in today right so is there any debate but I don 't support this amendment it 's not because I don 't want to see things we 've done in heritage buildings and I think we have actually throw a district plan come up with a much more pragmatic approach to heritage buildings but this is a process of identifying what is heritage of what is there so I actually do think it 's important but just because someone has to get a consent doesn 't mean that they aren 't allowed to make changes in fact what it does is a safeguard against having development that 's out of kilter that looks awkward that doesn 't relate to their protected Heritage fabric of the building so I personally don 't I 'm changing this listing based on concern that somehow going to slow down stop the development is the way to go in fact I think it 's actually quite good to have a certain level of assessment based on this forsaken given its prominence on a pretty important corner into the new city so I do think staff have been through a really robust analysis and you know I would have liked to seeing more Heritage Center I said rather than this but I don 't_''_949.07 I don 't think it warrants risking others to be able to been challenged every item in there in our heritage plan because they want only that specific heritage features protected rather than a context think of the art gallery which although we don 't have a protected listing on at the moment actually seems silly that you can have 22-metre apartments built right behind it they have all sorts of impacts on on their art gallery that that you know you don 't protect that thing in the seating or if you think of you know for example other things where buildings right next to our heritage building actually mean that those heritage vectors are covered up so I think it is important to protect the sitting I don 't think by not having this amendment we stop anything happening we simply have a safeguard around particularly heritage which I support so everybody for us I think that it 's my view it 's very important that we think of this and it in the individual context that this is the only building that originally was to be set aside for a complete change from external facade only to a listing for the whole for the internal elements as well that has been adjusted all we 're doing here as saying that the listing detailed in the operative district plan that leads it the way that it was prior to the to this going forward and I think that that 's an appropriate step to take I understand that in terms of everything that we 've lost you know there is a greater focus and obviously I 'm not challenging at all the detailed analysis that staff have done that acted entirely professionally in that regard I think that this is finding the right balance and it doesn 't it hasn 't actually that this listing hasn 't actually prevented this that the part of the facade that we all remember as the as that front piece for the best department store from from our days as children it has been protected under the operative district plan and I 'm confident or continue to be protected with this with this element and the with these elements specifically listed in the and the new plan so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no and if you could record yani against thank you very much right so the next item on the agenda is the _"

    "text": "you can tell me I 'm wrong it 's invoke that says you have to be in both oh do you have a degree do you feel about they no no you don 't need to be the distinction is between coastal erosion area 1 and coastal erosion area to or coastal inundation one and coastal inundation to so this area of lynnwood is coastal inundation too so it 's looking at 100 years it 's not looking at 14 there so it 's not a non-perfect doesn 't hear it flat so it 's perfectly by understandable that you have conceived it well if you owners just look at it is an SEMA one yep oh boy so we 'll check the celiac receipt cross C to which the moment isn 't living area but just leave regardless i guess the point I was trying to understand as starting it is really important to think about it 10 suppose retailing and just whittling to I talking to each other now give a decision to go anyway yep so SEMA one is if it will check that check the accuracy all times or what plant page number mac number you know 39 39 mm-hmm yep I think it 's because of jackson 's crinkled is a creeks streams it 's not about was great girl stripping people yeah so as we 've seen earlier there 's a lot of overlap with the floor level and fill management areas and similar attributes my question is this talking to the residential stage why decisions have been made through the hearings panic around here is the gift that conversations be head and certainly it didn 't form the intensification provisions of the residential chapter but the night is standing as government haha to even intensify even more in some of these areas again that conversation is being held and that concerns been taken on board and certainly some areas that were initially and the draft chapter a residential chapter identified for intense location will pull back with some when this information became available I 'd quite like to go wrap up the residential what that just that overlay these two overlays on I can I can get that to you probably not today really interesting to look at ok so just going attention again to the table of rules on start on page 19 and encoder page 20 the slide that you 're looking at is referring now to the restrictive controls applying to subdivision and new buildings and then going on to hazard mitigation works less restrictive we 've got a discretionary activity proposed that status of activity anticipates that activity will go there but assessment criteria are needed to assess how appropriate at us there we 've got a definite definition a new definition of coastal hazard mitigation which right at the end of the chapter so this is a new chapter and effectively we 're recognizing that both natural resilience provided by the June system and physical infrastructure are likely in these areas they 're already there there 's an extensive seawall development around much of the district in our coral harbour there 's kilometres of it protecting the roads in particular we 're aware of the sea walls leading from very Meade area out to somewhere in the revetments it protects much of the summer village there 's also I shall see to the upgrading or new infrastructure discretionary activity now these controls have a lot of parallels with what 's been agreed through the mediation process and what the council had put forward as part of a revised first part of the chapter before the hearings panel so can I just ask you about on page 19 and that 's the coastal erosion and inundation rules and like there 's reference to that when there 's a consent application required that that we would be looking for that would be required to be undertaken by a chartered professional engineers with experience in coastal has annasophia mitigation and when I take though into account that when I look at for example the presentation we had from Deidre heart and end other engineers it just seemed to me and they they see this as hell they 're doing it that the interdisciplinary approach actually led to the best best results and end all that we need to get be more across there so it just seems to me that and like one of them one of those authors as a tell is a coastal specialist and there are our other geological engineers so just seems to me that this is in terms of getting the best science and the clearest science this is pretty restrictive a bit narrow yes northern about I mean it 's and so I I just think a broader definition of who we might pull on for the best information something like a recognized physical coastal specialist or words words that effect but certainly that it be broadened and it 's worth quaint with all due respect engineers who are you know obviously would need to be included I 'll just emphasize that because the coastal erosion is a topic it 's probably one of the most controversial between scientists and engineers fundamentally we have different approaches of looking things an engineer 12 has remit is normally to design something to ever a certain lifetime etc whereas the coastal scientists look at the bigger picture and understand what the prices are doing that it can be a conflict of interest so we do have to be careful that I 'm not saying that we want to need the scientists and at the same time we 'd be forward to understand the big picture and then decide where it 's appropriate to do an engineered structure or not can I just add that that report would go to the planner who would be NSS that against other information that that cleaner would receive so what is listed here is simply a technical matter that we need to put in as part of the assessment of that for that particular site all resource consents particularly if they are you know when they 're not permitted when they restricted discretionary or discretionary they weigh various other technical input as well from various other disciplines and the planners role is to weigh all of that and to consider all of them so no I 'm not convinced that it shouldn 't be broader within the district play we can certainly come at me or something like other wording that would broaden that you okay so kept have you finished the presentation or no they 're just disappear or less sort of saying that just to remind the counselors and you 're awaiting an anticipation that both the natural hazard strategy and the resilience strategy that are being appeared as well and that there are asked some resolutions as presumably one will feed into the other so the natural hazards will feed into the resilient strategy um is where does this fit with what he can announce recently because they aren 't they developing some sort of natural hazards strategy as well his environment canterbury are leading a regional approach to natural hazards and that 's that 's very appropriate as we have much the same hesitancy especially up and down the coast as other settlements but the territorial authorities and particularly Christchurch being a very large urban area have specific issues within that regional approach that they must also address so we 're developing the scope for our natural hazard strategy in close consultation with Environment Canterbury so to our natural hazard strategy will be a component of the regional one as well our natural hazard strategy will be our own but it will be integrated with the regional one and it 'll also integrate with the regional approach to those other strategies and plans in document I just worry about duplication that 's all the won 't be duplication but but there will be so what we 're what we came to do is actually leverage off the work that other other local authorities are doing right but for a city like Christ Church where we 've got intense development closing area host we need quite sophisticated management of the coastal hazards whereas other local authorities don 't have that concentration of development so close to the coast as you know I 've written two ministers and had a reply in relation to the need for a national policy statement or environmental standard under the RMA and unfortunately haven 't had the positive feedback that I might have expected but I kind of would like to know whether do you think that that is that would it be helpful for us because what I worry about is is that we end up having an isolated debate and Christchurch about issues in relation to climate change for example to coastal erosion impacts on potential and undone you know based on but it 's not it 's a national conversation that we ought to be having so I 'm looking at the nodding at the end of the table to say that we should continue to to pursue the objective of a national but it would have been national environmental standard or a national policy statement which would be the best thing to miss you I 'm unsure of the best mix of the edge but now as staff we 've been working closely with staff from jen rights office so Jane rights the parliamentary commission of the environment and she issued a report last year on his climate change and sea level rise and her staff are currently working on a report on coastal hazards and areas that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise so we have been obviously talking with them and supplying them with the specific information that we have and they 've been talking to us about the various policy options for approaching this so we we 're quite helpful that those issues will be surfaced and you know as you said before sunshine is the the open and get a lot of people debating it on the national stage so whenever their report you to come out I believe Lisa misleading but I 'm not Susan about their okay yeah yeah I think that would be a great thing because there 's certainly a perception amongst the coastal residents of our city that we are being treated as in isolation from the rest of the country that no one else we seem to have the problem that nowhere else in the country has it oh well cuppa tea district council found out that their residents felt exactly the same way which is why their residents took them to court and that 's why I 'm concerned that it 's been undertaken in an isolated way or a patchwork way so we are not the only council that is addressing this but we are the council they 're obviously our own residents focus on yes and as councillor Clearwater pointed out we live in a particularly dynamic part of New Zealand and we 've had a major event so we 've had we 've had the that has given us an acceleration almost of a hundred years of general rise you know just over the two years of that canterbury earthquake sequence yeah i make important at that point in the and the long-term plan presentation was it 's really that we have managed to kind of mirror and a measure of seconds the hundred-year productions around sea level rise that 's right so those those those the reality of the natural hazards have been thrust upon us in a dramatic way and indeed we 're still living in a period of heightened seismicity so all of those things are in our minds when we talk about things like the natural hazard strategy in the resilience strategy you all right so is that now the indoor it goes it us until resolutions label evil is it now or later on all right so what I 'd like to do is adjourn the meeting for a quick cup of tea I 'd like to acknowledge the president of mr. Galu Hashimoto a member of parliament from Japan who represents an area which includes our sister city of a cup of tea right _"

    "text": "in the amended version of the section 30 these are amended versions of that that are online at present there to start with the presentation we 'll just run over you haven 't had a presentation on this on the second part of the chapter since January so we 've done made quite a bit of progress since then what does this part cap cover excuse me we 've got floor level or film management areas our repair of land these areas were covered these topics were covered over and Lee in the first part of the chapter what we 've extended them further as you 'll see in subsequent slides repair of ponding areas which were we had policies all over this part of the chapter high flood hazard management areas we had those areas identified with them why like a really floodplain and the first part of the chapter we 're extending it as commensurate with studies we 've done for the second part tidying up a little bit of unfinished business and the slope stability areas and of course new coastal hazard management areas so for the us to extend the mapping of those areas over more of the notified zones primarily the residential zones with its identity into hundred years scale event for rural specific purpose and open space zones and we 've carried over similar provisions that exists for both the waimakariri floodplain and the areas around r-ky horror Lake ellesmere and pei wei villa lake full site and this is a map which is a little bit hard for you to see but if you focus and on the the the dark blue areas if I 'm holders pointer city around here west of the railway line a little tiny but sort of East but primarily west of the railway line which we 've identified and preparing the first part of the chapter that later data would help to identify that some of the new Walston data has picked up both woolston and a large part of the central city as part of Paul 's were identified and going down following on down to ones like elsmere KY hora as well and with new information gathered and the major flood events in the lake improve on the data we have their repair of Landis 's our information bits or direction under the this Sarah act and we 've carried those provisions over and we 've tried to streamline this part of the chapters you 'll see by cross-referencing to those provisions and the first part of the chapter ponding areas either naturally occurring once you 'll be familiar with a number of them around the city including Henderson 's basin in the hoon hay Valley in cranford Basin these areas have been recognized in the operative plan since 1995 we 've tightened up our provisions a little bit to reflect how important it is to maintain the storage capacity of these areas and this is a shot of Henderson 's basin I 'd say it 's pretty much a full flood capacity area and looking towards the hills here so you can see how important it is to have these areas to store the water and before they trickle down through the rest of the urban areas well I think primary this is all rural still rural land I 'm the bit that you with the the residential new neighborhood area abs or an AUSA sparks road would that be underwater as well I couldn 't answer that when Harrington who 's but again as part of that residential new neighborhood the update line development plan identifies areas first storm water storage and mitigation over to actually hold the water in times like this until it 'll trickle away and avoid a nun dating with digital areas you know it 's just really interesting to look at the context of all the new subdivisions and still that 's quite good reassured that we do have the area for the flooding to still go yep this will never change we 'll keep this won 't be as easy the council owns large part of areas of land there and then some of the filling provisions that we 've got our to stop filling of these areas particularly because they 're so important yeah maintain that strategic natural storage capacity ex front high flood hazard areas we 've had a few under taking that 's identified these areas that primarily if they 're in the waimakariri water that it can create a life safety risk to people in end damage property for the urban areas that 's primarily about the depth of water being deeper than a meter a lot of these areas coincide with areas that have identified both for as red zoned areas and also under the coastal hazard provisions in table 5 if you look at the copy that I 've circulated you 'll see there 's one column that hasn 't been completely wasn 't completed as part of the stage one chapter and we 've largely just try to keep a consistent approach and that column represents land beyond all those met areas that are mapped as either cliff clips rock fall or mass movement so that 's all the portholes and in the wider banks peninsula area coastal hazards you 've received your copy that still confidential they cut the coastal hazards assessment should have received that last weekend that 's being peer reviewed and we 'll come back to you with that review probably in another another month or so but that report has identified coastal erosion and seawater deal with tsunami as I mentioned earlier today we 're using a seat Annie work report to met Aspen tsunami for information only we expect that the tsunami areas will largely coincide with the coastal erosion areas so we 've got some restriction there in terms of intensification development that 's proposed family well I haven 't seen the maps overlaid we 're still getting it that information board on board but I suspect it will probably be both they 're all probably coincide with both those areas as do that the coastal erosion end and undated areas we 've met them both for the 50-year period end or so for the 50 to 100 year period as on the slide there but will you feel had a question the thing you know it 's really just choose to i understand it doesn 't really cut the report doesn 't really cover future likely tectonic change or up left or down sinking ya know i don 't think it does no because that 's that 's too uncertain really but it vechta Blee assesses the impact of accelerated see rot also got the acceleration and storm events or exacerbation and storm events over that at that time as well and that 's what 's factored into the NIV and inundation study has there been any you can iteration of land uplift over a period we 're on it forget which plate we 're on one goes under the other yes yeah well so is there any correlation between natural uplifted land n sea level rise I 'm not sure about that detail they certainly used the current lidar information which is a mapping of immense it 's about me using a lot of lidar information and we 've had no no correlation with the natural uplift of lens but there has been natural up love as a result of like if I 'm talking about natural uplift of lens through tectonic plate movement not so yeah it was just on that point yet yep when I was reviewing the MC the coastal has a report for one thing it gonna judge the stuff my miners see there was one thing a constant it 's all relative to layer yes although 's the long-term stability of our land best new zealand i have started making some inquires of that and I 've been talking to Markie ettin who 's a structural geologist very good repute so that the good news for North Canterbury is that the lands seems to be slowly uplifting however for us essentially because we 're in the basin of the the Pegasus basin it 's slowly subsiding now I haven 't got the exact rates and I don 't think it 's going to make a huge impact on the you know the relative sea-level rise but there is a sort of local differences there we could drill down a birdie from mmm North canter is basically going up that 's a structural component with the faults there and then the basin sort of the size dropping but I 'm just sorry just that 's an over geological periods so you know the rights would be very very slow it been millimeters over centuries will it pretty much yeah yeah yeah cell but might be I 'm being interested I 've been in two in have had think this as we are as counselors to will asking that 's coming or Christmas and a sense but the representation by deidre heart and the other people who made that from from the presentations that the end since then she 's putting out here paper their paper too and it 's called summed up a sinking city so I think that 's other sort of information which we as counselors clearly will take into account around these these issues of stuff want to comment on on that sort of part of the science there was an article on the priests about this number of them or a few months ago now because it 's it wasn 't just Deirdre heart it was co-authored by was it as you Huey making mark quigley yeah Matt Quigley was the name I was looking for so yeah so and it was a very good piece of work and it was good that it was in the public arena but I don 't know that enough people have really seen it so I think that we might and in the period that we the ministers actually advertised the link to the he came website that 's got that presentation on it because I think I mean I noticed in the nutria port yesterday that there were over 250 people had already gone to that website to have a look it 's the most popular link point for any of the new presentations and which means that there 's a lot of public interest in this and you know I think that we should encourage that public interest we 're going to have to have serious debates around these issues and people need to understand the science and we need to make the science very plain and simple for people to see for themselves because you know that a lot of the decisions none of the decisions we 're making them this area are political decisions they 're actually decisions that have got to be based on evidence in science anyway happy days here I 'm just moving along now to the next part here we 've got a snapshot from one of the planning maps that shows the lower part of the right you through now and if you 've got a couple of copy of the natural has a planning that stage three you can have a look at it in more detail but effectively this dark green band here represents their area subject to coastal erosion within the next 50 years so that 's on the open coast different processes happen in the within the history side of the spit and you can see the dark green band here is quite a lot wider a little bit hard to pick up but you can see it 's quite a lot wider here the light green black band is that area subject to coastal erosion in the 50 to 100 year period sometimes there isn 't a great deal of difference as you can see along here and the inner part of the spit now overlaid on top of that was a little bit hard to make out as the diagonal lines that represent firstly there 's blue diagonal lines representing coastal inundation during the storm event and the next 50 year period so that 's when water will go in and and then there 's also lavender colored lines that are very hard to see here the sum up here which will as coastal inundation and that 50 to 100 year period so if you look at your legend look at the map you 'll be able to work that out now what 's also overlay there which is probably one of the most prominent things to see is that as the polka dots and if you 'll remember back to the stage one chapter that 's those areas that are subject to flooding and a major flood events so that 's the the floor level and film management areas and the one thing that 's missing from that map is the residential red zone yes that would be useful to see where that overlays because it 's quite a considerable amount of the left-hand side of that picture thank you for clarifying that yes we do we do have some of the we do have some maps put together that show the residential red zone underneath that they 're not they 're not in the district and planning maps though I can bring those and yannis ask the question with the motor campers and I think it 's one is it off the map oh yeah that 's it sits off thumb it 's not off rocking horse ride this is rocking horse road yani it 's not Bridge Street yeah but it still will be covered by all of those dots and cross lines people in blue okay so if we just move along to another example from the becks peninsula area and this has met a snapshot from that 77 shiny the akaroa settlement so a similar situation here if you look at your map you can see that there 's a lot of the dark green color the area is subject to erosion coastal erosion sure inch potential shoreline retreat over the next 50 years now an interesting information that from our technical people they 've indicated that those areas also large are largely kind of like also a very similar to the floor level and fill management areas so effectively because of the criteria or technical attributes of the analysis effectively we 're identifying similar areas _''_987.16 from the work in that area but largely because of the as i said the attributes attributes that are used and that 's them i think that 's a fine that 's very useful to have that they 're something that 's quite considerable he can sort of see the dark lines there and i can 't quite make them out the diagonal line showing the inundation as well and not a great deal of light green beyond the dark green that 's the light green as the area subject to erosion and the 50 to 100 year period not surprising given the topography around the settlement but this is um that this won 't be a kind of shock to people in the area because this is very similar to the mapping that was produced in the stage one Tonkin and taylor report it had a lot of rehabilitation Smith 's 2013 that 's right so that 's the they obviously want effectively what this latest report that 's being peer-reviewed is showing us as a lot more detail as also drilling down to that 50 year time frame to a hundred years as we 've described before we think it 's really important to both sort of coincide with other legislation like the building that that provides for the life of a building for 50 years and it 's also a lot more tangible for us to plan in terms about strategic planning and planning for people sort of comprehension and be able to understand what a 50 year time frame would look like if there any time that we 're going to actually regard a 50 year horizon for a building is not sustainable you know I mean it just seems to me that if we 're really built I mean if the building access that we expected building class for 50 years I reckon that was done at a time before we had building materials that are available today I mean I just I 'm just just saying you know really it just seems to me that that 's not a sustainable outlook and a planning framework anyway she does read that question if we are planning for this for the 50 year timeline do allowed built in these areas well well did that is part of the question but that 's a that 's a bigger issue yeah that is partly what we are addressing in our rules of course yeah then we 're in what built as build back so we 're also not also yeah so these are not areas that you would want to have a lot of intensification or happening and and if you are building in these areas you want to be looking at your floor levels so any setbacks you know so so those are the things that that we would be looking at but fortunately the the mapping for the coastal erosion at all no sorry the mapping for the coastal inundation is is almost identical to the mapping for the the new among flood levels yes all all levels full management areas I 'm going to remember it and so if our f mas so I just need to FL to the old f mas so if our f mas will a pretty much lined so that means that people who are in the areas that are will not be in any different position than they will run when we looked at stage one so that you know they don 't they don 't need to worry that they 've got any more exposure than they had before might be additional in terms of coastal but it 's still the same as far as what you do to resolve against it which is to make sure that your fill and floor levels are appropriate that 's correct I 'm just reinforce that that effectively those rules still apply so their adaptive measure of being able to raise your floor levels that still there but what we 're saying if there 's subdivision proposed to create new vacant lots or new buildings beyond the footprint of existing ones then we 're taking proposing to take a much more restrictive approach and that 's for those areas that are subject to both inundation and storm events and erosion and the 50 year time frame for the 50 to 100 year time frame there 's a lot less certainty well there 's the high level documents tell us to plan lot can happen and that frame we 've also got the natural hazards strategy being prepared by the council that 's looking ahead to the future and taking an overarching viewpoint in an ideal world we 'd have that there to provide us with guidance but we 're taking a bit of a lead here and we 've probably sticking our necks out a little bit and saying we will still provide for some restriction on development in these areas but much less so until we really know what 's happening and it gives us that breathing space can I ask ask a question about with a couple of cases with the South you brighten area in conversation with them I 've indicated look you know you really do need to take this on board and submitting to Council and they have you there which is good but there is some kind of ambiguity when they look around them and see in terms of assets the ministry has now said well the South New Brighton school wouldn 't be the main place where you go and we 're putting in early bless it and now we 've got the conversation over the Moto camp so there is hmm fusion for them and I guess what they want acidity but they are certainly taken us on board with and those the various ministries are sitting around the table with us I 'm not sure about ministry for the education as such but certainly a number of the ministries are an informational be feeding back to them well i think i think the ministry of education should be sitting around the table because and i think Glen raises a very good point because it 's interesting the is that this is not said like telephones what what are the the the radio telephone network that 's made available for schools is made available in secondary schools in all of the schools that are along the coastline our primary schools so there 's just it doesn 't seem to be a I think they 're really does need to be some strategic thinking around the around schools and I think that I mean South new brightens the classic case because I mean I and you know yeah so I just and you do worry about decisions that are made i mean like when if the motor camp gets rebuilt that has to be rebuilt to these new levels so it 's not you know people just think that it 's just a question of putting back what was their essence so there 's there 's a lot of work to be done on on these issues and we need to we need to you know let the community know what they 're all about but in bed set they just want some certainty because I 'm getting mixed messages over public investment from yeah ministry with the school council saying this and thinking what 's going on so yeah well this is the strong table which is on room 511 you know we 're gonna page on the page starts on page 19 of the amended version that I 've given you but that the unamended version which is still pretty much the same for the is the same for the coastal hazard management areas that 's online people can see that they off earlier they may not if you look at the back of the boat brightens but you know the reality is that a little bit of area through here is the kind of like little islands that will be left should the erosion and inundation progress over the next hundred years so it is actually quite an interesting one if say for example the South great and motor camp that we need to address in the next two months do we actually need to plan when we think about it for the next 50 years or could we just plan for the next into 10 to 15 years because I mean these questions are going to come up for all sorts of redevelopments down here and there 's nothing to say that actually we do need to plan for 50 years for an asset like that so it may be that we can just think about 10 years out rather than a major investment in an area that features to find a line of reasonably tea and to lead people into the hole but is it and I agree with the new rules a repair doesn 't that 's a very good question though in the sense that generally the life of a district plan is about ten years but then doing the long term natural hazard strategy will give you a direction to move towards so that in your next review you can move more and more towards whatever direction it as the council wants to sit in that long-term strategy I think that 's true but that you know i mean it is a difficult area because a rebuild triggers yes the new rules a repair doesn 't and think what I 'm saying about people who are only repairing their houses they 're not actually putting themselves into a protector position against the new rules in a sense these new rules are an incremental step towards the future that still needs to be designed again finding that balances with that previous Iseman struggles that 's why we have non-human planners very true well objective I mean to know rather than then subjective and I think that the the other breeds the other thing is is that no 's right is that people make investment decisions based on the now and what is going to happen in their lifetime and what they can leave to their children so so they 're on a on a narrow framework around investment decisions but they are thinking long term for their children you know and and and thou wondering what it is that we 're going to do in the future that might impact on that decision so I mean you can 't make a short-term decision and i 'll just use the the park as an example because we haven 't made a decision there it but the couple that run it they want to know is it worth their while to make an investment themselves so it 's not just about the investment of public money it 's do you invest as a private investor in a facility when you don 't know what the long-term impact of the the location is going to be I mean I 've been out there after it 's been flooded and I mean we you and I 've walked through the flooding it is not an easy place to negotiate in that environment so you know all of these things have got to be on the table but I mean I honestly think that sunlight is the best disinfectant you 've got to get the information out there so that people can see that it is not based on a political one that 's being based on science and what is a an appropriate planning framework and and yes it can be short term but you 've got to have the long term in mind that 's educated one of the root words of education is to be let out well think in a sense we have to lead people into this they have to come to it themselves and also we must remember the purpose of the Resource Management Act which is sustainable management for current and future generation you 've hit the nail on the head and that 's why we use the term finding the balance yeah there is no set rule about how we determine these things but but we 're an agreement that we need to explain look long term however still has some rules in place at least for the next ten years I think this is the most important chapter of all but fell absolutely and I think people are saying to say what I was going to say in its some like we some of us had a discussion and it was presentation read with the community board and we would biggest this community board recently and it was really I felt really helpful it wasn 't_''_1791.91 all of all of us stuff but it was sort of a lead-in to this really and it just seems to me if we can develop a program and I 'm sure we will of what didn 't talk about education but it 's also just putting in the outlets discussions an opportunity for people to take it on board and think it through and that we start doing that as soon as possible because it 's the other part is you against their know getting a petition of you know six large number of people to keep to keep a holiday park well that 's not best outcome for the local people all the people who own lower they pay hmm I 'm yawning so if I 'm reading this correctly what what you 're saying is anyone that 's got purple hatching can 't_''_1834.33 have any new buildings no not what 's not complying basically Oh in the in the coastal erosion management area one in the coastal inundation management area one with your both subject to fix in the next 50 years as a more restrictive approach on subdivision creating vacant lots and new buildings so if you go back to that previous of it you know it 's a non-complying activity that 's what the NC is standing for and that 's not prohibition it is a very high test but it 's not prohibition out of what 's the phila to effectively the debt ruling would rely on the policies to provide guidance there 's no assessment criteria because their activity status anticipates that the only very limited situations where their activity would go ahead now you 've got to consider that in context with the existing use rights that people have their property they can still undertake it repairs and maintenance and raised floor levels but if they 're wanting to add additional buildings or if they 're wanting to subdivide their sites to create additional sites that often lead to new more buildings that would be very restrictive she took my limit for example from old ones through to my back to hardwood street do you have a met number there 39 this is an area the government wants us to intensify and I don 't know where we 've got to with the independent government appointed hearings panel but you know this whole area through limb load which is in this purple or diagonal difficulty shouldn 't be being intensified my reading of this map there can 't be coastal erosion its own little it 's not on the coast it 's yeah see I am I yeah I really need to apply some people we look at this coastal and a showing that 'll be exactly the same as the finished floor level so I thought that I thought it was when they were in both SI e right or wrong _"

    "text": "contaminated land on your desks there is an email from Marie Police co which explains about contamination land and the questions were in particular regarding is bestest but Peter can take you through their email good morning there 's two issues on Ann Marie 's email the first one is the contaminated land question and the guts of that the response and one there is that contaminated land is controlled through national environmental standard and that is administered by UK and that standard sets limits in terms of when a consent is required and so if for example in the last paragraph there more than 25 meters of soil as being disturbed then that would require a consent that is dealt with by he came the the first paragraph there also covers the fact that we 're safe New Zealand also has a role in terms of workplace health and safety and safety generally so what I what I wanted to do is have a consent mechanism where people when they do demolition have to get a consent to deal with the potential for asbestos so we just heard at emergency projects have issues with contaminated land asbestos dust silica we know that the Metro sports also was left with asbestos in it so the current system isn 't working so in terms of land use what requirements do we have for a consent to ensure that those things aren 't being repeated there 's a part of demolition well it 's both demolition and then defect at the end of the demolition that land is left without any testing until a new activity occurs so question we might have to come back to that one in a minute we need Ellen here for that one or injury so in my own distinct an be more stringent than initially environmental standard so we could say for a building of a certain era or a over a certain scale that it would require a consent for demolition and that conditions of that consent would be testing most at the start and at that yeah notice if the wailing comes because he probably knows but more Murray would probably be the ordeal person okay and there may be an issue in terms just move on to the second question which was the interface respect to reversing testaverde natural hazards and hazardous substances Murray 's outline their first of all that there are two issues one is reversing to tivity and that is the policy that has been proposed is to ensure that sensitive lean youth activities don 't locate in close proximity to either existing hazardous facilities or any areas where as is this facilities can occur so that 's the purpose of that policy the second policy in respect of Pease 's sources and natural hazards is that where hazardous facility as proposed in an area potentially if it to buy a natural hazard that it 's designed to minimize the risks that could arise from that natural hazard so for example then the second paragraph Murray 's indicated that if the hazard is in relation to flooding then the buildings have to be designed to be above those flood levels so moving to the previous question about could we include additional rules in our district plan to deal with asbestos and I 'm not sure you included demolition but I to relate it to the problem is is that I mean some buildings obviously under our circumstances of them have been demolished and while they 're being demolished or after they 've been demolished it 's been found they had asbestos so but there are buildings of a certain age that you kind of know to test wouldn 't you so I think the point that yarn is making is a good one which is is there something that we can right now rules that before you apply for a dim before you demolish or or or is it just simply a resource consent requirement that we have to put on not so much in our district plan rules but as required you know I don 't know which is the right place to do it because I think yeah is raising a good point the district plan is definitely not the right trust to do it okay there 's other legislation in place mainly through the building act so any building requires a demolition through the building act there 's also legislation through WorkSafe New Zealand through the health employment through the health board and then if there are any discharges to ear or whatever then that is triggered through the National Environment not the right place I know all there but up but but the truth is is that buildings have been demolished and and people weren 't alert the fact that they had asbestos on them when they started the demolition so well don 't know where do you put it on so there I mean unless it 's an a statutory requirement kit or can we create a bylaw that basically says that if you 're going to demolish a building of a particular age then you have to have it tested before you demolish some builders even though even an age you wouldn 't expect their vast business of fairways pieces inside the concrete yeah no no I understand there but actually really I mean but but there are some buildings where you 'd have to say it was pretty bloody obvious oh sorry pretty also this is coming to a duplication of regulation which we have differently told to avoid did not suggest i or not say I the answer to you is you 're quite correct right so but we 're where would we put it you have other legislation and if that 's not picking it up then that 's a matter for that to be dealt with through the other building act another legislation employed by don 't me the power to change the building it when i became there I know but potentially we can speak to building consents officers pets get some through the material educational material out there guidance and that 's the trouble is that people are being exposed to asbestos without any there 's no trigger you know and and there should be and I think that 's the point but I accept that it 's not here so we 're gonna take that away so else matter yeah then what are we doing in terms of contaminant have been in a distant place but what second time I 've learned section about so I think this has been talked previously your worship that can contaminated land is del through the national environmental standard those r regional council processes and I think we 've been through this before yeah wait here chapter so probably my paper somewhere but what are we actually notifying the consumer sorry i thought it was staged to look that we haven 't done contaminated lee we did do contaminated land as part of stage 2 this was just to follow up question yani we 've already been through it all right i feel like i can i can go back through to that chapter and send you the information so the question on the flat land recovery yes you asked with a lot the woods be the ability for councils who works along the banks of streams to improve storm water issues in provide the ability to remove stop banks of necessary yeah so I had a chick through the provisions of the chapter at that time and I also had a look at the utilities chapter which had a rule permitting the installation of stormwater infrastructure as a permitted activity so what I 've done is use that same role and put it specifically into the specific purpose wetland recovery seas the construction maintenance and operation of structures for the conveyance treatment storage or attention detention of water stormwater lane drainage water by the Christchurch City Council or network operator is permitted it 's good but what about wetlands there 's not infrastructure you know it is i just think that we might we might provide a more natural way of dealing with stormwater you know that the residential red zone gives us a wonderful opportunity to actually clean up what 's going into our rivers and therefore clean up our rivers so I just wanted to make sure that we didn 't have to we weren 't just preventing ourselves from from getting on with the job and absolutely yeah yeah that would definitely be the intense okay if I can do you think I can do tomorrow if you could play with a wedding on dead i think we 're we 're dealing with that after morning tea sorry yeah that was good and then the other one the about the ability to remove stop banks yeah there was the permitted activity p 12 the maintenance and repair oh great brilliant thank you Mike for that ability good work tsunami not being unnatural hazards checker good morning for young minds my name is we 've been a little bit preoccupied as you counselors are aware are getting the coastal hazards assessment finalized and focusing on the coastal erosion and storm inundation but we 're cognizant of the fact that there is now an updated report from near that environment can 't agree have identified in their website completed in 2014 November last year and we are proposing to include that as an information only there 's a disclaimer right at the start of that report that says because of the high return period and the order of 2500 years here that this report should really be used for sort of strategic planning infrastructure planning emergency evacuation planning so that 's what we 're proposing to do and we anticipate that it will largely coincide with a lot of the areas that are identified as subject to coastal erosion in particular and that the rules in that area will help to mitigate intensification in those areas over time and the first part of electoral hazards chapter recognizing tsunami both on the first objective and also in the policy dealing with the precautionary approach and there 's also a multi multiple hazards policy as well that as a result of some of the mediation that 's on gone on I understand it 's likely to be blended in with the precautionary policy so that 's where we 're at and we hope to bring that mapping to you unfortunately we won 't have it for today 's presentation but our people are working with me were to get the right information so we don 't do that yep no that 's good thank you alright so shall we move on to the but let 's leave the Heritage until after morning tea and move on to the city center okay I 'll just need to get Peter amenorrhea what was there is there anything else we could deal with beforehand we 'll know now we need to continue on with the resolutions although we do have a presentation on natural hazard we could possibly do that but we need to so we can either go on to resolutions now or it 's a presentation or have a break and resume earlier probably about full of an hour in your questions well the the morning tea won 't be out there yet that 's all I am okay so so would you like the presentation it 's one remaining presentation that you haven 't seen and that is on the natural hazards okay all right sure that how long will it take to get the tape five minutes or so to get to stick up everything five minutes yep all right so I take a quick five minute break and one thing I would add for the counselors infinite and meta mirrors that we have decided to send out we are able to send out letters to the land owners that have any proposed schedule item on the land with their it 's either an assessment or a statement of significance about that side you were concerned that they wouldn 't know until the time of notification when they received a directly affected party later so we can do that in leader because obviously the stage three chapters have to go to the ministers but just with their the assessment the report behind why their item is on the proposals yeah I think I mean I really really appreciated the breakdown i thought it was much easier to kind of you know get a overall picture of good where things were going so that was great but I just and I just up I didn 't have it I 'm gonna and I didn 't bring them down with me because I don 't get them printed out I and I can 't look at them on my phone but I looked at them on you know on the computer upstairs last night and I couldn 't quite get my head around how many how many private building owners are there on that list okay yeah and would you like it we do actually have hard copies printed off that email and all the attachments that was sent out she last night if you 'd like a hard copy of them I wouldn 't say no to a hard one yeah 't want to kind of hold things up either okay all right five minutes people _"

    "text": "ah Brigitte come back you had a series of thumb answers to questions they wanted to flick through yes correct I 've invited Scott back to speak specifically to fire stations and Community Corrections facilities and residential areas within the 4 f 's that was a question that wasn 't specifically answered the other day thank you morning um counselors the enablement of emergency services facilities arose out of the phase one or shall we say stage one residential chapter hearings that have as I see I think last time I spoke to I indicated that they had closed last Friday they were enabled as part of a crown submission that sort of that sort that essentially service stations and ambulance stations being able throughout the the flatlands owns that was in response to or that was backed up through the stage one strategic directions decision that set policy 13-point sorry three point three point 13 where it relates to emergency services and public safety and that policy which is now operative objective sorry that is now up to opted of reads recovery and provision for comprehensive emergency services throughout and the water required for firefighting now they are at the moat and the copy of the rules before the hearings panel at the moment and obviously these are only before the hearings panel but the hearings has finished they are they are permitted activity now this relates to a the new strategy on behalf strategies on behalf of the fire service and the st. Johns Ambulance Service where the fire service is looking to establish two new fire stations and the flatland zones and areas that will give access that will complete a comprehensive access of fires of fire services or fire response times across the flatlands and then although I note that of course there is now the new emergency or emergency and services facilities being built inside the for revenues at the moment and hindsight I question whether or not these need to be enabled inside the for revenues at this stage given that given that that those stations are being constructed I suggest at this stage at least in the version that goes to the of phase two zones phase three that goes to the minister services facilities not not included in terms of Community Corrections facilities this this this is once again enabled through or was enabled or sort through the crown submission now I 'd like to and that relates back to the now operative objective that I read to the council a couple of days ago that was that the objective three point three point 11 where it relates to the expedited recovery and establishment of community facilities and educational activities to meet the needs of the community along with that before the hearings panel came a a new definition or about a while it was covered in the community first facility definition loosely a more direct or what we might refer to as a belt embrace definition of Community Corrections Facility was included and I 'll read that out that means a building used for administrative and non custodial services services may include probation rehabilitation re integration services assessments reporting workshops and programs and officers may be used for the administration of and a meeting point for community working groups so I like to stress that and in the discussions that I this matter they they they stressed quite strenuously that there 's that this was non custodial and when I questioned them about when I questioned them about matters such as periodic detention or periodic detention centers they said that they weren 't included because they did not fall within the definition of of non custodial services I think that their tivity status within the for revenues as still and my view warranted as its as it 's been described to me by the Crown 's planning consultants that the the outward that the buildings themselves would be outwardly like any other non-residential activity within a residential building and so when when they were drafted earn as I said when they were drafted and that was I was mindful of what was coming out of the of the hearings panel but as I said a in hindsight I don 't think the emergency services I don 't think that the emergency services facilities permitted activities is required because of the the axis that the facilities inside the for the new facilities and southern for Center for every neutral gov but I facilities given the size and nature appropriate um was that definition change brought to our attention what 's different about community facilities including corrections centers though that came out of the stage 1 hearings and did we accept that as a council you I accepted it as in terms of my role through responding to to mediation but I don 't recall us ever being us for a direction on that but you 're not necessarily once once the once that the submissions have closed and the feather submissions the council no longer has a further role then it goes to the hearings panel for their processes as am part of the processes before actual hearings are clear sometimes during hearings there are mediations with various parties and as a professional we are required to attend those mediations and about that but you do come back to us and check with us that 's what the purpose of the you know the sort of two to our meetings has been as just just just flick through things that but as I understand it that isn 't always possible it 's do come back yes but when you 're in mediations decisions have to be made there and then that 's why we 've had meetings sheduled every wednesday and every piece yeah i just want to understand so busy what you 're saying is the stage one hearings community facilities which can go into residential areas is permitted activities and i 'm with no notification or that 's the Community Corrections facilities and the kingdom community with the steward that doesn 't include heating centers that 's right so I 've to I actually took comfort from what we were just told not so so I 'm not concerned about it well then just help me understand difference between a PD center and a community or Corrections Center like what 's the corrections into the modern day yes because I 've never heard the distinction before in fact would be probably like I 'm source be straight foundation or or like a probation office where you go and sign on that is exactly how it 's been described the probation officers work from that 's how it has been described is different that 's where people tuned up for periodic detention and essentially sent out on work gangs and those ones are not appropriate for residential areas they need to be on high-profile streets with nothing to hang around to do they are taking it technically in custody in preparing for this morning I also I check the Department of Corrections website for the description of periodic detention as well and it is very much as and it is very much as the mere described it it is also a custodial sentence and they were view and it 's very clear and the and the definition they did is non custodial services yes thanks that 's great right yeah periodic detention work gangs yeah so there 's still be serviced ourselves till we courses I mean did you look back at like stem road and and intuos road at see the level of concern in Swords road was was an appropriate location stanmore road wasn 't so and that 's the trouble is that there isn 't an easy way to describe these things I call technically it 's an to provide for these these services and the rather directive nature of the objective and stage one and the and the statement of expectations in terms of simplicity if you like on balance I found that this was the the best way to address the matter while addressing probably the the higher end of the community concerns around periodic detention centers by not enabling them or was a PD singer was it is it right so the one that Corrections had in the central city I don 't know but we can come back to you with any of that historic information to do with resource consents but so they currently have a site in this intro say that 's in a non residential area who does sorry the restrictions as I understand they had a PD center and peterborough street that didn 't cause any eggs anyhow and it was that it was fine but I don 't understand why we 'd allow that to then go into a residential area yone else who I heard we sit at the fire station yes I 'm yelling and in terms that non custodial services are not enabled I 'm sorry their custodial services are not enabled the definition F inition specifically says and does not include or reading it again means our building user administrative and non custodial services now periodic detention centers is that being described to me by the Department of Corrections and planners are a custodial or a custodial sentence Andrew Andrew and then fell I just have Android them feel great thank you um just to clarify one thing that seems to be a little bit of a disconnect to me we 've just had a conversation about a place where work gangs gather which this is is not and that those type of work gangs been seen as a temporary custodial period one of the things that you mentioned in your original outline was a meeting place for community work programs or words to that effect and that is included in the definition that we 're talking about so I 'm just keen to know what the difference is between a place where work gangs gather that 's considered a temporary custodial period and a 't turn up at voluntarily as I understand it from the Department of Corrections website once again that under work community work sentences a an individual is set an amount of community work that they have to undertake they 're not compelled as to when they undertake if they have a set time table over which they 're in a number of hours that they that they need to meet and that they are not but they are not compelled to turn as i understand it to turn up to the to the meeting point if you like on any edit one particular time that can go to the they can go to their there they can go and collect materials they can go they can convey that they can come and go as they as they want if they were working with others they can meet with others then so in that sense it 's non-custodial so that 's a community work centers so many work groups your community work groups and what 's the difference between a community work group on what was described as a work gang mean is your seat is that from what i understand Scott has just said is that in a PD Center all of the people that are on the periodic detention work group have to arrive at the PD center they are looked after by whoever as an authority at that pd center and that person is with them until they go off-site and then they come back so they are there on site whereas the community work groups it sounds to me like they could have an arrangement it might be one person it might be several peoples say perhaps via community work was two arrays graffiti or something like that they can meet at the site there is not that need for somebody to be looking over their shoulder the whole time they just have to register the hours that they 're working all right I fell what was it sort of answer what I was going to say as a form of formation officer actually but in let the other thing point I 'd make two is that since the since the boat you know huge I guess the processes that we use by Corrections there 's no there 's no yet in my mind now that Corrections have an approach certainly in the city where by they Sunni approach the community board they did in their case and who would know then fact one of the pd 's into any XO and so I think the processes are much better now and I was quite satisfied with the definitions and how it might you know it sounds much better under I mean that the pages roadside you know it 's the complete opposite of the experience down the other end and the pages Road site originally Corrections wanted to locate their pd center and hampshire street in the local community said no i mean it 's an appropriate there 's that there was a bar there at the time there was you know there were all sorts of reasons why people would hang around afterwards and that 's actually the problem offer Main Street no visibility and actually a concern to the whole community and justifiably so so we went looking for an alternative site tragically it PD cinders been completely destroyed but the point that I was going to make was that the complete difference there the local residents association leaflet at the entire neighborhood with a positive message about what it would mean for the community and how it could be made to be safe and how they could do work in the community for the community so a completely different approach very positive very upfront and no secrets or anything like that so I agree that Corrections have not handled it well in the past but this approach was completely the opposite the big sleeve isn 't Association where I happen to love it as well I was a member of the Association and the pics the residents association was invited to the morning tea for the opening completely different approach so you know I think that the the type of collaborate collaboration with local residents associations local community boards and the community board were there as well so everyone was positive about it and it all started with them choosing the wrong site so it just does show that they 're not appropriate people to hang around of stay but they are appropriate on very visible main roads even though they 're our neighbors around if you approach it in the right way so but I you know the decisions been made in terms of the definition the definition is before right the hearings panel but but it sounds as if everyone 's an agreement that that 's in a pro priate set of words that 's correct right Corrections website there 's not a single mention of pd centers anymore everything is called Community Corrections so let 's not fool ourselves I think this is semantics and this is a way of getting things in so you can just look on their website and find a PD center in Christchurch there is none there are all called Community Corrections centers and none of them are in a residential area not a single one is in a residential zone as I understand it from looking at that list so why would we lie on this to be to go and head into a residential area in the city yeah II can I ask website Department of Corrections anyway the thing is that the thing is asleep a question was asked the question has been answered can we move on to the next question do we want to leave it I mean hell no no it 's nothing there 's nothing to feedback we 've been advised what the situation is that 's what we asked for what as I understand that we have to make is whether we support PD centers and community corrections going to a residential no we don 't we 've just heard you just are you saying that you are not accepting that the advice that we 've just received from staff that pd centers are not included no this is that for the stage one definitions we 've been stuff done and for the non central city 's being decisions that what we made what weaving asked for two are notified districts plan also you know saying are you saying that the definition for every other part of the plan will be different from the one we 've just had described is that what we 've been told decision to make around p dissenters in communicating first no we haven 't_''_1236.58 we haven 't been asked to make a decision about meetings were doing the Central City chapter not about PD sentence we 've just heard that the definition doesn 't include detention the question was relating to fire stations and and Community Corrections facilities is permitted activities in residential areas and the city center that was the question right and you wanted to understand what that meant area is zone at the moment you are referring to pd centers no I 'm referring to Community Corrections all right so what you can vote against that that 's fine so it something we move on to the next question we 're not doing it now and we 're just dealing with the questions and then we 've got the resolutions for city center the flatland the grandpa base and coastal environment do you have a an agenda the agenda with you hear the agenda in front of you it lists what we 're doing so now we 'll move on to the next question _"

    "text": "to get this Arthur balance building beats building whatever it 's called out of the way first and I understand staff have a new recommendation and if you 'd like to yes resolve a table that and then we can resolve that and move on so the the other bandits building was formerly a group for and only the facade was listed so we 've reviewed the listing and considered there 's new information about the loss of the internal staircase and given given that loss in the leg of the ability to inspect the other interior elements which are essentially the ceilings which were noted in the listing the evidence doesn 't really justify extending that listening beyond the facade so we would like to revise that listening to list the facades on Colombo and casual and it 's worth noting that there there 's no other example in the central city where we have extended our listing from a facade to an entire building Bravo with chief we 've checked the listing so this would have been quite unique if we had proceeded yes yes yes and the be listening the facade and those elements have been lost to the interior we 're going to revise the listening from high significance to significantly so and that that matches really the McKenzie and Willis facade which is again only the facade yeah and is listed as a significant problem so that that 's what we were revealing I just clarify that it 's the existing component of the facade so what is currently listed because the area below the veranda is not currently listed and is obviously subject to major alteration in their retail design that 's going in what we 'd prefer to do is list the entire facade and then with the owner and downs of what is done on the on the facade so that it is in sympathy with the building be so there are elements on the below the veranda there are listed at the moment there are three separate elements a star mart shop the old star Matt shot and there 's two signage areas that are in the facade above the veranda is listed that 's what we just leave it as put in shops on the ground for the ground floor will change and is the imeem and all the planes that have been published you can see that the ground floor changes quite dramatically is listing it doesn 't mean no change there 's no there 's no prohibition on change and we expect all heritage buildings to change over time can we just leave it as it is please just don 't extend the the facade don 't increase the area of the facade what with what we 've got of the facade fine leave it as it is but just don 't touch the ground floor no it wasn 't it wasn 't even listed so the the ground fall was not listed as heritage facade the area above the veranda is the area we currently have listed as heritage facade the end the elements on the ground the two elements and those other elements yes so the existing ones fine absolutely fine so we are keeping the elements so on the ground floor that we listed yep yeah that 's right what we currently have we keep keep the myth this marble staircase has gone the ceiling needs to change to to bring it up to engineering standards and it actually gets a glass than an act which features some of those elements of the ceiling yeah I 'm just makes money yeah if there 's any other comments were hearing stuff about impact of of it of drawing it up during the pan out that way now well the inmate will be it 's not consistent with any of the listings in the plan in terms of our approach where there is remaining heritage fabric and that may include changed heritage fabric as well we 've listed the whole building if all we 've got left is a facade with rusted that whole facade that 's our approach we haven 't listed bits and pieces unless there are only bits and pieces remaining such as the Theatre Royal we have listed the facade the dome in the marble staircase because there 's simply all that 's remaining good so could we just list the bits that are remaining which were the existing heritage components and actually in 2001 the top two floors of that building were built the century which is really unusual to be here at each other of thought the facade would be listing is the heritage visage not so just there okay so we 're not listing the entire exterior of the building anyway no oh so we could leave off the area that 's not currently listed below the veranda from my perspective is getting too finely grained I 'm not comfortable I 'm happy that we take the whole thing off because it 's not going to change that the exterior of the building is not going to change in the areas that are currently protected I would like to protect those because I think they 're a significant component but I what I don 't want to do for a plan that 's already in our resource consent area and already publicly released is stuff up the entire retail development that 's going there so I 'm just not willing to do that so I don 't want true to list new components of that building so I kind of new recommendation I thought that you were recommending that the current listing although moved from category for up to one of the other categories remaining categories I thought you were retaining just what was there now so I hadn 't_''_387.72 I wasn 't alert this issue of the additional coverage and i 'm not sure what the implications are but it 's just worth noting that if there is an existing consent that has been lodged there are no implications will that consent so that consent will be dealt with through the district play at the operative district plan because the consents are dealt with according to the rules that are in place when they 're lodged yet but I thought that is it of that so it 's not the same as trees so it 's not it 's hot then we notify him but I thought come up date on the conceit situation and so as I advise Wednesday there 's a certificate of compliance and forth great investigative works and a sign of duplication and to those of the applications that we have currently yani I think so can we get that legal advice I feel very uncomfortable having this conversation without the legal advice that we were going to get around these sensitive issue well we can 't_''_504.11 do that in public well can we go to PX and can hear it well I don 't know well I mean the lawyers aren 't available right now but the trouble is that the legal advice is there are elements of the legal advice that can 't_''_521.57 be dealt with in public that that we can 't take into account in our decision making well I don 't know because I haven 't seen the advice I just noted last time we wanted to discuss this we were told we couldn 't because we needed to get that legal advice I said I wanted legal advice I 've received legal advice staff have come up with a proposal which I thought was going to be a satisfactory solution I wasn 't aware that there was this difference in relation to the existing protection of the facade so and I don 't know what the difference is and existing consents are covered by the existing rules but we hear they 're actually the consents aren 't necessarily the consents that will be for the full development so look that the issue is is that that 's not a proper basis for a decision that we 're making under the RMA the proper basis for a decision under the RMA is whether it should be listed or not and what I wasn 't clear about when staff came up with an alternative proposal which I thought would be an acceptable one to the council I didn 't realize that only components of the facade were previously protected and I guess I 'm looking to staff to explain why the whole of the facade now needs to be protected or the historic part of the facade needs to be protected when it wasn 't considered worthy of protection before I mean what is the distinction because it actually sounds to me like administrative efficiency to do the whole lot rather than a specific argument about protecting the whole so perhaps if he could respond to that so in the preoperative for Lister listing and it 's through my understanding is through the submissions process for that plan that this agreement was made to only list parts so when was there 90 when with rid of plants notified in 90 95 95 right opposite clean so just the same owner at that time who made a submission and negotiated their reduced listing right so and so what 's different now well we 've come back full circle really where the Heritage professionals have looked at the building assist it on its merits and come to the conclusion that the whole facade should be listed the Heritage facade not the entire exterior of the building right so we could say the the 19 what imitation is 19 duty razor so there is two stories of the building on top of that which we 're not listening right no right so why what makes it different to not list the ground floor as well I mean we 're not listing the entire exterior anyway even though that current the top floors had to be built in sympathy with the building absolutely fine wood five tours you want to go to three out of five floors neither of them is the full solution and one of them stuffs up the development no no I don 't want to hear any discussion about the development well it is not an RMA consideration can we just focus on that issue the first part of your question is perfectly in order the letter is not so I 'm I 'm hearing that it as administrative be efficient for the council to list the whole facade I 'm not hearing what the differences between the the agreement that was reached back in 1995 which was acceptable to the council then why is it not acceptable to the council now just to retain the coverage of the areas that were previously agreed what we 've been trying to achieve is the consistent approach to heritage assessment and we 've got a new methodology and criteria and thresholds so we 've applied that to all our heritage buildings but you applied that back in 1995 an agreement was reached not to cover the whole of the heritage facade an agreement Heritage expert advisors that you are didn 't agree with the decision that council made but but wearin we 're in a position now where we have to look at whether this is an administrative convenience or whether it 's genuinely required you know under under the sea stances whether it 's genuinely required it was a category for listing of the two components plus the above veranda so what is it that makes it a category two for the whole of the that that section now the category 2 is effectively equivalent to categories three and four in the old plane right we now only have two groups if so in that sense it hasn 't been promoted as it were although in fact it is of higher significance now given that we 've lost quite a number of similar buildings yeah and I think I can understand that you know that you know so we 're so the the listing of the entire facade is in except for those additions that are set back on the upper floor is is really about influencing the development of that entire with the with the other elements that are present and those are those are the elements of course that people see most often from but it 's given given that the protection of the current the current protection enabled that to a cure isn 't that sufficient protection for whatever happens in the future that 's your decision well yeah but I mean that 's what I want to hear advice on so what is it what is it about adding more coverage to the listing that would provide or what is it about just leaving things the way they are you know at category 2 but the coverage points at the existing coverage what is it about that that doesn 't offer sufficient protection for that arm facade then then the council would have no say and no heritage and put on whatever happens on their ground for for those other elements but we 've never had a say over the ground floor does greed so what we 're protecting is starbucks the entry to a basement which doesn 't have an accessible a barrier free entry we 're when that bus exchange went in there we 're protecting things none of which happened in 1938 all of which happened in the 90s and 2000 's and all of which were pragmatic responses to 2000s and we 'd be protecting that I should explain much more clearly that we 're a Heritage listing doesn 't mean that we are prohibiting the any change so we 're not protecting a particular element from any change what we 're doing is through the resource consent having an ability to influence that change and and make sure that it is sympathetic with the entirety of the heritage facade so it 's it 's all right that it 's a subtle distinction if you like it does it does imply protection of heritage fabric and heritage elements can I just point out in the minister 's later some of his expectations are that we minimize the amount of planning red tape this is a development that is underway and that we are at seriously and I know seriously seriously it 's not about the current development okay we have to facilitate a speedy building becomes central to an overall development plan for that retail block and I don 't think we want to slow that in any way shape or form and we want to ensure that crash which is a place where people want to live work and vest and visit now and in the future and probably shop as well and that means some changes and I mean that facade has to change we recognize that the bus exchange has shifted for example so the entry to the bus exchange is no good the basement element will change it has to have good accessible access to the exterior that that garage door is a heritage item seriously that carriage door had no more heritage the mind it 's it 's an obscene piece of work it 's horrible it 's just dust up and II may become worthy of protection them maybe that 's why they wanted yani I think I think it 's really important to recognize it just because it has a heritage less saying the ability that gives is that when things are proposed to be changed the about the impact on a significant meritage building so if you go into the statement of heritage significance what you find then the typical interwar commercial furnitures are now a rarity in Christchurch since that we 've quake this was recognized as having higher craftsmanship significance for quality of a surviving decorative features particularly plaster ceilings canopy detail in a bronze medal and granite shop shop fronts it also goes on to talk about you know it recognizes that not all of the below the canopy the original shopfront remains but there is art deco materials of bronze material and polished stone that do remain well that 's that 's my reading of the Heritage assessment well I mean that 's what 's on the assessment so and starboard that they live in a daze are they existing coverage well I would have thought I mean I don 't know staff will know better than I do but there might be some elements in there under the canopy yes here are elements that are already heritage accepted they 're already in our category for that they 're not there are is one party under the canopy area that is protected no problem no problems so probably so you know I don 't understand what what 's different from the staff assessment to what they 're telling us that they want us to let could you tell your research components of starbucks yanny no no no no it 's not it 's not for a conversation between councillors it 's really for you know what are the elements of the of the area that you want to now list that weren 't previously list that you want to protect so previously below the veranda the only elements that were listed was the the shopfront that Starmart was in yeah and that that had those bronze metal sections and those red light windows the decorative metal panels that you were talking about and there are also two metal display cases on the granite faced columns right so those were the elements below the below a brenda so what else is what else needs preserving and that below the veranda so what only our perspective is you 're talking about the the fabric heritage value like the garage door you talking outdoors definitely NOS vintage we 're not saying that its heritage value what we 're saying is what 's needed is to look at the building as a whole and what if we change further change you might make to those areas with a heritage fabric or not can affect the reading of the whole building and its overall heritage significance ya know I can I can I can hear that and what I can 't see is that you can 't protect you can 't protect that by protecting what 's there you know like what you 've already covered gives you the basis for that conversation with the developer well it doesn 't because there are whole areas of the ground floor shopfronts that we wouldn 't be able to have a conversation with the developer about so so they would put in a resource consent for changes in those areas and and that wouldn 't affect the heritage the heritage part of the building but if it wasn 't listed they may not need to put in a resource in any way a heritage item so let 's assume that the building has to stay largely as it is just because you 've got it because you 've got to protect that facade and it 's assumed to protect that facade then that whether a start at starbucks comes out in another shop goes in with a much more interesting entry way it doesn 't really affect us does it in any way shape or form as long as it doesn 't defeat those significant heritage items the rest of that ground floor has not got a heritage but in it so why would we pretend that it has or why would we I 'm trying I 'm trying to understand that you know that the question about you know what is the what is it about the ground floor that 's heritage that that needs to be protected and that environment I mean oh you know I think counsel is the potential for adverse effects of what you do in that area on the remaining building because the ground floor shop fronts are part of that building which but and that 's already protected so it can 't tip but yani for to put a something has heritage value it has to have huge value sure the two floors above it have heritage value they 're being protected the existing walls are remaining can I touch base on on the rules for a moment in terms of what I 'm sort of trying on for what Michael Stein and they do allow for a level of flexibility and the application on a case-by-case basis looking at what is the impact of particular proposal on ticular parts of the building its relationship to other parts of the building so it can be seen in the round so I think it 's important to to Amanda st. covered it in the round of that building so there would be a conversation and application to see what the impact would be on the proposal and the level of detail of the Heritage assessments and I don 't post it to the detail of this but it hasn 't gone into the very fine fine Greg every single building at the point was exactly the position in 1995 but the council negotiated a different position as a result of the submissions of the owner of the building so now we 're going to introduce another change go back to where we were before but that but we haven 't_''_1564.65 we haven 't got a submission process for us that goes to an under pendant hearings panel on the council it 's a measure of they 've done review in 1995 and now we 've done we do a new review based on your information what is available but it 's exactly the same decision against the new planning context but it 's the same time same decision same decision I mean nothing has changed the Heritage experts know that this is a heritage building and in the wind and they wanted to list the whole building but as a result of the submission process a decision was made by the council only two lost parts of it and I want to know why we would want to increase the coverage of the existing building when we don 't have a process like don 't know I suppose it can go off to the minister like this and then the minister will come back and say take it out but I don 't think that that 's a comfortable position for any one of us I just don 't think that we should be yeah up I mean I 'm sorry I really didn 't realize that you hadn 't come back with just in it leave it as of those position um so um it 's going a bit around for its no one 's fault no but I thought you 'd see it that on the ground floor there 's some areas that we would want to keep and if we don 't they 're already protected their it okay so can you just sort of clarify what and I 've got a picture in front of me what one of those features are they the pillars or what what can just remind me again what but what we 're talking about okay I don 't have a full inventory of every oh I feel honest I 've got this just it 's the what was the start colombo Street shop front and that his that has a number of elements involved with it and in addition there are two metal display cases which are mounted on the Greenwich columns so those are protected but I think that we should be clear what protection it does end does not mean if you 've got I don 't know if you 've got the the listing the statement of significance in front of you which is the photograph of the the updated photograph of the beats building and if you 've got that in front of your spare copy it 's with it 's worth noting that the ear bridge is obviously a new element and that new element interfaces with the old 1930s facade so protection the protection is not no change it is not thou shalt not to touch those two floors that are original heritage fabric there there is change and that changes managed through the results consent process so so we 're not saying and we are an element is protected thou shalt not touch it and we you like the the approach to heritage is much more holistic than that and that is why the recommendation is to list the facades certainly and as a whole and then assist any resource consent that comes in for change and then provide advice to ensure there are not significant abuse fix on the remaining heritage februari and how that building reads as a whole that 's right and that 's it back that and that 's a very good example of what you can achieve yeah through our results consent process because that was a very good example how strikers Genesis along their talk with the with the facade and it was set back from the remainder of the building so it does it reads as separately and it took a long long time to get through as did the air bridge I remember the air bridge debate I remember very well the school debate and it takes a really long time in terms of getting things happening in the city what we are what you 've wanted to protect the start those those cases all of those things floor of the building which I know very well or in the basement actually how we protect in the basement we 're not saying we 've said three times that we 're not protecting individual elements such that any change is prohibited what we are saying I understand that the listing enables through the consent process an assessment of adverse effects on the whole so it 's it 's it 's not about it 's not about elements that 's about the building reading as a whole _"

on that we don 't even get to the side where the buses go so we get to build the subdivisions approve the subdivisions do the roading through the cycleways through the footpaths do the bus shelters but not where the buses go and for a city for any city its public transport is so and making sure that the city works as a whole that people can access all sorts of facilities within their central city so having a rural Authority unelected at the moment and in this proposal half elected that spans from kaikoura to the bottom of the white a key determining the public transport routes for christchurch city and into a bit of so on in a bit of Womack is patently absurd there is no logical reason why we would want to continue with a system such as that the only reason that we can 't allocate the bus functions is because we own a bus company and actually allocation of public transport within a city is so fundamental to what we 're doing so if the government must continue with only a half elected again then it is absolutely fundamental that the urban transport function rests with the urban authorities that is Christchurch why make and so on and tomorrow nobody else is affected by those so why they would have a say in it especially as they 're unelected I have no clue it makes no sense to anyone the other one is the other urban function that is again urban and that 's air pollution so each of you know how much time you spend on issues of odor and air pollution in your ward particularly odor that ironically rests with the Regional Council again the people why techie really don 't care about the smell in your neighborhood but and it 's really important that the people who are affected by a problem deal with the problem that these are our issues not somebody else 's so for it can to retain the functions of urban transport and air pollution and odor is patently absurd we can go on with that if the government can 't_``_261.22 do it as we say in the submission within the time frame 4 2016 minute needs definitely to guarantee that it will review it prior to 2017 or whenever they can get it into the legislative time frame yep I 'm Phil well yeah I think Vicki 's put the case very well and I think it 's a really good submission very strong submission and it outlines their concerns around neck of democracy but and like it it wasn 't in a way to a wreath report it all becomes clear in fact how a little actual representation we as a council and then a rate paths actually have when it comes to the regional committees that we are dutifully sit on and help make decisions even though clearly Christchurch 's the lad is a large majority population in this Canterbury region and I guess the other thing that stands out for me and we sort of know this it 's ironic that in fact in this option there are no options that are actually in front of were doing if we were consulting with their people with our people of course will be required to have options under local government teacher that 's what I ironic because they 're all sorry I don 't want and and it 's really concerning so I 'm really well I 'm really pleased that that report is so well written and also what 's the case very clearly in squiddy 's thinking thank you I was just actually desperately trying because I wanted to get Doug Martin 's comments on the record because he had a he had a specific reference to this that I 'm just desperately the scrolling through his report but when he did his final report on the the consents department he actually did raise this whole issue around governance and the region and he raised it really in the context of you know like would you have a single single Authority and he said or not not now you know it 's just that 's not the issue but actually there are issues with this should be any beach and public transport and said that Christchurch and a little bit of why Mac and Selwyn was determined by the Regional Council makes absolutely no sense whatsoever so I think that we should get Doug Martin to write a report for us yeah but but anyway I think that that the point of the submission is really focused on on you know the inadequacy of the options and there is an irony that it is a review of a structure of local government and if it were the local government organization itself it would by law have to produce options and it 's so it 's absolutely ironic that the government is in fact producing one option that I mean it 's not an option they 're producing one proposal and that to me is not good enough so I 'm a great believer and no taxation without representation if they want to have a split council part elected part appointed like the DHB they can fund it like the DHB yani thank you for the submission I just think 6.1 is really the important point councils view is to return to a full Democratic model the basis that according to the discussion document the commissioners have achieved their task so I just think it 's really important to emphasize we are calling for a full return to democratic democracy you know in our city and in our region and that really is the key point I take from the submission I don 't_''_491.02 I don 't want the government to think that we 're in any way okay with that fundamental principle of democracy in our region but I accept that the staff and other councillors have put an alternative governance models for a worst-case scenario but I just want to be really clear that this council did not support what happened to e can the elected a Ken there was letters from the mirror and there was things done by the chief executive or the acting chief executives to support the removal of the alleged ekm but it did not and never add a full mandate from the steamer critically elected council as a collective and I want to make that point again to the government because in this document they again repeat what supported the the destruction of that elected ich m which is certainly not the case never has been and is certainly not going forward so thank you to the people that have done the work on this submission I think it makes a really fundamental point that hopefully we collectively endorse we now city has lost so much in the way of democracy I think calling for a full return to it as the least we can do very good all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I 'd like to move that we now _"

    "text": "very much the next item on the agenda doesn 't look like other items on the agenda and that 's because it 's a report from me so this is a follow on from the council meeting of the twelfth of februari where we resolved to adopt the median plus option for the establishment of a development authority at that meeting we asked the chief executive to bring a revised funding model back to Council that would minimize the impact on rates and so this is really the funding model that is being brought back I think one of the issues that I 'd like to highlight and hear that perhaps isn 't as obvious in terms of reading the document is that the the funding of it is is is repayable to the to see CHL so we 're not talking about money being made available to the to the developed world development Christchurch an order for it to be sunk cost it 's actually about making that money available so that it is able to return that money so it 's by way of a loan and that people were but concerned about committing 25 million dollars in the initial phase or 4.5 with 1.5 over the three years so my proposal I 'll be perfectly happy to accept that we have 1.5 million over each of the next two years and and then we can review the whole process as part of our annual planning process next year I think that this is really important and I guess if I mean if life had been different and we had brought on quarter mentha and they hadn 't established the extent of our financial problems and that we hadn 't had to look to bring on cameron 's to look at our management of our assets I think that we would have set up this last year and we would now be reviewing a year 's performance and so that I guess the the circumstances that we inherited has left us a bit slower off the off the track that I would have liked but I think it is absolutely vital that we get this up and running there are a number of things that are going to 're talking around transition with you know the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act due to expire and April next year so that 's that 's a year away and I think that we as a council have to be put on a put on a footing where we are we are seen to be and absolutely committed to be I 'm doing things differently and actually seeing ourselves as playing a catalyst role in the redevelopment not just of our city center but of our suburban environments as well so I mean New Brighton littleton some these are all areas where there have been proposals signum there are areas all around and each of our wards that would actually benefit from this we 're looking at Bishop tell the other day in relation to the redevelopment of the bishop dale library there 's land that 's made available by that it starts to look more like a development proposition when you 've got an agency that 's able to separate itself from the normal process and see itself as maybe redeveloping a component of the of the mall down there and than the will the result of the contribution of the land is bigger than just the sale of the land would be and I also think of places like you know the old Convention Center site which we 've taken back into our ownership from the from V base we can sell that piece of land we had a couple of people you know sort of proposed different options for buying it but when you see the development potential of the whole area you start to see that the that now I 'm going to get this wrong it 's the whole as bigger than the sum of the parts and when you can get a you have finally got it right when you can finally get an a mechanism for what is normally a council process suddenly moved into a process that enables all of these different opportunities to be taken then you start to see that we can really catalyzed growth not just an hour CBD but and the wider community as well I know that that well I know personally that the people of New Brighton will their ambitions because their ambitions are great and they end in great in terms of my support for them but also great in terms of the extent of what could actually be delivered there and it isn 't just about ensuring that that the ideas are able to be brought to fruition it 's just that it enables people to have a mechanism for raising good ideas with the council but not having to come to the council and then us having to go out and get advice on you know the unsolicited proposal they can go straight to the DA they can put together a proposal and Vienna can come to counsel with all of the advice that we need so I 'm very keen to see this up and running I think that the sooner that we get onto this the the better it will be for the city and I think the city will welcome the fact and I 'm sure the business community will welcome the fact that the council sees itself as playing more than just a replacement for what was there but a catalyst be so I don 't know if anyone 's got any questions or comments you to move it Paul lonsdale mousse well well o le Cheyne 's still second right okay and yeah for questions if I may all of which relate to democratic oversight and governance and it 's really just checking in that I 've got the correct understanding of what I 've read from the report who are we directing these questions too well I suppose me it 's my paper right thank you and I might have to call on others for assistance so I just wanted to check that the statement of intent would be subject to approval by the council yes there 's all projects and desired project outcomes will be subject to approval by the council yep regardless of where they come from so they might be projects that are instigated at the council 's request or there might be things that land at the DA that then come from our approval that would be the same in both cases it 's right the the DA itself won 't be able to initiate and then bring a recommendation to the council and we as a council can refer projects to them yeah now that 's that 's all good board appointments both initial board appointments and any changes to the board can they be made subject to final approval by the council yes as I understand it the CC HL would propose the appointments but it would come back to Council for sign off so that would be as a matter of course yes yep great and then my final question relates to reporting and I think given the obvious interest that we 've got in this area and the need for it to get up to speed very very quickly and councillors obvious interesting the type of work is going to be doing and also I guess give them some of the concerns around oversight and governance I 'd like to suggest that reporting happen monthly to the strategy and Finance Committee with a fuller report every three months so face to face sit down every three months yep and it 's just possible I think that that 's a good idea to a monthly written report correct yeah so I 'm really reported in a report of full quarterly quarterly okay so the the reason that I think that that 's a good idea is that this is not a BAU model so this is not something that the council has done before and I think it 's not unreasonable to have a reporting regime that connects the council to what is an arm 's length development her agency great that 's fine so I can take the answers to those questions as read in the document we 've got before is no need to note anything alongside the resolution no but I could I 'm perfectly happy that those items are noted I 've got that I 've got all four of them written here so I ok to start hopefully no damage note yeah that 's great thank you yani um thank you i think you know i know you 've given us a lot of information but my understanding from your resolution as you 're really wanting asked approached the search our around the establishment and so nothing either world in or out I mean ciaccio might come back with a different model or a different structure but that we 're really asking them to come back around a is it well no we 're requesting them to capitalize an existing shelf company I mean obviously there 's been discussions with the with the chairman and the chief executive yeah we 've spoken about this at the board and we 've spoken to the chief executive and the chair and they 've been involved in designing this process to make it a straightforward as possible right right it 's just that there 's a number of things in the informal information that we 've received that I don 't_''_646.97 personally agree with but but at some stage we 'll have to have a discussion about what 's it or what 's out all the different accountabilities well we signed off with previous paper on the twelfth of februari and they 're that determined a number of the factors around the establishment of the Christchurch of Development Authority what this does is give it a name development Christchurch and 're asking see CHL to catalyze so a number of the features of the of the medium plus model that was proposed have already been signed off by the council so that will be referred to cch oh right okay so the things that were talked about with injury when some of that stuff wasn 't part of that and was quite deliberately not part of that medium plus option so we had a light option a medium in a million plus we already signed off on the radium + option + and so that 's the core of my question as even though we 've already signed off on that option if there 's a number of other things that we want a meander were included we have that ability once that report comes back from cchr no no we 're thumb we 've already determined the structure of the company and what we 're doing now is catalyzing it as we were requested to do so that the council already decided back in February what the model would be like and this is the this is the funding and balances that I think on balance are acceptable given that we are moving to a new model yes I understand that my concern is a number of points that Andrews raised which you have agreed to include are different than the medium plus option that we 've already agreed to so I want the flexibility to be able to incorporate those when it comes back rather than being told we 've signed up on a million plus option and that 's what it is now we 've signed up on the medium + option and we are accepting I mean that none of these are inconsistent with the medium plus option they 're not inconsistent none of them argue oh I have a different reading of it but I 'll take tell you on there and if we need to change it then I guess we can we can do that I 'm just the other question for me is around the funding so I 'm concerned at the level of funding without any kind of budget is it is it possible to request a budget and look at that I think that we will we will have an opportunity to review this and the annual plan as I said before I mean to get the to get the company up and running it is important that it has a basis for hiring staff for bringing in there probably consultants rather than permanent staff and many respects around some of the individual projects that we might refer or which might be raised with them so I don 't think that it 's important to review that right now but it you know in terms of how long this takes to get up and running I think we 'll be into the round for the next annual plan and and we will be able to review whether we need to add to it or subtract to it at that point so my concern without seeing a budget is asking cch I 've approved 1.5 million of funding for an organization where we don 't know what projects is right but see CHL has already talked you know see CHL have already discussed this and they are more than willing to the idea is that that money will be returned over time and yeah it 's just around the extent of the money that we 're putting in which is about one person on rights maybe a little less and so it 's a trade-off between the other things we want to do in the financial challenges we have as a council no it 's not because the other things that you want to do is to spin net money this is lending this money so it 's money that will come back it is not an alternative to a rates reduction and I think that that 's this this is a much preferred model from my perspective than the one we were going to consider last time which would have had a rate some page so before any money gets spent do we have any other ability to sign off on them once we can see the budget and what the costs are well I presume that the cch oh I mean we 've got a statement of intent to sign off so I 'm not too worried about that the of how that will apply with respect to the budget but the statement of intent will actually lock down what it is that the development authority does for us and what the money spent on yeah but each project is referred by the council or approved by the council yeah okay I 'm not sure I well I don 't know I mean I 'm now looking to members of the ball it doesn 't it doesn 't matter cch all will come back with a proposal for you yeah we 're going to prove I think they will need to come back with us establish from horde or the actual budget is how it 's going to be structured and then I come back again facade all right okay so if you mean a lot a money up front that has been repaid then we should perhaps put put the word repayable or something in the earth I mean that 's what you 're talking about if it 's not what you mean in what you 've got there is can we put the sleigh can we put not profits come back yeah that 's the whole point so yeah its equity I think you don 't want to confuse it with loan that makes it more complicated for the balance sheet so its equity that hopefully is repaid over time as it actually generates it is over time it 's not like a loan yeah leave it till then right so okay so that 's been moved and seconded sony debate you have a question yep all right did you all do you see any what are the parallels with the chip that we 're setting up okay not not all good okay right any debate Andrew thank you um yeah I certainly am welcome to this report and in particular I welcome lee suburban as well as the central city context of this area 's like sydenham Littleton New Brighton their obvious contenders for the attention of the new da questions have been raised over governance and I fully understand the arm 's length nature of the relationship between the DA and the council and plus the potential for conflicts of interest and and perceptions at a commercial vehicle the governance concerns for me a largely addressed by the the four points that we 've put up there and the council 's ability to approve the membership of the board the statement of intent the project undertaken and their outcomes and then regular and detailed reporting back to the strategy and Finance Committee and obviously to the council through that committing I 'm hopeful that the DA will do a lot more than just delivery of the council 's suburban master plans or the council 's and key project anchor project I 'm hoping the DA really adds value and brings about work that otherwise wouldn 't have been able to to happen so my expectations of what 's going to be delivered a reasonably high and I 'm hoping that you know what we see is is everything that we 're expecting from this this organization certainly if you look at projects like you know various projects in New Brighton where we 've got funds already committed through the the annual plan the long-term plan whether the DA could unlock some some issues there to one that I would like to see little term we 've got an issue there that I 've talked about on a number of occasions around development economics and privately owned small sections where the intervention of the Development Authority quite possibly could unlock that Sumner we 've got a huge project in the form of the summer library which if that was to be looked at through a different set of development eyes we may see opportunities for combined residential development commercial commercial interface at ground level and so on or we may not but at least this some this da gives us the ability to explore some of these things and bring about outcomes that we might not otherwise otherwise have seen so the need for this I think it 's fair to say is is well canvassed the need for a single landing point is definitely acknowledged and that 's one thing that will represent a huge improvement of having one da that becomes a single landing point for people that want to invest privately in the city and really this is bringing about a body which the city center so I mean this is the vehicle it 's the project that it 's going to bring about that I really look forward to yeah Jimmy I supported the mayor 's the recommendation we stir into the four-pointed the reason is the first timing because I still consider in order for the regeneration of the city 's urgent because why after favorite 2011 us wake up to now we are aware not only in central city in the city while still quite a few la project of the facilities in a year still you need to be the kind undertaken either repair or rebuild so regarding timing is my particular concern second is in the last year I was taught by quite a few the potential investor in wisdom even from region for nationwide off on the intonation they all have a strong intention would lie to partake of these the rebuild the city if we lost this opportunity that opportunities knowledge us to stay in there we need to consider windows maybe we 'll know more after this opportunity third one is because of this regeneration in the CBD by HR is the city why but is less very important because we always mention oh right your virtual city city but H approaches not only in the central city but also need to consider the suburban area even the rural area when you consider this kind of appearance osito the first the pointer you based on the males that revise the financial situation 1.5 million dollars x 22 years 3 million dollars and also if they create this new development that the kind of the hydrates are thority you can create the penny free free vector to the inner city HHO HHO so HR is small investment or we can get a huge the the response huge the benefit we need to consider coaster in the effective they need cause it and also you based on the bathroom in here regarding the league or the comments in here particular mention actually in principle we back to the favorably of this either the meeting minutes answering daytime principal the of the counselor we supported Easter development the authority only request the CEO primping as regarding to the will need to focus nada the printer so the pace on this the opportunity timing scope of work financial impact impact comment and also with the Angela four-pointer put into this recommendation so I fully support these the the the mayor 's recommendation the poachers you need to pull on need to move on rather than just stay in there thank you okay Paul I welcome the development authority think it 's something that 's long overdue and I think the council taking leadership in this space is actually really important we 've got a massive job ahead of us to rebuild the city and and of course some we were told you know early on that investment is going to pour in from overseas and I was going to land here at Christchurch well that s something hasn 't happened because it 's difficult we 've been very lucky that we 've actually had Christchurch developers or they 're now actually developers they weren 't developed for their property owners had actually rebuilt many parts of the city and now actually reinvesting back in the city however we 've that is the biggest threat we face right now as capital moving to somewhere else rather than Christchurch we know that capital moves every day I see that this vehicle will allow capital lamb land here in Christchurch will be coordinated with their own efforts so I think that as a council taking leadership in this in this space is really really important I think that it will actually highlight to the rest of Christchurch and even New Zealand that we are standing up and wanting to make a difference in the rebuild of our city so I 'm going to fully support this here and get it behind it and it 'd be great to review it in a year 's time and hopefully we 've actually made some really good games and movement and our rebuild our city at David thank you I just like to make the point i think that i think this is a great move there 's been the perception and the city that all the development is focused on the CBD and a lot of our suburban areas have been left to their for our suburban areas to really flourish and particularly when council spins quite considerable sums on suburban master plans they are aspirational plans they 've got no statutory obligation and I think that we have now a mechanism where the aspirations of the community can be picked up by this development of authority and given some impetus in their suburban areas so i will be giving my full support to this motion Oh tell sorry look I 'm going to support it too and I have to say though I have some reservations about supporting it which I 've expressed and I think though that get the the lens answers to Andrew regarding regarding some of the processes the checks and balances that that gives me some assurance but I think that those processes in terms of reporting they 're more than just acceptable they need to be more than acceptable to us as a council I think they 're actually absolutely necessary I think it 's clear and the report in the comments from our CFO that in fact you know there is there are some issues around future those are the things have to be taken into account we need to remember that in fact that the money we will obtain from christchurch city holdings in effect is ratepayers money and we 're responsible for that so I 'm supporting it but I think it 's essential that in fact the the new entity that it remains responsible to counsel and especially because there are some big projects involved and like I 'm IM that because we 'll be reported in a project-by-project basis and in that way I think it 's workable so with that in mind I will support it yeah Jamie yeah I 'm very supportive of this um the most pleasing aspect is that I 'm really hard to see that it as a council and this someone 's gonna blindside me here with butter and have it slightly different tone to their speech and we will seem to understand the situation we 're in we really get that it 's not business as usual this is a really big shift a paradigm shift for how not only our council but councillors in general is an entity that 's going to say we recognize that and we 're going to transform ourselves around how we get things done it sir it 's a transformation of Bruce Jenner proportions and it 's it 's very very different and the framework that we 've had in place just does not work the sort of things that we 're lacking right now it doesn 't take a rocket scientist to find out that we are incredibly low and hotels we need have hope to need to have hotels here but the structures that we have in place and the investment proposition just isn 't really attractive enough there 's no real strategy around it and we can 't afford to be waiting any more time to just hope that it magically works itself out that you know the fairy godmother and Vista you know from from offshore it just simply isn 't going to be tipping in the hundreds of millions of dollars unless we can really have a coordinated effort that is not business as usual that joins things up perhaps liaises development auckland and puts new zealand link approach this is bigger than christchurch because you know we 're kind of small fry and least we can have a coordinated intelligent approach to it we 're going to muddle round forever and we 'll look back in 10 years time or 20 years time and my kids will be saying to me when they live in another country somewhere else or you know what was it like in Christ which I want to know the Christ restore because I want them to love Christ Church as much as I do and still be here this is about creating reasons for us to have a really really rich future as a city we cannot afford not to do it I caution against doing it on the cheap from from from the start you always pay for it more in the long run so please be cognizant of the importance to do it properly I think we 're on the same page and it 's stuff like this that that really reminds me why I 'm so excited to come along to a council meeting at this 'm getting accreditation back hiring a great CEO creating a viable financial strategy probably the most three important things that we 've needed to do the fourth is this it is a little bit too late but hey we 're doing it now and that 's as good as it gets for the situation that we 're in so let 's get on with it I back it it 's early days but this is this is the big one of what the stoom is going to be about its of defining defining an initiative yani thank you I 'm happy to support the resolutions going through today recognizing that we will have an opportunity to approve the SOI which will include also the expenditure I do think it 's important that we look at a vehicle going forward you only need to look at the relationship in this building in terms of the deal that we did as a certa ETA see why it would be good to have some other body looking at these sorts of major investments to make sure that we don 't get called into deals that we 've done previously as a council with private developers whether it 's car parks or whether it 's Civic buildings I do want to make the point that I think is really important though with with her to call for us to you know sell off our libraries and we have been open minded in terms of what we 've looked at but when we got the library report council ownership is the most cost effective and has the least impact on rates because leasing from investors have higher whole of life costs and larger impacts on rates developers require margin and investors require 7.5 to 8.5 yield and the cost of borrowing is higher for them than councils plus you get the ongoing rent increases so I think we do need to be cautious around just how much of cultural facilities go into this development agency this is a need to get things happening in local areas that aren 't currently have with the private sector and all the government sector actually if you take the example of housing new zealand and the complete lack of there 's huge potential to do things in a different way in a more joint up way that actually builds communities builds back local businesses and builds back I think a better environment than we had previously so I think the concerns for me are there this can 't_''_1978.21 be seen as a top-down structure this can 't_''_1980.25 be seen as telling people what to do it needs to be community-based and cooperative and move cooperatively forward it needs to avoid the duplication we have a number of agencies whether it 's the airport cdc ccd you invest christchurch all doing stuff in this space and i think it 's really important that what we do doesn 't duplicate what 's already there i also think it 's really important we focus on making sure that we 're not just funding a whole bunch of expensive overheads on consultants directors fees CEO salaries more community more communications and engagement salaries or we 're actually much better that that money goes direct to those communities and to those projects rather than be tied up in expensive consultants I just think we as to how we get the best investment of that money but I think it 's really heartening to hear that this is hopefully be similar to our social housing and that it 's not having a rates impact it 's actually about creating a self-sustaining entity that can do things for the good of the greater good of the city so I 'm heartened to hear that that will be a really key focus I think it also shows the value of actually retaining our strategic assets that enables us to do things like this through this process which is a real positive and it also enables us to use and I know in the report we will still have to comply with the Auditor General 's public procurement policies and I think that 's a really important point to note because it does give us that accountability and transparency around how that procurement will happen and just want to finally make the point that there 's been a lot said that things haven 't_''_2088.309 been happening but actually you know again we need to make sure we have DA does and I appreciate that those projects will come in front of counsel for decisions in terms of whether it should go ahead or not but if you take the convention center and the hotels actually I believe that this council if our blueprint or not obligate our central city plan had been adopted when it was we 'd see hotels being built people want certainty and clarity and the rebuild about timing and our plan actually gave people that so I don 't if there 's some criticism and these papers that council can 't_``_2125.21 do certain things and and I kind of disagree with that think actually if we 've been able to do our things without the the top down approach that was put on us then actually you would see hotels investing because they knew where the convention center was so you know I think we do need to balance up the need to have this independent board or independent da at arm 's length doing things versus what we can actually do ourselves when we have control over it and that 's hopefully through adding these additional things happy to support there are the thing that 's being put forward today recognizing that I am concerned about the cost thanks very much look I appreciate the quality of the debate today I think that people are seeing this is an incredible opportunity and I understand people 's concerns about doing things differently and and and taking taking a bit of a risk and use some risk aversion and the local government sector it 's a it 's pretty much alive and well but we have to take this risk because in my view it gives us the opportunity to do things that we wouldn 't otherwise be able to do and I 'll just I 'll make this point to you but there was a lot of discussion around the setting up of the central city development unit with an Sarah and when Sarah was set up there was a lot of advice given to central government about inner city regeneration authorities basically and I actually went and visited all of them except the Beirut one and every single one I spoke to told communities when I met with the guy that used to hit the London Docklands group he basically said that the biggest mistake they made was to develop a piece of land as if they didn 't have any neighbors and the minute they started talking to their neighbors that development took off and so anyone who has a concern about this not being embedded in a community a process can take comfort from the fact that international best evidence is that it 's the best way to work so I you know I do think counselors today I think that we are going to see a bit of a stick change and that 's what people are looking for in terms of the council that does provide us with opportunities that we haven 't had before and if we don 't take those then we 'd be living a serious crisis go to waste just a paraphrase so i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very very much _"

    "text": "Chrissie Williams welcome okay I would like to just talk briefly on behalf cancel staff just to say that with the natural environment recovery program we have a six month report here and you 'll see that the the program of work is matured considerably in that time and we would like to recognize the great work that Chrissy has done for managing the the nerb ends the excellent job that she has done hands with a lot of the work now maturing in becoming integrated into the council 's operational work that means that obviously there has been a review about with the project managers role in that and Chris his time has been scaled back down to half and FDA 's so that is really pleasing to see that the the programme of work across the agencies is really working well and obviously for council there are still big challenges ahead around matters such as stormwater the land drainage recovery program working also with the storm water management plan program of work where we are working towards a comprehensive stormwater dis judgment scene for our network across our lodge with he can at the end of June this year so there 's a lot of work with council staff closely where they can staff and on a lot of important matters around the the storm water issues that are facing the council obviously I would also like to to touch base on the fact that the NIP has come to a point where it was quite timely for Chrissy and others to organize six seminars which were held from februari through to april i think it was and they were very well attended those seminars between seventy to a hundred people came and i know that a number of you also attended so those presentations were a great opportunity for the community to get an update of what is happening in the natural environment and those have been put as videos up on air cans websites so people can actually access them quite easily and get all that information which is which is great so from a council perspective it 's really pleasing to be part of this program and to have chris 's support and where she and make those linkages for us so i 'll pass another person thank you clay thanks for those comments and mine are similar and that i 'd really like to acknowledge the collaboration that 's across all partners for the natural environment recovery program is still continuing just with this requirement of my time to lead it because there 's klyber 's cedars its maturing and business as usual to board and enter existing programs of the various council so that 's we are sledding and our preferred option for transition is that the natural environment technical advisory group of or what maybe by a different name would sit under as an advisory group to the to the utes of that 's where we end up with an transition so there hasn 't been a natural environment of advisory group under the UDS prior to the earthquakes and we see that as an opportunity to continue that partnership and collaboration so that there 's three parts of the report there 's a report that Clive 's talked to on pages 111 213 which is a highlighting the city christchurch city of which are works that you 're continuing with anyway they are reported on the colored sheets on the next few pages and i 'm Peter answer questions about those but I don 't plan to then speak to any of those specifically and then we 've also included the report that went to the recovery strategy Advisory Committee on the seventeenth of April and as cloud said that refers to the updates sessions we had in the function room here and really grateful for the council 's use of that room and the staff that helped make sure those happened with setting up the Roman and also making sure the IT was working at various stages so the plans now is that for two days a week and will continue address addressing the collaboration will continue reporting at a three monthly rate this is a six monthly report just because of the Christmas break and we 'll continue working with various community organizations who are participating a number of the programs and and some of those are groups who 've got aspirations for projects within the residential red zone technical information they might need and that the rest of that process is being led by Sarah issue where so I think that 's all I we need to say and happy to do the risk by Christians metamen yeah I 'll just comment on the successions I haven 't been able to get to them but the feedback that I 've had has been really really positive and I just noticed you 've got the number of views on YouTube and the earthquake changes to the coast and Esther intensified by sea level rise that 's a hugely important topic for us that the council with the district plan review so I know that we 're going to be referring a lot of people to that website over the next wee while as we get ready to notify the second part of the natural hazards chapter so thank you very much for making that happen and I understand this to be another presentation for counselors and and commissioners in the near future Ellen by montano meet about that yesterday great two thoughts a plant of it yep yep hopefully on page 116 on eight just really concerned at the third bullet point the waste water network model has been updated to include skirt with this is the color age using flow monitoring once skip work is complete in a comparison will be made Crete earthquake model blah blah blah results will determine if consent compliance is achievable or whether a new consent will be required and then it goes on there 's a risk that the wastewater nitwit rebuild not sufficient to achieve equal or better than pre-birth quake overflow frequencies and volumes so was just really worried about what that means for us and what 's being done to mitigate that risk I mean I can comment that there was an existing consent for overflows there was then a variation or you can seem to apply for by the City Council before the earthquakes post that earthquake there was an agreement between the cruise ships that he counts on Environment Canterbury bit the enforcement of of either of those consents would would not happen and for a number of years and that expiry date of that as 2017 the situation book will be reassessed depending on whether appear as end in what the modeling saying so yes there may have to be another consent applied for but I think that 's something that will assist them as a situation at time and probably so many staff coming more than ok so my consume was that um we 're not going to know until the school it 's finished and then we 're going to end up in a situation where we can 't meet our concede so I would have thought that it should be some intervention now so that this week we can be reassured that the skirt work we 're doing is helping us make that consent rather than leaving it as a big risk until the end but maybe we could get a replica economy when we 're dealing with the Alba meters under 13 on page 117 I note that it says that the council has called for exhibitions of interest to the use of pirate Park which closed in the fourth of March and we 're going to advertise our intention to lease it 's probably more a question of our CEO or our staff I don 't recall us making that decision in fact what I thought was we would put on hold any decisions about the red zone we did um because it 's not fun that 's where is that just understand my eyesight 's not as good as it used to be so I 'm just really concerned that there 's a community expectation that we 're going to have a sports park on for a park and you as a council we haven 't_''_571.5 I just don 't be concerned and this has been raised previously how we 've got so far down a process without us making a clear decision that 's so that 's a really good point this looks let 's get an answer to that not now no no okay not under the knee no final question from me is just um on page 118 under 14 one two three four bullet point the W EMT has worked closely with Syrian si si tu to enable land remediation and construction works in the central asbestos demolition waste and dust management now I 've previously raised the concerns over the Metro sports but I am concerned to be again reading problems with the anchor projects in this regard given that these issues have repeatedly been raised as a concerns i 'd like to know what are those risks and issues that have been identified and why are they continuing to be repeated on these sites that are controlled by sarah and ccd you don 't think that I program coordinator that 's down low it 's really good other patients that you want to have followed up yeah and I appreciate the information that 's contained in this report and again I just think oh thanks to Chrissy and to provide for the whipped up done around around these reports they 're really really good reports but can we have a process to get those answers particularly around them those those active projects well why don 't we have received the natural environment recovery program progress report for October 2014 to march 2015 and invite the chief executive to report back on the issues raised yep that 's fine for all councillors I just wanted to emphasize though that the waste environmental management team they do report provide a regular report to the environmental transport infrastructure committee and so dead as dead as available and has been part of our regular of our regular monitoring as a council to so the information is available and we can ask particularly ask them questions when the report comes to counsel I considers that every time we get a new report we get highlight of these issues and they just the same issues new project and so we 're just repeating we 're just repeating constantly being told is initially it isn 't issue there 's an issue but these issues are reoccurring and I 've got significant health impacts okay so let 's list the issues that we 're going to have reported back to the next council and it may be just a reference to the report the latest report to your committee so they are the the first ones that consent so they consent issue is there a discharge consent it 's what what work no I understand what the issue is but I mean I 'm just identifying what the issues are it 's the park park and the e mt report on estas asbestos demolition waste and dust management yeah denta fine yeah so what are we doing to such as well the thing is is that will will we know what the three issues that have been raised our and i think that 's that 's very useful so Vicki on item 12 the community gardens and food forest is ethan actually putting any funding internet i know there 's a joint group and i know there 's a food resilience network but is there any funding coming from again no none okay okay so um would someone like to move and second this report paul lonsdale seek and up Phil clearwater i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

anyone want to second this is it going to fail for want of a seconder David East right so who do you want to direct a question to the advice that we 've received that said that we could put a mechanism to enable the easement to be brought to who to be extinguished and that obviously the applicant assess might reconsider their their position but you know i would give in favor of having their ability to extinguish that easement if we needed this for a footpath or other public works so i would like to see something put them to that under the conditions and i just wanted the appropriate wording from staff is to do that and whether they raise that with the applicant or whether they need to go and say look here 's what council that ok so if could do gum come and answer the question as to whether the council would have any right to require the easement they removed or would it have to be granted in perpetuity it doesn 't have to be granted in perpetuity it could be granted subject to a limitation that would be unusual and it may impact on the the applicants ability to do what they wish to do because if they wish to expend money forming a right-of-way they may feel reluctant to do that if it if they 're right could be removed and they to to take the improvements away but it can be technically done but why would we want to do that in this case when he 's going to be building her right away cisely but it 's it 's a matter that 's been raised by so our boards dealing with a number of issues on the hills where we have a lack of public road space because previous councils have sold off road reserve we 've now got kids going to school Mount Pleasant that have got huge safety concerns and we 're constrained because unfortunately a given permanent easement over and we now have a really complicated situation that if we want to improve safety for the school we 're really limited sorry so this site X onto the school um sorry I can 't see a picture of it so I don 't know I don 't know why this property needs to be treated differently from others I understand why others so just tell me why this easement you 'd want to remove it after the guys put in the right of way so so what may happen in the future school might explain community seem to might go go there it is next to a reserve there might be new housing developments there might be a whole bunch of activities that happen what we know what I know from the work on the hills is with the construction that 's going on in terms of the earthquake rebuild and the you know the population at school at the existing school there are a number of areas where we want better footpath access for safety concerns and we don 't have the land available that land or granted easements over it and it just means that in the future if there ever was a need and it might be unlikely and that 's fine but we have a way of getting that land back for the public public purpose that it was actually harder originally your community board or any granted the right-of-way easement so we 're only being asked to exercise the Minister of Conservation power to consent to the ground of the easement so did your community board make this a condition of the us we asked when it came here for them advice well that 's not something that we can do as a I mean what why would we do it I can 't_''_260.69 I haven 't seen any advice that says what you 're saying I mean I would you want me to get stuff to give advice on that was in school and the current writing problems were facing in terms of foot parfait sorry I said to you I can 't see a map no but where is this an association with Mount please I don 't we just defer this to another meeting because I mean I can 't make a decision if we have to I thought we were simply exercising the minister 's delegated decision-making on a honored easement it 's already been granted by the community board but the fact that you personally asked for some advice on whether it would we would have an opportunity not to grant a dhampir Pacioretty council might that request that 's that 's why it was deferred from council has come back to us and the information that we 've had is that we can have a condition in there where if we needed to we could extinguish the easement and all I 'm saying is given that we 've now had that advice that 's something that I would favor because of the safeguards it gives us going for so it was this an item that came up while I was away I can 't recall when it came out it came out in August last year oh sorry I forgot phobia community board chair comes and we just put it on the next community don 't we tell me and you know and can we get some particular advice as to whether that makes any difference to the to the individual concerned yeah well I mean are we have I honestly don 't know if the council asked for this advice to be provided I can 't see that I can 't see why we would yeah the only comment I would make mad amir as the application was made some eight or nine months ago the staff recommendation is the easement be granted it 's it 's a piece of reserve land I understand from and I 'm from relying on memory and I may be corrected by the community board or the counselors from the ward but I understand the the piece of land is is part of the reserve which is not used not likely to be used it 's a steep part of the reserve it 's it 's a surplus portion of the reserve as I understand and I may be wrong but you 're correct the council is only being asked to to guard the consent of the to the board and the board has made their decision so the staff would request i think that the decision was made today if possible yep as the concern with regards to access on Mount Pleasant that if there 's an easement that we cannot put a footpath across that easement is that this issue surely our staff can work with this of the gas to the easement to gain a strip of land or whatever in the future or whatever that is required of earth but we never a footpath will require that we did the ability I don 't know it seems to hold the salt the community boards agreed to it if the question is protection of a strip of land for a footpath whether it ever event rates are not then it 's that that 's what we should be looking at with it not the actual grounding of the easement so all so that it 's about the future excesses and that 's what Yanni bits what you 're talking about the possible time an area that that for whatever reason there was some deal to put a you know ideally a footpath through the editors state and it 's probably expensive but in terms of the kits they 're currently you know walking on the road which is really dangerous so it just it 's really around a safeguard for future if we if we need to rather than disposing of it permanently which is what this easement does and it stops us having to use the Public Works it rather than then say kind of done stopping the whole thing can we not give the easement with condition that we can put at the she better than I thought path in some stage but can I can i clarify we 're granting a right-of-way easement that would not prevent the council using the strip of land for for right away purposes the right-of-way easement isn 't granted it doesn 't grant exclusive rights their rights in common with with the landowner so a right-of-way easement to this particular owner would not prevent the council sending children down that pathway to connect with a walkway okay what 'd ya have Paul the community board so we as a community of a water agreed to allow this to happen this has got me at this for a site off yeah that I mob that few myself so I 'm going to pop that also I 've got a I 've got a mover in a seconder I 'm going to put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Lord no can you record that from yonni johansson it scary thank you natural environment recovery program progress reports _"

    "text": "the number six points success interference between team have I read that wrong 2.5 which is within the GMT measurement but the point that was the stats that would just read out related to what are said to be deaths or illnesses and hospital admissions related to smoke from wood versus should national guidelines be prepared the council considers it important that the air plan be reviewed to reflect the guidelines now if the sentence above says it appears in Christchurch particular no I know what it says right but then it says should national guidelines be prepared we recognize the flexibility and adapting to increasing technical understanding of the sources and unpack some contaminants for example at present there are no national guidelines for PM 2.5 although it is increasingly recognized as a significant health issue that appears in Christchurch particularly during winter etc etc yonkers a national guidelines be prepared the council considers it important that the airplane be reviewed to affect the guidelines yeah I understand that but I 'm questioning the stats and the number of deaths and admissions and a point of it but you be prepared we 're not submitting on this we 're just saying that should national guidelines be prepared for this and I am I reading it wrong no that 's that 's great yeah I 'm not disagreeing with that I 'm sorry I don 't get your point we can you 're referring to the to the to the to the state that 's referred to an item sex as being out of date but it 's not submitting on the air quality plan as it is it 's just simply highlighting that if there were to be national guidelines prepared for PM 2.5 then we would have to that beer plan would have to be reviewed that 's all number six is saying but it 's also saying that the main source of wood combustion no it says it appears in Christchurch that the main sources would combustion that 's for PM 2.5 and it 's saying that if if national guidelines are prepared I mean it 's just simply saying that if national guidelines are prepared be a quat the air plan would have to be reviewed your argument is but there 's obviously much my fault no no no no no no I just say that a lot of the information that the national standards are based on a based on out of date but their national standards so look let 's work out how we can resolve this so there is an ax there 's an amendment and your name that we remove that we add the words vehicle emissions to know we can do next been addressed by yeah so you 'll get quite comfortable with your knots proceeding with their yep and but item three we 've had counsel advice that you 're very comfortable with that so that inclusion yes so we can we can accept that as included in the submission and but it 's item five the additions there and and staff don 't recommend that we add those words is that right I know that that 's fine that 's item that 's the last part of item five the other counsel encouraging environment canterbury to look for opportunities that 's some pretty much a rewrite of of what just saw Myint on that though I think that where you said it was earlier relates to interest-free loans and subsidy and I think that that 's slightly problematic and this issue as far as just extending deadlines if at all possible I don 't know about other people have been struggling with insurance companies and so forth but if you 've got to suddenly got to fill in a million films and show your income and so forth I think you just walk away from it but I mean I 'm happy to combine the two of people don 't like the rewrite of that but I don 't do think that that 's much clearer and stronger and I think we need to be in the submission but I don 't think that we 're asking he can 't blow up your your Amendment asks he can to look for opportunities to extend deadlines related to emission limit which I don 't think we can do well I mean we can put it up as an amendment australia the national environmental standards asset-buying legislations there i well under we could just add a couple of to that so cancel encourages Environment Canterbury to look for opportunities to extend extend deadlines to the extent that it 's able to within the national environmental standard to the extent that it 's able to and that might relate to enforcement as well would not yeah fine that 's around looking to options to take a proactive take a be responsive to the circumstances of the community and the framework yes any assets for it yep that 's it some wording to that effect that we need to look at yeah right so do we want to write the wording here narrower people comfortable with getting the wording sorted out afterwards by agreement so maybe a lien full sign it off but if aliens filigree then now do it now Nene okay I mean well I like a light rock Mike was saying so the council encourages Environment Canterbury to be responsive to the circumstances of the community affected by the ongoing impacts of the twenty ten twenty Len 11 Canterbury earthquakes do you want all of the rest of their sentence the simple ancestors and the in the document so and you say that to the extent that it is and that enter the extent that it is able to to extend deadlines relating to emission limits is it yes yep and to the extent that it is able to to extend deadlines relating to emission limits of the to the extent that is able to under the NES yeah I be good to acknowledge that he can is actually being quite proactive in this area to eventually we have noted that in the subsidies that they 're off will we have noted that we would request that they provide subsidies but they are being proactive and particularly was that new ultra low emission boon of its thing brunel yeah I mean the point is is that the the ultra low bidder did not exist before the earthquakes and it was really only the creation of the amendment to the rule around the use of no low emission burners that actually meant they became commercially viable I think the price will go down but I think that it is important that get them and to their homes yeah so look I think it 's important that I think the staff refer to the fact that there 's four no fewer than five five occasions he can commissioner and staff have come to our come up to the atty committee and given given us presentations around this issue it is complex part of that was very early on we said look we would really like you to make sure that in fact any program that is available on the city that you work in conjunction with them and develop other partnerships they certainly have done there and there 's no question and that they they have worked with the agency 's well including for example with our staff so I think acknowledgement should be given to the constructive way that things have been done within this within these standards is pulling is indicated well I I think that you know para 3 while the council supports environments Canterbury 's encouragement and development etc etc as well aware of the significant costs I mean maybe it before the sentence you want a sentence approach that they 've taken under you know challenging circumstances gomen that 's that might satisfy people yep yeah so it 's basically in suit at the beginning of the scene of the paragraph the council congratulate sin vironment can 't grieve for its cooperative approach court reserved and proactive approach and proactive approach to addressing what are very challenging issues yeah in relation to personal you know individual homes and but the wider air quality issue because I think it is public health versus personal health and that doesn 't ways it isn 't always easy oh and in relation to heating individual homes and the wider public health issues around air quality because it that they are the two issues all right so are you happy to move it now regulatory programs that 's on page sorry I 'm working off my document but it 's under number 1 introduction still it 's got non-regulatory programs on the left-hand side page 78 at the bottom the Council believes that the goodwood merchants program contributes significantly to improve their quality now I clued the same from an anecdotal perspective a little weak to say beliefs we don 't have any technical evidence as such i 'm sure that that is available but i think we could reword that to say the council 's supports the good work rich and program as it contributes significantly thank you that 's much better than 3d polity Yeah right just make you change yeah i work in this lie 's be seen as an amendment yeah working with key partners on the next page could you just explain what that first sentence means the council supports the plan discussion of working with the territorial authorities I assume there 's a typo and then I 'll hand over to Janine for this no it 's not a typo but I think once we explain it we want to be able to reword it with the I think it needs rewording and basically the cap that the sentence accounts are supports the plants discussions of working with territory authorities and this is particularly in relation to how land use planning might be undertaken that might help us with issues through district plans and its foot as as the council might be able to to undertake to also help with their quality issues and so forth so the council supports discussions with territorial authorities around plans would that work it 's our ground meat land use planning maybe and non regulatory mechanisms right so if we could make that change please because I thought that was something not not to appear at all number five objectives something that I think is not very clear and the submission do we have to type all these down no no don 't know what job other than the ones that have been written already recorded we 've got those comments report okay so if you can can you just make a note of that last one that you see because I 've read yet thank you yep objectives and I don 't think we reiterate enough the issue around affordability because basically in 2016 we lower missing burners are we are now on page 9 of 18 hour 3 9 of mine all of part 5 of the plan my suggestion is that because the objectives as outlined in 've listed them 5.6 s developments and innovation and technology are unable to provide solutions to air quality issues you can see from my notes there i think affordability and choice is really important a staffer accepting of that I 've got a techniques to it on my copy so I don 't be good to me we can really make that change yep thank you very much I 'm pretty sure that is it yep yep good work yes I thought I thought this was gonna be highly complex and that we would end up having to a refer it back to the submissions pedal I 'm very delighted so now um so you want to move this Ellie yep and it would like to be seconded by Phil clear water so the debate now Yanni um I think this is a really important issue facing our city and you know I know firsthand as someone who suffered from asthma just how important is to clean up their quality and I can in my lifetime and last two decades can see a real improvement in terms of equality is in there not so much and you can just feel it in winter but I also know that Deb cold homes are also a huge contributor to health problems in our city and I do think we need to really think about the balance I think I encourage every counselor to read the parliamentary commissioner for the environments report it is outstanding that actually makes the number of very salient points and I think we should and I appreciate you don 't want us to today but I 'm happy to do a notice of motion or get a report on the next council agenda to actively progress the recommendations that she 's put forward to government because I think as a city we can play a leadership role in terms of equality and the health impact that it has currently the current framework is not working in my view as measuring something that doesn 't make any sense when you read this report and although we 've seen some improvement I think there 's a lot smarter and cleverer ways to actually address the concerns and i just finished standards for particular matter should be set to achieve the lowest concentrations possible in the context of local constraints capabilities and public health priorities and that 's really I think really really important and you know that the Commissioner goes on to say it would be counterproductive to have actions that reduce emissions from wood burners that result in more cold damp houses and unfortunately in our see we still have a number of people waiting for their earthquake repairs who are living and dead Cole leaky buildings who in some cases even when they get the repairs are still going to be living in depth in cold buildings because there 's been a real lack of progress addressing that issue so I think we need to be really proactive in the space I think there are other solutions and simply bearing modern efficient would be as currently on the market I think it 's a small step to address the air quality that has much further reaching consequences if you think of places like Walston in st. Albans awesome I know well there are many other chemicals and things have a lot greater monitoring and understanding rather than just bending the simple easy solution of banning the modern wood business which I don 't think that dress is the real health issue so I 'll support this but I do signal that we need to do more work around this area Ellie thank you clean air is more than just important but i think what constitutes clean air is also just as important important what I 've found frustrating about this process and I thank the staff for their patience with me because there are rules and regulations that have to be adhered to that I find quite illogical and frustrating however that doesn 't change the fact that we have to adhere to them currently the National Environment standards I believe should take cognizance of regional issues including the cold and Christchurch boosters for example the cold in Auckland and i think that the views for the parliament from the parliamentary commissioner for the environment dr. Jan right or indeed the Association for independent air with regards to World Health Organization guidelines should be listened to and addressed people for whom the heat pumps or do not work whether it is because of a cost elderly people on fixed incomes the fact that a play blow dust around and affect people with asthma and solid fuel burners are extremely short as far as choice goes with pallet burners requiring electricity and in fact the ultra-low emission burner that will heat the bigger area than the smaller one on the market requiring power after four days so there are no solid fuel burners on the market at the moment that will run without electricity government figures show that the average electricity unit price rose from 14.6 sensor unit in 2002 to 27.6 sensor unit and 2014 that 's a gain of almost ninety percent in almost three times faster than general inflation we need to address this and make people we know more than many others the importance of resilience and being able to operate your heating for example without a reliance on electricity I support the council 's submission that encourages clean air in our city but I am disappointed at what I see is overly onerous and really do support my colleagues and doing everything they can to raise the issue at a central government level so that our people have more choice and I 'm not affected by the costs that putting heat pumps in does cause for some people we 've stats related to hospital admissions and GP visits for wood burner related illnesses however I have tried for the last two weeks to get stats related to GP or hospital admissions related to bronchial illness as resulting from cold and damp homes and I cannot get them that information is not available thank you for your patience with me on this this is something I feel passionate about and I think we need to look at it further from a national environmental standards position great thank you so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and thank you to the submissions panel and thank you ali for you know putting on the hard yards and thank you to the staff because i know that you 've really helped make item on the agenda _"

    "text": "so I shall invite councillor Jones to lead off there is a copy of the track changes that I sent to everyone that were Mazel transient as I see my apologies for that so that 's coming to Shirley because she 's just printing that out upstairs so questions I just wanted to ask staff please to comment on recent comments comment on comments from the parliamentary commissioner for the environment dr. Jenn Wright who has coined it on the government 's policy on air pollution which obviously informs the national environmental standards saying that concentrating on reducing high pollution days was wrong she says that the and her analysis of the 2014 air domain report the World Health Organization guidelines should be adopted I 'd be keen on your comments on that place can I first take the opportunity to introduce to you Janine color and environmental planner who works here at the City Council and bring z who most pretty well acquainted with one of their legal advisors for this airplane submission in response to your question or your comment the it 's important to understand that the part of the measurement of all particulates from 10 being a course of fragment down cause the size down to the finer 2.5 and it is right that the the council or sorry II can doesn 't that they do monitor for that but they they 're monitoring is restricted to 22 stations or to monitoring areas in Christchurch and that there is always the opportunity to do more monitoring to have more detailed information and just recently he can have agreed to do more detailed monitoring and littleton as part of trying to better understand the PM to point five from from diesel emissions we as council staff where we 're not air quality scientists and we 're not only in a good position to be able to comment on on necessarily on the methodology or the approach that he can has used to be able to determine that the Mont the nature of the monitoring that they do but we are generally satisfied that the approach that they you that I 've used or that they use is robust enough to help determine the provisions or for the airplane the logic is lost on me there appreciate that you 're not scientists however how can you be confident of the robustness of the methodology and other information supplied by II can if you 're unable to analyze it for that robustness I don 't I can 't follow that I think the only coming I can make to that is that as part of the development of the the proposed plane II can has worked closely across across the region with a lot of the district all the districts and as well as that they have played they have carried out extensive consultation and engagement with this council through presentations to the the itne committee as well as to air air board members and board chairs so we have accepted well we 're not in a position other than to accept the methodology that they have used and we 're done that on the understanding that to achieve the the standards that have been set for Christchurch that this is a method that this approach will achieve those objectives in terms of the reduced number of high pollution are at the top of the submission and perhaps we could just talk to those so that would that be acceptable man right so if we could just start with I think they 're on the copy in front of you and everyone else should be getting it shortly oh no it 's in your agenda isn 't it yeah great my they 've been these are the general comments at the top okay thank you the first comment as I was alluding to work closely with he can over the last 12 to 18 months this is at both the staff level and and through the presentations by Commissioner Bedford and staff to to the council overall the plan we feel it 's a well well structured plan for a regional plan sometimes they 're difficult to understand but this is a particularly clearly written plan and on the basis of that we are confident that the the plan provisions will help to achieve those standards which have been set for e can to achieve we support the overall overall intent of the plan and just by boat by on the planned structure and what it was to achieve so he put in a submission on that well in fact it was a comment rather than a submission and also we commented on the pre notified draft of the submission which generally the council generally supported the position that he came was taking just to comment and in relation to councillor Jones track changes here under to their vehicle emissions the inclusion of that we we don 't agree with because he can is unable to deal with vehicle emissions through through the air plan and that is clearly explained and that introductory chapter of the airplane on point three there those additions we would be happy to include those so we think that is a useful change to the general comment number three over the page will over my page point number 5 i 'm just going to get your name to talk a little bit more about that this relates to the deadlines that the that he can have set for the use of for the installation of ultra low emission wood burners so I 'll just is national regulations set the time frame by which the different levels have to be met he can must meet them and they cannot be more they cannot set standards that are more lenient than those standards that are on the National Environment standards so in terms of when the deadline to meet it can actually doesn 't have any ability to change the end point all they have is the ability to change the way to determine the way that they meet those standards so the rules that they sit in the plan are their description of how they feel that they can meet the deadline that they 're required to meet so that sort of gives an idea that they can 't extend it however if that is not to say that the matter that they have meant try to manage to meet that standard is necessarily correct there may be other options that they could do to meet those standards within that set time frame I do get rid of totally get rid of wilderness I mean and not allow any that might I don 't know have to do all the scientific stuff and behind it to determine what that would actually mean would you achieve it based on that but the mechanism they change that and if the council felt that there were different ways they could do it they might be able to put a submission and that says we think you could do it this way and and saying that the looking at the section 32 report that looks at there 's particular rules and how they 've managed it they have looked at the option of doing nothing which obviously they will totally meet the network they will totally miss the national standards they have looked at what the standards are and the operative ear plan which basically means would be honest full stop so there will be no ultra low emission no lo mission by i think it was by 2020 but they actually still won 't meet the standards according to their section 32 they will still will not be able to meet the deadline set by the National Environment standards they the option that they 've put on the in the ultra-low emission burners and the timeframe for getting rid of the low emission burners their conclusion is that they will meet the standard set by the National Environment standard equality so there but so there has to an extent gone through that process and saying if we do this are we going to meet the standards and they think they will whether there 's another method of doing things up I don 't know and again you would need to have equality scientists that would quite a lot of research to go back and look at the various different options that you might be able to use to see whether that could be actually can I ask um around the options available when it sounds like there aren 't any with regards to extending deadlines or and I know you mentioned you cannot be more lenient and I 've heard that often and I understand that however there was some discretion applied from memory after the earthquakes wasn 't there with the deadlines altered slightly to enable people to use fires and wood burners because houses were still ik to thank you horse so they didn 't prosecute people for using their wood burner right so is that something that we could consider with regards to I I think it 's already in the submission commented on go sign yeah but that it 's a good idea for a came to in some circumstances use that enforcement discretion yep point I 'm when you 're talking about achieving the standards me talking about the achieva no more than three high pollution days per year it 's basically the state of the PM teen standards and there 's a with them they the the ne ne s standards themselves they sit they have a table that is based on it gives a time frame by which you have to achieve that standard depending on whether you have you 're in an environment that isn 't very polluted or whether you 're in an ear shed and it sets standards within that breaks it down when you have to meet particular standards and they have to be as least as stringent as those standards set how they do it is standards any ken wants to leave those by 2016 I 'm sorry he Candice wants to meet that by 2016 now those are the three that 's part of that the excuse me I 'll just have to find the I think there might be a comment that that that he can have got some choice in this matter but they don 't they 're and they 're covered by initial environmentally dias yeah it 's fine basically for example and we 're going to make the assumption that this the more than 10 or more exceedances per year which in christchurch probably is reasonable to assume by the first of September at 2011 to the 31st of August 2016 that is the period which exceedances our sentence is allowed the number of exceedances is unlimited by 2016 to 2020 they 're only allowed to have three or fewer periods it 's in a 12 hour and by 2020 they 're only allowed one or fewer and a 12-month period so they 've stake of it but we have to meet each of those deadlines Duke deputy mere ask what probably illegal version how 's that yeah yeah yeah I bet they might be commissioners appointed yes well the well there 's no there 's no penalty under the Resource Management Act that applies to a regional council that doesn 't comply with national standards there 's something a statutory requirement and councils yes they 're obliged to turn deliver on up yeah that 's right I mean look I understand what that what the issues are bad but I haven 't participated in any of us and I promise not to but you know having been the MP for an area that was pretty hard hurt during the earthquake we meet with the commissioners on several occasions over the issue of people having to rebuild and not being able to place with what with the wood burner that they had before and you know it is very hard but but but from another point of view the houses that have been rebuilt far more energy efficient than the ones that they 're replacing and and and you know but I understand why people felt that you need a degree electricity having been myself without electricity for more than two weeks hmm a dilemma and then I 'm a counselor Jones and I were outvoted on this on pretty okay with that that 's just how it goes but I guess one of the angles we were coming from is with with these issues and the unresolved insurance claims leading to the fact that people are living in homes with the cladding has compromised that one 's whistling through so we 're just pushing for a bit of you know just some flexibility some leniency maybe we need to but that that 's what we 've said in the so much yeah it 's like this I just wanted to make that explicit to not we 're about to can you direct us to that section paragraph three what page are the first pope the front page oh oh sorry support the leniency programme but I thought that stopped it I think that that I 've reduced the scope of it to some extent so I think there 's the opportunity there that they and I think I 've heard they have made genuine attempts or more than attempts they have genuinely help people in those situations where there are financial constraints but it 's not just financial as the point is is that if your house is still not being rebuilt or being repaired then you are not in a position to protect yourself against using the burner but what what what at what stage do you have to replace the current ones 2016 you can use the lower messing wood burners for up to 15 years or until 2019 I didn 't know that yani sorry oh sorry tim was first and then vianney and then David I 'll just I was told two days ago wake you sir think they 've got another 5,000 homes or they 've got 5,000 homes Tony books to either repair or rebuild of somewhere along those lines so that these will be affected by by this right now so ah yes they will be if they will be up yep come on things two days ago when i was talking to these guys they 've been in a house a week had a heat pump installed but the tenants wouldn 't use the heat pump because it couldn 't afford the power so here we are as a council looking at providing affordable housing for people who could not afford to run the heating and these and I take the mayor 's point that they hit new houses and new builds are a lot better and there will be far more efficient with regards to retaining heat but they also those windows and houses are sealed begir health problems from people using gas heaters with the humidity etc and those houses so did I just I think we we really do need to push the leniency side because one point three here on page 75 we 're also saying that we 're looking at fourteen to sixteen thousand dollars to install these new low emission Venice how many people can actually afford that and then we 're just pushing the ditch somewhere else because we 're going to assist these people with no or try to system with no interest or low interest loans but it is still a financial burden it 's amazing i have to say that these installations didn 't exist before the rule was created and sometimes the market will take a little bit longer to catch up but which is why i support the subsidy approach but a essent I mean none of this is easy because you know the truth is is that the air quality requirements are the air quality requirements and they have helped fix to so you know individual health effects that we can mitigate in other ways and population health effects that we can 't mitigate if we don 't address the Equality so that 's that 's the that 's the issue yani I mean a telling report and the parliamentary commission commissioner for the environment a telling point and who report is that you could comply with the PM 10 role while increasing particular pollution as you could have a year with two days at 51 as a file but didn 't have a year with no days over 50 and 20 days at 49 which would be considered a parts so it 's really obvious to me that we 're going to spend a lot of other than we make a lot of progress having a big debate as a council today about what goes in our mission I I personally think and would welcome the feedback from staff whether this is something we should put in this mission that we should be saying to EK we 're happy to work with them to approach government to change the NES and to get better reporting and monitoring and see some standards and plays that more adequately reflect what the wh 0 and the parliamentary could the Commissioner of the environment are saying because otherwise we 're going to go bed a whole bunch of fires wood burners and if you looked at st. Albans compared to Australia it would be rated as having good air quality and compared to the Australian scale it would be fine but we 're actually penalizing a community not to be able to use wood burners on on some logic that seems to be by all the best evidence I can see well of date and not effective and controlling the issue so I mean that 's not in the scope of their ear plan but it should be a point that they can Lobby or advocate to central government can can I suggest that if the council wishes to have their discussion were they can that it happened outside of the submission yeah because the session is about the appropriate of the proposed dear plan which they required to by law and the legal framework that I 've got ya and what you 're talking about is a discussion about what the appropriate legal framework should be because you 're talking about changes international environmental standard now the best vassar discussion that needs to be had with central government and what we don 't know either and an officer a council level at this stage is what would be the actual effect for our community in terms of cost of resources or cost of implementation if there was to be that 's change in the national environmental standard to a focus on p + 2.5 rather than pm10 so something something that that we we do know on the basis of the wood burners and homes putting out pm10 something like eighty percent of their pm10 as 2.5 that 's what i 've seen in the background documents so so you 've got a framework that 's limiting the PM 10 you are still limiting the 2.5 but not to the extent that the World Health Organization or the parliamentary commissioner for the environment recommend so so that 's it may in fact have to be further extension to the limits well but yes we don 't know I don 't know what those freak it further regulatory constraints would need to be or what they 're going to cost right in order to meet those recommendation okay can we take that issue offline then and and get some work done on there so that we can decide whether we raise that with a can but not as part of the submission process Adam the submission is that using the current standards doesn 't give you an accurate indication of the air quality impact on health but this is that this is the standard that they are applying that they legally have put on a submission that deals with the issues that we should be submitting on the separate issue is the question of the standard itself and that is something that I would like to see some advice on before I I mean I haven 't read the parliamentary commissioner for the environment and as I said I wasn 't going to participate in this debate so I 've been very naughty so far so how do you want to handle this out i do you want to deal with the oh sorry David and then Phil yeah I look on my comments were probably along the lines of what we 've been discussing and I think it 's a very good idea that we we look at the ongoing national environment standard because Christ Church has a temporary temperature inversion regime and and the the telling thing for me is that I don 't think under the current regime or any reproaching that we will ever get to one day by 2021 so we are basically setting ourselves up to fail because the the standard doesn 't reflect the the never achieve it so I support previous speakers and then the desire to look at that further but we are being asked to make a submission on the basis of an environmental standard that exists and we 're doing it but the reality for me is that we 're never going to to actually achieve the required stem esha under the current standard hell well I just want to ask a question and especially for those counselors who weren 't on the submissions panel and its other staff really in relation to that to the health studies that have been done it 's right at the front of the Canterbury of the ear regional plan just in terms of the numbers of the impacts on health if you might just run that past us for those who haven 't got a copy of their precooked here aunt is it and those example die prematurely cardiac hospital admission and respiratory admissions if you could just run that past us I think they 're pretty much this is under the introduction section Europe yes okay it 's estimated in Canberra each year 435 adults of the age 30 plus died prematurely 72 cardiac hospital admissions and 108 respiratory hospital admissions so as a state is here as clear that improving air quality could reduce the number of premature deaths caused by the exposures of poor quality year and Paul just a couple of things first is that we have actually improved air quality since we stopped cold burners and open fires and so the reduction of even further you know hi admitting burners is going to improve health nor do be quick absolutely second thing is that we there 's some of us debates around next the affordability and I would be nice to see actually some something in here that have you talked about how much across around a heat pump and how much it costs to buy would even if it is low burner or ultra low better chemist by wood pellets because I understand they have all got up and costs to a quite a considerable degree and some of the items around about why get free wood but not anybody gets free wood so we 've been good the various heating options because I run a I 've run all those various options and to me the heat part certainly is quite affordable with your Roman problem it will be in good as part of this to a better some information that could have supported some of this debate that we 're having here today except that 's not the Canterbury regional plan that 's the other issues that we should be advising people on you know in terms of the options so Glenn thank you think it 's that emotion period 30 before can you tell me whether that data indicates that the that is the sole cause of those a statistics that those deaths but it 's not entirely clear and then the drip and the introduction as to where that is the sole cause the sole cause to me it reads so that 's a significant contributing factor there are a number of studies that have been done in reports which I have been sent on to councillor Jones and councillor clearwater as well around some of the health effects and some of those that die quite well without those now see can out there is I 'm sorry that was a bit facetious my comment here is that it seems to be that the commissioners a court they have to uphold this standard but it 's a BAU standard for the rest of the country and this is not be a you for some parts of Christ use when of people affected by the Equality hasn 't changed at all what 's changed as the people having issues around heating their homes so there are two separate issues and one can be mitigated on a household basis and the other one can 't_''_1766.87 be mitigated except on a rose basis for the population donuts that that 's the issue it 's a trade-off between one or the other but the Environment Canterbury cannot change the national environmental standard that they 're applying but Ali do you I don 't agree with your that and I don 't agree with you on that because i think that the data on which we are basing some of these stats is flawed in the methodology and it six on the solution for example at present there are no national guidelines for PM 2.5 although it is increasingly recognized as significant health issue it appears in Christchurch particularly during the winter the main sources would combustion 92% and that is related to 2001 and 2002 figures now we may have some states related to hospital admissions and I concur with my colleague in Livingston with regard to actually substantiate in the breakdown of those admissions and what the causes of those illnesses and deaths but we do not have stats related to hospital admissions and GP visits for cold and damp and bronchial illnesses result resulting from from those cold and damp damp homes I do not understand how we can be using stats related to possible death and illness related to PM 10 when we don 't have stats to actually look at what 's causing illness and Missouri for people and death because of cold damp incessant referring to PM 10 _"

formal submissions although some submissions are still coming in and about 550 submitters wish to be heard energy see we 've received a number of petitions that had also increased the number of feedback that we 've got we had about 11 public meetings which most of you attended including a Pacific island phone 0 and 2 sector breakfast for business and in one for NGO community sector which was vocal really well attended there 's also been significant strong strong interest on their social media with over 13,000 views of their long-term plan on Facebook and around 1800 comments on our posts and much more on our timeline the other thing we 've had as a number of legume er requests for more detailed information that 's really stretched the resources in terms of providing feedback around loads the other thing that we 're looking at in collaboration with the mayor 's office is of the issues in a long-term plan which we actually just provide through the untouch into the consultation and the decisions to be made towards the end of June just looking at the other issues in my paper I just wanted to update you that as agreed we 've looked at the Indian closest around capital expenditure and the executive team signed off a program to streamline that process looking at the whole range of things from the beginning in terms of the business cases and the work around bench clarity around how we make change or Chris how the process is streamlined throughout the organization the decision gates in really to looking at improving clarity improving information streamlining processes and improving performance and accountability around our capital process so that we actually deliver on what we say we 're going to deliver on but also that we make sure that we have a rolling process that doesn 't mean that we have fewer delays from approvals actually getting on and delivering on our capex and finally I just draw your attention to some of the pilots of work to small pilots but important ones one is a pilot payment about dog registrations so rather than him to front up through a service center we 're going to pilot the opportunity to do that online so people have a choice around that but will be an indication are some of the things that we want to do in the future and the other one is around the citizen request for service mobile application called snap seemed and sold so if you see in a shoe your pot all you take a picture of it cinder done it gets a customer service registration and then we can fix it so again that will pilot that but there will be something that it makes it easier for people to raise our shoes and get them sold over time yay I like that one I don 't haven 't got a dog has anyone got a dog around the table are you all up for the pilot you 're enrolled for it you told your dogs looking forward to it right are there any questions I 'm Jimmy you male actor patience the report is the kind of the the chart in here I 'm particular concern the two issues one is a capital expenditure high risk of the angular delivery because in here where is the seven and he 6.2 million dollars below plan the other ones are scripted rebuilt is also another high-risk under delivery is 124 points several million below the plan I 'm wondering whether the staff have any medication strategy if yes as the status yes so that the review of our proceeds around capital expenditure will assist a bit into the future but they want that cut these two gress cover and the issues are a range of things so that it includes things that had been delayed for various reasons so things such as you know work on winery sewer project a hosel library service center so things that are in progress but had been delayed over time some of the work around scoot where there 's been an optimization process so that 's being pushed out some of the sea relief projects we were waiting you know to actually make the payment for some of for that that 's like the bus interchange they haven 't sent an invoice you nice so when they send an invoice will make the deployments but it shows here is not having this meet you know but I mean it 's not it 's not satisfactory but it 's there are a number of things than these numbers that actually don 't show up like that the delay and getting the land for building the library the delay that we 've had in the town hall so you 're all of these things add up as things that are that would have been on budget for it mature now but haven 't_''_355.82 been expended but do you want to highlight just a few of those that sort of big-ticket item yes well the things such as the cycleways the things that were pain and the libraries and see need a wants to make a statement right so that was in the budget but it but it was optimized out but it 's now beckons program yeah ok so we are the things that we can control we 're looking that are actually related to other agencies such as you know payment for the bus exchange or our contribution to that which we need to follow up on but which are things that are more difficult for us to to manage secure a second question Thank You mayor second question regarding to the health and safety issue on page 31 I 'm particular counselor to unit once a building concern the other ones OTS because we review in much you know the pay lost instance is a 16 year to date only 27 days double pass Allah my mind the other one obvious emerge is 63 a whole year up to year two days 239 in here even the management have in place in order medication the strategy for extended reduction but I 'm particular concern when the instrumentation strategy has been set up but why don this the ninth month you know whether have no any kind of the progress this is my particular cancer so it 's hard to say I 'm just from the table Weaver that 's one serious incident whether it 's a number of say why it happened in March I think it might be more useful if perhaps next time they give you some things or so that you get a bit of sense of what sort of things are happening but we have a very strong health and safety focus and it 's important that we do have mitigating factors where we can around to collect shoes I think getting you a bit more information let me help yep Jamie thank you and I 've seen this last time but I 'm still continually impressed with the informative nature of your siiii reports the dashboard approaches very refreshing and it 's fantastic um health and safety as well kind of some of the questions are Jimmy but same type of different vein I don 't know if I should HP preoccupy myself around the bus and I am that 's really what my question is I 'm I 'm Health and Safety overload man you know that we saw on big base together um my question is though like for instance if there 's a lot of things here which I would are more important than dots so instead of having you know the last 10 agendas around me I want to know if I 'm you know 13 medical injuries or something in March as is that 10 more than last time you so I can do a calculation work out the year-to-date average and everything but you want to see how it 's going and in hitting down as the direction of where we want to go out spit they probably will be a spite because you bought a really strong health and safety focus so that brings the awareness around it which generally increases reporting we 've got new legislation coming in September I 'm very aware of directors liabilities ever in responsibilities I 'm very unclear on what counselor liabilities or responsibilities are so I love going through the stuff from a governance perspective but what I hate doing is wasting my time and do I need to be doing this do we need to how much attention do we need to give it as it possible that you could peps do a bit of work or for on where directors responsibilities lie in light of the new legislation come in September around health and safety I want to take it seriously but I was the one moment BOTS I think that 's an excellent idea I don 't think we 're we 're counselors around as I say directors sorry counselors yeah I think it 's an excellent idea and I think that we 're working through those issues as well okay thank you we can fight a briefing on them great okay I yani ok I have several questions ones just chasing up around the minister of culture and heritage we asked to meet her and I think that was an item that was outstanding from a previous report have we had any progress around council meeting with her and talking through the irritant recovery program sorry I must been away when it was raised yeah thank you I 'm not having but we can follow up again okay it 's just because I mean obviously we 're seeing you know issues around heritage coming up time and time again public trust building for example so i think requested to meet with the minister three times and we haven 't had a single meeting since it is quite well no I did meet with here you can I don 't he said I know and nobody told me that it was to be a meeting with the entire council I meet with her own a couple of issues that some were related to the general heritage issues but there were other specific issues that I was meeting with her about she is the minister that is involved in the earthquake memorial alongside the Associate Minister for earthquake recovery so I had a reason to meet with her otherwise so I do apologize that I didn 't extend it to every single member of the Council but I will make sure that we extend another invitation to hear although we here we did invite her back yeah what I like you just the second question is the horizontal infrastructure review which we 're eagerly waiting supposed to be done by the first to December last year when we know where you 're going to get briefed on over two days comment on that I 'll give you exact date I 'm not sure she 's going his correspondence going back between serum here and ourselves to try and get some agreement around some of the wheeling and some of the issues one of the areas it is there 's a bit of historical spin that we need to resolve some issues that need to be resolved around there in the chief executives I 'm meeting over a couple of those sorts of issues because one of the points we want to do is get what is the cost of the whole program and so basically there 's got to be agreement around but I mean what the work needs to be done in the future but also the historical spin hopefully we are hoping that it 'll be within the needs done probably so can we organize our informal to get a briefing on the first draft and what the issues are I think there 's some those said there 's a whole lot of discussion to go to complete and agree on you know what was of the overall cost of the program because there that Ben determines what her advice will be the truth is is that there 's no point having a discussion on the on the draft when the draft may change so what 's going to be very relevant to council is what her report says and her final report has not yet Britain but Dave are you expecting it in a week okay here is correspondent this agreement is leaving tomorrow there will be some of that historical so that could come to an informal on either next monday if it we 've been or the following monday but probably the following monday so i just think if there 's discussion about key aspects of their draft that are relevant to us at a governance people and i take for example the changing of earthquake standards of repair standards through cabinet which was done without us being a we are at a governance level then I 've expect us to be able to provide some feedback on what the issues of contention the word that we 've been raised and where issues but it was around what was for instance what was previously paid for and we were that was weapon yeah the coffee or agreement or not so I 'm just related to that obviously some of us and I know gleam for example in terms of pages road bridge knows what 's happening there I 'm still waiting for the optimization program with we had probably six to eight months ago a workshop around and we were given Mets of the areas that were and and we 're out we were given a list of projects and told there was a process underway it work out what was going to be funded I think it was low medium or moderate or high there are three kind of options do can we get a list of the projects that are funded so that or not funded and the time frame so that we can work there throw in terms of the Volt implant because I 've got people in my community that want to make submissions about what 's being done or not being done but but I don 't get that information and run the optimization program is the pig look duelist approaching yesterday but because of some uncertainty around some of the funding they didn 't actually release any program if I gave you a list of the things that aren 't unfunded at the moment they may be funded as we move forward in there are discussions happening in Syria at the moment just to try and release the next structure work so basically they have been I 've mice into their the issue if you go and say well they 're not funded it tomorrow they may be funded and so that program we are slowly coming our way down certainly the horizontal infrastructure will I would have mentioned within a hopefully by one July we will have a very clear of what 's in the program and what 's out of the program we will have had the horizontal infrastructure that will be then the subject or horizontal assessment will be then a subject to that we are discussing with the minister we would then have a clarity around the total funding available and we maybe it will be a conversation then hopefully we 'll the problems they try that that counselor you 're handsome i can predict what he 's going to say on this occasion and that is that we have to make some decisions about our capital program probably mid may if we are to meet the deadline of our LTP process so I think that what he wants us to see fit into the process a clear expression of what we 're committed to do under the under the horizontal infrastructure spend so that we can can look at it I mean because we 're not really getting to assess whether it 's in or out at this point because it 's Anna cypriot it 's a parallel process but it doesn 't quite fit with our review of our capital program money that we 've got in covers our commitment that 's right point in time so I 'm just like I think the community actually need to know what 's in and out so when they come and talk to us that the point that Dave 's just made it will be in well we don 't more than a period of time at any moment there 's a process to agree on what scope projects are going to be done so there 's a whole charge the government will release unknown into this week these are the projects that we 're going ahead worth Yahoo let 's go and celebrate we don 't know what they are and we don 't add a governance level have any input into the prioritization of the skirt repair projects that we think are important into what scope and standard that they 're done someone else as I just said it 's a parallel process it doesn 't mean their shells good night as well be described as we 've had the girl troopers as this was always going to be the challenge of doing an LTP when we 've got some unknowns it 's not the LTP it is the LTP because they look at the optimization process for hug or skirt was in a completely different space than the LTP process we have allocated funding our share of the cost to the horizontal infrastructure program we 've already allocated that managed under and I 'm closer to that is the prioritization within that allocated amount I don 't understand what you 're talking about but what you 're asking for isn 't readily available but if you want to if you want to see this pictures that were given to you last year that are now out of date well then fine you can have those but you will be misleading your constituents if you tell them that that is what the final story is what i 'm asking for the updated information that 's being used to make decisions around the prioritization that 's really making that they 're still making decisions is what you 've just heard from day and why are we not having any governance impart into those decisions because it 's a technical process that they 're going through it is system that would have used as we enter the structure set in delivering services to the people essentially how they think are they in the CPD the bigger the mains for higher priority than through a list of priorities 15 roading for example the priorities around based on NZT is manual and now reader in all their out basically the position very simple rules at their hand fun or compound it 's actually a technical process basically we 've got priorities 15 basically and we are tied to work and put as much as that but basically obviously or project is got a public health contribution and environmental people actually it 's a higher priority than one that only has one low so but it is a very technical mechanical process really that 's done it 's hard way that was just every project understood well this is an unsatisfactory process so what I would like is for a report to come to the next council meeting where we can actually look in the public arena look at the the horizontal infrastructure issues by then we should have the report there should be a an easy process for us to actually let the public know that issues that we 've got but I think that we are in a parallel process and that is I 'm not going to take any more questions on that one now so if you 'd like to move on to your next subject the lender a nudge program and the whole kind of flooding task force I just think it 'd be really useful maybe again that this report you know it 's very high level but that we I just want to check if we could get maybe for the next chief executives report an update on that flooding task force and land drainage program so that we could be really quick given the we 're going into winter given that we 've got a number of concerned communities over the further issues and I mean I know just you know over the last bit of bad weather or wet weather that we 've had seen the same areas still ponding still flooding over a year on it would be really good to understand just you know the progress we 've made what we 're doing because still some of the same concerns have been raised for example and Heath Kurt the concern was expressed again we perhaps it might be a good idea to get a cheers report on to the council agenda that might be the way to resolve their but a meeting on Friday tomorrow so for the next meeting we can have a cheese report from yeah okay that would be great okay thank you and people are welcome to feed and anything to through me to that subcommittee so I 'm particularly interested in local issues and what each councillor picks up from the community that 's really important that we feed that through yeah and that are flooding the money task force the flooding task force was a time-limited it was just a one-off to get things moving and it had a significant effect and and in the particular area that was focused on at the time but there are other issues that need to be resolved so if you just work well to some emails from last year through again yes yes you can do that again but it 's getting there fortunate you don 't see if another that 's fine but you know that the counselors are taking working group up and running and I think if you get a cheers report on to the agenda here then that 's the that 's the basis for reporting to the whole council I think we need to take more ownership of issues as councillors rather than relying on the chief executives reports Yeah right okay so um I 'll move that we received the report of the chief executive and seconded by a full clear water and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it scary _"

    "text": "the okay the public forum side of things and I understand that we have a presentation of a petition be given that this is to do with the long-term plan process it wouldn 't be normal to allow this to happen but there 's an incredible amount of trouble gone through to bring the petition to council today so i would like to invite than Wiggins vesta Boswell Malcolm Farrell and neri Fife to come forward and and take the public participation stand and over to you ah I should make one point actually before before you begin and that is that we have been talking as a council about how we structure the process of hearing submissions on the long-term plan and it it 's probably not a normal process but we 've already scheduled saturday the 16th of May for the council to come to Brighton we haven 't got the exact venue so it 's either going to be at Roy Stokes or it 'll be up at north New Brighton that the memorial hall bear so we are going to be coming to you and give opportunity to have a say on their load on the long-term plan so over to you yes I 'm aware of that M thank you and I think that 's great progress the thing is that the issue of the South equation Holiday Park which was usually known as the South great motor camp it 's been in existence for 70 years and March of this year when the draft long-term plan popped up some somebody in the priests actually noticed that there was an item there that said that the stage of the camp was precarious and that it would probably closed during 2015 that person contacted the lessee 's of the camp and that went on to us of course and we promptly got together an organization of the business in porter 's yeah several things are at issue here the information that or total lack of information that we 'd into this figure are in the draft long to impanel 2.3 23 million dollars to remediate the land buildings and sub structure they had actually been no land report done so that could not really be a the camp have had a geotech report done the result of which is in this document the the council were to come and visit the camp on Tuesday but due to inclement weather that didn 't happen so the document that had been prepared by the lessee 's for the information of the counselors I actually delivered that by hand on Tuesday afternoon so hopefully some of you have read that and are aware of the detailed issues at stake so there is no cost for remediating the land one of the ablution blocks yes a severely damaged the other brush pollution rock is at thirty-four percent of the necessary thirty-seven percent of being able to be used which means that picking especially as a result of that the ablution block was closed where they 're from oh thank you and a and probably a great deal of money was was sent in putting temporary ablution blocks which have been there for the last 23 years now okay so there 's been six weeks on behalf of the group that got together and all the supporters of lobbying council most form we 've been to many meetings and we have done a great deal of sitting outside supermarkets been talking to people and getting 6680 people signing our petition to support us and keeping the camp open and some of the meetings we 've been to there has been a fear a feeling put through to us that it was up to us I either Lisi 's and sports of the camp to come up with viable and alternative solutions to the closing of the camp I feel quite strongly that is actually up to the council to come up with a valid reason for actually closing it the the ablution blocks and buildings were already on pre-earthquake plan for upgrading and or replacing so that 's not an extra cost there is insurance involved in this whole thing we hope that it won 't sort of just disappear into a large hole it 's not been settled yet the infrastructure the the search and water supply is shared by the adjacent celebration and tennis club for us for the camp to be late and lumbered with the total cost half there 's a green cuts effects if you look in the back of this document you will find that the estimated two point three to three and ruling can actually be cut down quite reasonably to about two hundred and fifty five thousand dollars okay um sorry what 's the thing yeah the people who have been using the camp for the last 70 years have in the past mainly being New Zealand people as we were gathering as our signatures on a petition many people particularly older people said always to go in camp me when I was a kid and dad would go to work from there that still happens that still happens through the summer time but also there are 10,000 visitor nights mainly of foreign tourists that come through that camp River year in earlier in the arm and the summer season that came here to close three times because the camp was full yeah and they manage to do this I keep it open and keep it viable on limited temporary ablution and laundry it 's a kitchen accommodation the Leslie 's of the a 40th birthday party so they cannot be here to represent themselves at the moments but as a resident of 10 years standing in the camp I can assure you that these people have done a magnificent job in maintaining the camp even though in the past priya is correct they have tried to do some things to enhance the camp and have dug deeply into their own pockets to do so since the earthquake they have had no formal least they have been running on a month to my faces and despite the fact they could have walked away from that it amongst noticed they have kept it going but kept it going incredibly well there are 20 long-term family families living there long-term at the moment there are eight families living there while their houses are being repaired or renovated you there are people moved in a couple of weeks ago they live in rocking horse road there need temporary accommodation for a year they cashed in their accommodation allowance bought themselves a fabulous be caravan and they 're there for 12 months and they 're loving it and still is such an amazing asset to the community into the city find another seaside motor camp first one the only one near christchurch people talk about Spencer park yeah going there every time it rains the assuage comes back up the place so after it anyway following on about the lessee 's of the cab I think it 's very important a couple of blocks on it we backtrack sorry as a result of all the work that the supporters group have done over the last six or eight weeks the council and have been in dialogue with the lessee 's of the camp and as a result of this both Alessi 's and the appropriate parts of the council are going to go away come back together and work out ways of dealing with the whole issue as a result of this there 's some concern that if the as fixed to whatever level and there has been no formal lease for the last four years that the council was in feel obliged to to tender the lease there can be exceptional exceptional circumstances which I absolutely this and the current lease ISA standing this is at the time of the lac ever finishing of the lease should be allowed to take over and I think that that would be a very very important thing to do I think it would be cruel and unfair and pretty stupid to not let the current people who have held on through the last four years continue to do so right here we have six thousand six hundred in eighty a text ability to do it lots anyway thank you very much for your time thank you for the opportunity to speak to you I know it 's about fried ephemeral procedures and if anybody would like to Atlantic us any Christian well we won 't_''_592.66 we won 't_''_593.02 we like we shot this time but as I say will be coming out to Brighton on the 16 and we 'll have a good conversation then I 'm a lot more familiar with us than perhaps others realized as the former member of parliament for the erica i know that issues very well and I know that issues around requirements but we can we can we can deal with those two but but when we come out we 'll have a much better basis for a for a dialogue rather than to see it just as a pure you tell us what you think yeah and we 'll just soak it in and then make a decision I think we should have a good dive on the way opens only place that if it 's have brought up together played a wii with the console that 's great excellent well thank you very much for your time thank you and could I now invite John stringer to come forward good morning councillors no I 'm in here my name is John stringer I own and operate safeguard security at restart mall and we run the crush City Ambassador Program which greets the cruise boat tourists and visitors to the city on the buses and any visitors to Christ Church in the CBD and you do a fabulous job also you 've even greeted me on occasion well that 's the whole point of it really is to be a smiley to our city a pleasant experience despite everything we 've been through I want to talk about this morning about the homeless issue which Shelley Robinson alluded to in the paper during the week she identified perhaps 23 people who are our homeless community in the city I would suggest it 's a little bit larger than that depending on how you define homeless um we look after restart for the private landowners the restart the heart trust we look after their buildings and the land but more importantly we manage the public relationship with the homeless people the anti-social elements that creep back into the cvd and any issues that arise out of that public interface with anybody coming into the area so we are there all day and all night through till six a.m. the following morning so we have a very good handle on the issues that confront the CBD over the last several years my stuff and I have built very substantial relationships with the homeless and Shelley are Robinson alluded to the issues in the paper and I acknowledge our deputy Emir Vicki bucks comments the anti social aspects of this whole relationship are quite substantial I won 't go through a long litany of issues that we deal with with the homeless people and we do have some sympathy for them but on other occasions no sympathy at all many of the homeless in the CBD area are there by choice a lot of these kids come from good homes but they 've been kicked out of the homes by their grandparents or their parents or their friends all they 've been kicked out of homeless shelters and facilities because of drug alcohol and synthetic cannabis abuse issues mental health issues dishonesty crimes various attitudinal problems what I want to suggest this morning as I 'd be really interested in working with any counselors interested in perhaps exploring the possibility of not just addressing this issue from a shelter perspective it really is not just about shelter it 's about intervening in these kids lives and we 've honed and housed some of these kids got them into work but managing them on a case-by-case basis to address the issues that are preventing them that we could work together to produce some sort of temporary facility which is an intervention sort of facility which might be something like decommissioned buses set in a quadrangle or a marquee or an abandoned warehouse where we could fit some bunks but we had something like a camp mom or account dad who manage this 2325 number of people and look at the issues that are relevant to them on a case-by-case basis what are the issues that relate to you personally that 's prevent you from washing dishes at McDonald 's or in exchange for eight hours shelter a night and a hot meal which would get you through the day could you come and help us remove some of the sediment from some of the river banks or areas in our city perhaps we could teach you to build rock walls even go into private areas and clean up some of these empty sites weeding work at the sticks no wetlands there are so much that these homeless people could do which would give them a self sense of self esteem in exchange for some support we can provide them with food and shelter but into in the problems that are putting these kids on the streets for some of them longer than 10 years there is a systemic problem in these kids lives I invite them and encourage them and to work all the time I spoke to a girl this week who 's working Manchester Street and I said look what 's to stop you you 're a foot healthy young woman what 's to stop you cleaning dishes at McDonald 's she said well I don 't want to do that and that is often the problem we hurt and confront these kids simply do not want to work or an interested in working or are unable to work because they have difficulty socializing with people or listening to a boss or receiving guidance or advice so I think it 's more than a shelter issue for the small group of people in our city I think we can solve this problem but we do need to intervene and I 'd like to explore options with any counselors who would be interested in Men and Thank You counselors for your time and letting me speak to you today thank you and thank you for your insight to I think that I mean I 'm immediately thinking of who I want to put you in touch with because there 's another organization that 's dealing with kids that are on the margins and you are absolutely right treating the symptom doesn 't solve the problem yeah it 's the kind of ambulance at the top of the cliff rather than I 'm in defense at the top of the cliff rad may ambulance at the bowlin so thank you so much very welcoming to be right over the do you think yeah well these sessions are now made a thoroughly worthwhile after hearing something like me incredibly uplifting right I don 't know does it do you do want us to refer that a shoe to your committee yeah yeah because I 've got some ideas about who would be a really good connection for those people so you 'll get John 's details off hunger to contain you could invite him there yep by appointment but we don 't have any of those _"

  {
    "text": "okay okay I like me to start yep okay so the the first package does the document title chapter nine natural and cultural heritage version with changes shown 24th of April 2015 so on that one the resolution is to amend chapter nine as shown in the document tabled entitled as I 've just described and the key thing as three key things I 'd like to highlight to the in terms of some changes that are recommended now the first is on page 18 to 23 and that relates to the natural character section so what has been included in there within several of the policies as some values describing natural character values for night are who that is some additional points into the policies and then the second point is on in the Heritage section 69.3 at page 45 if you 'd like to turn into that and so that as a resolution relating to heritage upgrade works to heritage item and it relates to seismic fire and access code upgrades and the resolution or part of the change there is to have group one heritage buildings as the moment is proposed as restricted discretionary so that would mean for both group 1 and group 2 heritage items it would be a controlled activity status and it seemed to be more appropriate and quite adequate to manage the impact of that type of looks and just to rule of other points there some on page 46 in relation to settings there 's a proposal currently in the document that new development and the setting of a heritage item would be non notified now on further further analysis and proposing that HD we remove the non notification cause that it so there is an ability on a case-by-case basis to determine whether nonotification should be allowed and the final one as a minor of clarification to some claws referencing to do with the restrictive discretionary activities that 's a very minor point and then some other minor updates and that document around Clause number and titles so that 's the that 's the first resolution don 't know if you have any questions on those equations okay change to controlled activity what does that actually mean and can you only have two categories now we 're only going to have two categories okay so here to a category sorry a group one here at Josh and said item that 's a high significance here to Jason and a group to item as a significant heritage item they 're all significant was just the group 1 over upper significance so the rules are the same terms of the activity status across the board but we 're the difference and their activities recognition comes and of high and significant comes in at the menace of discretion so it would take it would have a role in the consent process and the what the controlled activity status would mean is there an applicant could apply for instance to do seismic upgrades now the council would not be able to tune the application down but they would be able to inform the development that we are and the development proposal and they would be able to put apply conditions around it and so we have looked very carefully at with it you could do commercial standards that 's not really achieved restrictive discretionary the type of works and that control would be quite applicable that does defer that so I 'm highlight to the the existing centricity recovery plan for currently for group 1 and group 2 heritage items it 's restricted sorry I need to check the provisions here but that proposal was to keep controlled across the board in verse 10 currently it 's currently for group 1 and group 2 it 's currently controls and group 3 and group for it 's currently permitted so are there a number of buildings alien that we 're in group 3 and four that are obviously now a group one or two where we 've made it harder for them to seismically upgrade so my perhaps if Amanda could speak to the mix of what 's going to group 1 and group 2 yes sir some buildings have gone up a group or some of them us one up two groups so aite group four buildings in the central city at least have gone to high significance so it 's a whip we 're aware as date list sorry can you prefer to and mushy jewels that 's still dropping the sizzle okay so can you just point to the ones that have gone up from one category to another detail the information I 'm sorry I 've just I 've just done the numbers we can come back to you with that perhaps or send it out to you on an email if you like because what what I mean that doesn 't have as the old schedules with here at the moment to do the comparison cameras here is like many how many how many buildings are we talking about and no you can 't have you got a difference between the CBD and the rest of the city yeah aite group boards have gone to up high significance than the central city group one yes oh yes aite group fours have gone to group one in the central city and cv to eat yep 23 group 3s have gone to group 1 33 grew on hang out to Greg one and CBD yes yeah 33 of the existing group to have gone to the new group 16 64 people do send out that directly affected party leaders but this notification doesn 't occur until June yes I know but but yet they haven 't been consulted what they don 't know because we have am determined not to do consultation no come along okay sorry I 'm just kind of you 're not going to have a it is important that we know but yeah we make that decision but yeah and so what 's the M and what 's the other group you 're sorry you went eight fours to 123 3 s 2 133 tues 21 yes so all of the group 1 buildings in the central city which the current group ones have gone to the new group right of stage so how many group ones are there 40 40 and now how to group to get made up off then has will group presumably some of the fours have gone to 2 and some of the threes have gone to 2 so could we have those numbers as well just to get billed motion I would note that this is also online available to the public I know but there 's a there 's a difference between consultation generally which is what when we 're not we 're not we 're not having hearings ourselves because the decision-makers the independent hearings panel but what I 'm worried about is is that there are a number of people out there who won 't know that this proposed listing is an offer until they get a letter and Joan that 's too late yeah Tim that have gone up to group 1 it seems quite a jump so they 've gone to group 1 because they are left was a big in it their significance is risen because they have survived or is it because of something else it 's because we 've revised our criteria and methodology for listing and we 've introduced thresholds or listing so what what is a group one at the moment is a place of national or international significance which has been assessed through a methodology and miracle assessment so we 've moved away from the numerical assessment because it 's not this practice and it actually came up with some strange than their real here at each value and though there any group falls at a stage brute force that 's so sorry absolutely certain of expectation that we have a more simplified district plan so staff is simplified it into two categories yep there was at least that we were looking at before the earthquake as we were doing the review so though that 's much clearer so there any group for sort of squad group to you rather than a group one yes but just I 've just sensible and all we see a number that have dropped off and being removed as well are there any well we can get those numbers as well yes so how many group threes and fours have gone all together off the list but you 're going to give us the the what the fours and three that have gone to group to now yes i can use do that in an email later today for you or tomorrow I 've got the Vic the figures of so out of the scene the 32 central city group fours 24 have moved to and the central city 26 have moved to the new group tone to take a photograph of it before we demolish it or what was the wrongs it was paddling Russian Duma lashad have to check the detail I 'll sorry for demolition it was a non-compliant for group 1 and group 2 and discretionary for groups ring and now it 's supposed to be non-compliant for all good items yeah I think the important thing to reflect on is that these items have been updated on a new revised robust methodologies of very thorough assessment so it 's from 1995 an update up to the present so they all meet the three show for significance the differences that we 've reflected a group 1 and group 2 approach exhibit you don 't know what the internal damage is on some of the buildings so as amanda 's outlined and who technical report which is outlined what the assessment process is being relative to what 's been examined as part of that assessment after the extent that that includes exterior or interior perp so have you seen inside all of not every single one of them it depends on the landowners willingness to allow us to look inside as well well it might be a hint did you still want a list of the heritage buildings outside of the city center and the groupings yeah I 'm sorry I 've kind of I haven 't_''_753.23 brought the appendix with me that 's I mean it street addresses don 't tell me what buildings were talking about so quite should end the paper that we got yeah it is and the second 32 by simply I 'll just bring your attention to the fact that those Central City figures a higher percentage of group three and four have moved to the new top group in the central city just because of the nature of heritage and the central city those are places which make a big contribution to City identity an example I can draw and as the bridges so a lot of the bridges were in groups three and four but those have gone to the higher group the new group one one quick one the very rich and it it have you got a you got a list of the central city buildings that we 're actually talking about I mean that 's just that 's what this she can schedule we 're just can you just draw my attention to the CBD page you know like the list of building it so I 'm Emily entered around a schedule of all the proposed items for chapter 9 yeah so that actually so that is chapter 9 it 's outside the central city and you may have in your package of information from last week the central city specific schedules what you would have them sorry yeah can we have a clue but they 're on the resident I 'll sorry they 're on the central city chapter which is because the central city chapter as a standalone chapter but they 'll be sure Jules attached to that to the actual chapter so other indices no they 're in the chapter project okay so these are all outside the CBD so how many of these have shifted category yeah so you 're talking now about outside central city at so I 've split Christchurch and banks peninsula those it split the mushy jewel of the 71 group for in christchurch 12 have gone to high significance 59 have gone to significant that said the new group to emily 9 59 59 yeah of the 84 current group three buildings in christchurch 25 have gone to high significance keep one yeah 59 have gone to significant group to so actually of the group 3s that all now in group 1 and 2 yes and same with the group pause yes right to have just been reallocated to group 12 yes except the rules not see yet as long as they not taken off the list nobody got taken off the list so 44 there have been 14 deletions from the christchurch list 49 from the banks peninsula list and four from the central city list those are our deletions a total of 67 are they deletions or demolitions deletion I mean the building still exists but they 've been diluted right and before we do those who can city once I 'd really like to know the names of those of the building must be on the other I don 't know what we love these central city proposed new historical things and then it 's just got a list by coca-cola both they show so happy to see you just say the natural color there then the section 32 but it 's also attached to the chapter I think one of the important things to note about the grouping in terms of how that comes in two flavors and rules is that the rules are the same engines as a trigger for a consent requirement regardless of whether it 's a group one or a group to building so as I said before it 's at the meadows of discretion where the built at consideration would be taken into account as to whether it 's appropriate to and in terms the rules some of the activity is actually more enabling around repairs and maintenance for instance it 's now permitted supposed to be commercial the standards and then the controlled activity status for heritage upgrade works for checking items as an enabling approach and the policy framework as a conservation principle so I think it is worth thinking about the grouping but in the context of her the planning provisions have been tailored around that but the rules have significantly changed for people who were previously three and four they would have changed to an extent yes like quotes for group 1 and group 2 they would have also changed and that 's cuz that 's been considered on and on a range of matters is to take into account the earthquake context the statement of expectations but also getting the right balances to win that is appropriate to have a high level of consenting requirement relative to with its potential before irreversible impact on the heritage building or where for instance like the controlled activity status we 're proposing that those work should go ahead and not be able to be declined but it 's good for the council to be able to inform that process I think that you know in terms of looking at this thank you that the struggle that we 're all having is that we can 't see what they were before so significance of the rule change so that that 's the best book that 's the struggle that we 're having as as counselors in its its its I was going to say it 's easy for you guys because you 're all over this and you you 've got the detail on your head and you 've got files which have shown in previous listings and current listings so but we don 't have that what we have in front of us is whether it 's got a Heritage listing and what group at so now but it doesn 't show where it 's come from and so we 're having a little bit of difficulty of knowing how many people going to be impacted by these changes we 're a little bit concerned about the the very late notification to people and it may well be that you know if we 're only talking you know literally you know if you know well less than less than 500 buildings and total across the two areas there may be a prior notification to them that they are being considered for people to the situation now rather than wait till June when we formally notify so we could do that but the chapters are going to the ministers next yeah so if you want to do that now or after they 've gone to the ministers and well before thats that 's fine we could do either way would you like us to tabulate in some way a comparison between the operative plan and the the proposed but could you here could you easily put together and just do it city why the city central city yep and then the in the rest and the rest and just basically but group them so so you 've done it by street address on that out of crisis but just group them as churches as private residences as you know school settings you know versus in an idea as what you know and a number of them will be things that we own as a council I presume that we own the new brighton you know clock I don 't know for sure but I presume we do so that we 've got 't know that it measures so much if we 're putting a higher rating on ourselves I just think that it 's because I would kind of know that we 're doing it and I think what we 'll do for you as well too to clarify the situation and also just to condense it for you is give you an understanding of the past rules and the proposed rules and what their effect is I don 't think potentially there is great as what no can see and that may be the case and and so a very simple summary of Walter the rules were for category 1 2 3 4 10 and what the rules are now for one and two and whether the whether the heritage New Zealand listing makes a difference you know because I 'm assuming that it does and it yet and then because I mean if the Heritage listing is sufficient in its own right to carry with it and I 've always wondered you know why for example you know we have things listed when they don 't and vice versa or two heritage but high significance for us seems to me that getting a a single streamlined approach to the heritage between here to New Zealand and ourselves which is what we 're trying to do but yes we 'll we 'll bring the up to you and what we 'll do is we 'll email that to you well before friday yeah so can i take your lead as to whether you 'd like to press on with the rest of the natural and cultural heritage chapter so that 's the ecological trees yeah it 's sure the iron is I mean you mentioned regards to we own some of them we 've got a team working but spirits since rising home butchers and they 've prob will have a repair strategy seat so if the team doesn 't know if there 's any I don 't know there may not be any change so there 's actually quite important that our own staff know that these changes and if indeed they 're going to affect that at all was well mean our community has been made for a long to happen etc so it 's really we need that cross and solid communication if you want yep yani but the thing that I want to read is the individual assessment from each building but i can 't find that in the documents that i 've got i looked through the East 32 if I wanted to look up you know the Antigua strict footbridge and the assessment you 've done where do I find that information so that was in the information that at last Friday was all on the sides two sides as a whole stack of information of an individual statement pure item so we do have business is it available electronically online how does yes so I just think we 've really useful to see neural network so that we can find it I 've tried like the discipline stuff and it 's really difficult it 's all online with the agenda just if you look under agendas you 'll see all the documents I 'm pretty I can 't find it and I keep going to be only just seen the link so a direct think it very useful and then the other thing is in the chapter that with God you 've got like a really good table of the new categories but I don 't know information we 're getting back is it possible to have maybe just to read box or something that shows we they 've come from because that 's kind of information that 's messing around the listings Eddie Maine oh if it was a grateful previously yeah that 's it but that was my point yeah yes say because eventually got the whole table here yes there 's nothing there I no no that 's what I just see was that the same from yeah thnkx we can tell what it was and I was just saying that that you know that there 's more perfect information than the department then there is around this table and I think that 's why people were struggling you know any book it 's nobody 's fault but we 're working on a really really tight timetable when you know I know that there 's probably a degree of frustration being expressed oh no that is fine we just wouldn 't put it in the section 32 because the section 32 is to support this current document yeah but what we 'll do is do that work for you and and circulate it to your well before friday and a section 32 as you 've lost an assessment on on my each tree so that you haven 't listed the assessment on the on the building so that 's what i find really difficult the assessments for the buildings of the year they are in the Dodger cement so weird printed out Yanni that they made that point on Friday in the members yeah but from a public one of you if you 're rolling that the draft proposal yeah they 're not gonna be reading that they 'll be online it 's the truth of it they 'll be on Modern Painters to very document right so the other two are saying things to me around this chapter other high street having there is a discussion around Heritage Areas and there 's I 'd really like to understand if we on the we 're on the chapter 9 which is not high street so high streets included on the central Central City chapter I 'm sorry I thought we talked so we just have been non central city here yeah natural and cultural heritage chapter nine so that 's all of these all of these places are marked as having been outside the central city but we 've already agreed to do this on friday so the question that we were asked is can we move on to the schedule of significant trees _"

    "text": "if we just take your time now to move through a few of the questions that were asked that we said we would get a response to so no more resolutions for this morning just going on to these questions because i think it 's about ten to nine well the only thing that I 'm worried about is is that some of the people that may have asked some of the questions make it have gone we may have lost them already do want to just run through that okay the questions are for example fire stations and corrections facilities include is permitted activities and residential stage two why is that the other one was the sale of scale of schools and the central city and in relation to what happened at Cathedral grammar third one was about contaminated land who deals with that and what 's the process assessment of the art gallery I can answer that now we will undertake an assessment and by the time this comes back to you from the ministers and also certainly by the time you might want to put a submission and then whether or not what it shows up we will bring to you and you can decide whether or not you can put it forward okay you can answer the Chester that the grammar Cathedral gamma because Yanni raised their questions so he 's here and hmm the scale of the school so Glinda can speak to that one yep i also got scott blair here because he 's the residential and it 's good he 's a bit of a over leg and the question of things you mentioned about cathedral grammar the zoning hasn 't actually extended that you obviously am identified that these many results and sent and to exceed that skull on tour to saw its luxury residential in that was processed originally the report was written as a discretionary activity just get the time i was about to be signed dog this new document from Sarah came out and then it was reassessed as a non-complying activity because of a new rule in here which made non-residential activities non-complying of our more than 300 square meters and so it was reassessed as an occupy of all the adjoining neighbors written consent would be joining neighbors so it wasn 't notified and Scott can speak to your position now was regard to the reading that 's coming out of the independent hearings panel on resentful in the central city and non-residential activities great was done for that no because the M it was not considered to be easy theory because it was just a sort of a displacement of classroom from the existing site and so no increase in terrific and do you know how many people could have lived on that site if it was fully well it was two houses submitted baseline so if you looked at height did today I can check it out at least be living for scene so it 's like one of a million sensitive sites i think so you could have had quite a few people but i don 't know if we in there and they just too large houses but now I think we 're now back to position and the Temple City chapter blir Nandi non-residential activities are discretionary or at least educational activities out and we need to need to have back to the recent the recent chapter 14 hearing sedative that have just concluded effectively we are the crown the council and although we haven 't seen the decision from the hearings panel yet has got to in terms of existing non-residential activities as it an amended policy in relation to to continuing and supporting the redevelopment and expansion it 's likely i don 't know the mind of the hearings panel but i think that they will probably i think that they will probably confirm them that policy that policy is also being drafted where a form of that policy has also been drafted into the central city residential zones as well what we 're trying to do is align what 's coming out of the hearings panel worth what 's with all the central city residential zone with what 's coming what we know is likely to come out of the as likely to come out of the decisions on chapter 14 this hopefully will head off if you like unnecessary submissions from the crown repeat where they might repeat as well as Glenda has pointed out and the central sit in the and the Crown 's version of the central city living zones non-compliance with the with certain noncom non-residential activity standards defaulted to non-complying activity that ironically doesn 't make the statement of expectations as well and in terms of being as simple and and reducing as much as possible the consent hurdles so what I believe what will come out of the stage 1 hearings for every chapter 14 will be that they will default to either restricted discretionary where the the effects can be clearly defined and the consent application can be focused or they 'll default to just go straight discretionary activity right yeah extraordinary because we actually do a consultation pre consultation around that living zone Central City chapter and one of the feedback that we got from the local residents growth and the people that submitted was overwhelmingly to strengthen the residential non coherence rules to make it harder for non-residential activities to go into residential neighborhoods and actually the government I mean it was the one thing in that announcement they chucked chucked out a number of things the one thing that people actually liked that they did was that the non-residential making it harder for non-residential to go into residential zones so I don 't know why we would support the amended policy to distinguish between the policy about existing non-residential activities in June really restricting establishment of new non-residential activities only maintaining a predominately residential alarms should have been so so regardless but so both of those are issues for inner-city reasons so we want to hold people up in the central city so allowing valuable use of that land that 's high density and has a pseudonym of amenity for people that want to live here to be able to be used by a one-story school that 's not a good reason its role is really bizarre I can 't_''_497.07 strategically justify that and I don 't think we you know we see the encroachment of the Salvation Army for example if we brought up all the low cost affordable bed sets in accommodation the net salisbury street case all that for a new church and they had a why we would allow that to continue so you know I personally think we need to stay strong to what the people have told us and you know I just I just don 't agree with this approach and I 'm concerned that we 're providing evidence 20 mins positive policies that that enables us and ironically the government it made one decision and now they 've got their go giving contract contradictory I 'm submission through the statement of expectation to what they 've already agreed okay as a little bit of background and packing back to the very first decisions the strategic directions decision the hearings panel introduced a new objective objective three point three point 11 that talks about community facilities it says fective Lee the the expedited recovery and establishment of community facilities and education activities to meet the needs of the community so it 's not increasing its role it 's not providing and are we covering base although the school 's fly buckets at three buildings well providing classrooms which we dashed but if you if you compare that to the loss of residential single-level classroom our way a hundred people living on that land I don 't think there would have been a hundred people living give the color stone houses the Park Terrace towers that were adjacent nearby would have had about a hundred people loom in them so it just seems this whole idea that recovery you know just I think we 've just got to competing a deepest we want people living in the central city that has to be a key focus and we need to have land available for people to do that whether it 's the affordable housing on Solsbury streets on lock down or whether it 's apartments that would go in hell for areas so and so how did had a deck work that because I know probably less interested in two houses being knocked down to expand a school too because I mean they didn 't have to sell it to anyone and they may not have necessarily got what they wanted from a developer who may or may not have built apartments there but what I am more concerned about the location of Manchester Street site because as yannick quite rightly points out it 's an ideal development site for residential and when you 've got a name bush and I 'm building you know sort of well having more than 20,000 people extra living and the CBD we 're on either they 're going to build graceful outside but I agree with you about the criminal court side no no no the Manchester yeah they 're going to crema course what does residential but the salvation I am the courts got got knocked out no no I 'm talking through the down as they talking I thought it was salisbury manchester as it not it 's colombo as it colombo yeah the graceful babe yeah and when mt scott isn 't sure where the new salvation army building is going and Manchester Street that is no no I 'm told that I 've got the wrong Street that 's colombo salisbury it 's a big corner section okay which goes right back into the heart of a ideal residential location okay and that 's a good question to ask the central city Scott is relaying to you is how the residential areas outside of the city center are being dealt with at the moment that 's what that he 's talking about the hearings on the residential stage one that 's all he can comment on any moment but but that impacts on the decision that was made and the CBD the well the strategic direction objective could well yes well it does these are overarching objectives that were signed off in the strategic directions but the Central City chapter hasn 't been notified yet it 's going out in June so you know there is only the government 's already changed our plan that 's right but we still have to have a residential we have to include all of the central city in the district plan under a district plan and that is why it 's a standalone chapter because of that interaction with the land use recovery plan and the central city recovery plan important say you 've already got the Central City chapter why are we doing it again because legally we are required to have a full the middle of the city what happens when this the Zurich disappears so we do we have been working with them closely and we are trying to align the rules that are been dealt with through the central city recovery plan and with our own rules well in some places they are different that has been explained to you in some degree yes so I don 't support the approach that we 're taking I am concerned about the ongoing encroachment into residential we have a housing crisis in the city we 're rezoning land on the fringes and the green fields because of it we told the lack of land supply and we 're enabling non-residential activities to an art and expand and residential wegmans I sorry I didn 't get that message I got the message that there are there are different rule that will apply on different parts of the city I mean I know that my understanding is there evidence in for the stage one for the residues no chapter it 's outside the CBD outside the CBD but the decision right Leon there is to just think of it between some of these non research activities which are the community facility including stalls in the other sorts of non-residential activities we are we looking to restrict them and the central study particularly those of commercial or industrial lecture and those zones so all that 's been facilitated as accessing community facility type and uses in existing residential University going I think that the idea of community facilities is for the local community to use them but I don 't know how many of the children that go to a cathedral gremo age you live in the CBD know that we can actually distinguish between stores on that bracelet no I know but a bit but it is the distinction between when you 're talking about our community facility and I know I mean you 're reading somebody else 's rules that they 've written so that 's not your fault there is more opportunity to speak to this more generally this friday when we go through the central city chapter I mean the only reason that Scott was here is to give you a bit going on residential outside of the city now we do appreciate it all right so we might in the meeting here because it 's five past nine okay and we 'll come back on friday friday at eight thirty yeah could you could you could you what I didn 't hit this morning was an indication of what chapters we were going through so i just had the notification without the i can get you think so can you just do the order that we 're going to deal with things on writing yes well it 's only a diary for eight o 'clock so far yeah but if you want a duty oh and we can make get through it but I look now it looks like love is forever if you 're free date yep cuz we 're good yeah I 've got an a moussaka wow that 's great it 's eight to 11 yep and then live in 212 us free and then yes yes that 's today yeah okay yeah and then we come back for an hour from 12 to 1 yeah and and have to schedule another meeting as soon as possible after that because we need to get this off to the minister 's oh cool thank you all right thank you _"

    "text": "good morning counselors will continue on stage three this morning and to end also on to Friday and as counselor buck has said we start with the bandits crossing building and then we 'll move on into continuing to the end of all of the resolutions for the natural and cultural heritage chapter and then we 'll move into the questions that are we received last week from you and we 'll give you some responses for that if there 's any further time after that we can move into more resolutions and take them through from friday so over to you Caroline good morning and so in terms of this the first Christian on the Arthur balance building and you would have received a set of handouts so I just quickly quickly talk you through what they are and the first one as appendix 1 a from the operative city plan and it just sits out what the current listing of that building is and the second one is a statement of significance one with the image on it and it 's Amina will be able to talk to is met the significance threshold for listing in particular details about it and in the third one is a met and that 's the aerial map that were gone the district plan and it shows the outline of the building that is protectors proposed to be protected at number 90 so that 's hopefully quite clear that 's right run the middle of the page so you are interested to know find out more about the building what impact will the proposed scheduling here and what are the plans on the site effectively pattern okay would you like me to talk through what we 've we 've found what we 've got information we can provide to you and so there 's a currently a certificate of compliance and for earthquake investigations and that 's got a further information request on it at the moment that 's where this invested investigative work surround is quite matters and then the second application and at the moment with an request for further information just gone out as for a sign of Jetpack ation and that was triggered because of non-compliances with urban and the first application is the significant of compliance for earthquake investigations so yeah that 's in with the heritage team at the moment we can talk a more detailed if if need be and so just briefly on what 's in terms of the impact of the development am Amanda will be able to talk to you about the detail of why the place has been recognized as significant but if I could just briefly let you know that effectively the proposed buildings are really on the list so what has been proposes and increasing the extent of the listing so what that would mean that an application would be required for works to the building so we are aware of that you see would be an impact but it would be like any other development on a case-by-case assessment and understand their development plans for the whole of the block that I 've where of that through I 'm aware there 's a website link for instance and other than that it would be you know developers information as to what they 're proposing and so all I proposals and at the moment and would you like Amanda hopes to talk through the significance threshold is it right now is so the the building as a whole meets the three shoulder the interior and the exterior we do consider the era still there still heritage fabric on the interior there 's a marble lined staircase there was some original plasterwork remaining I haven 't_''_264.68 been through the building since earthquake so I 'm not aware of the extent of damage to that pass to work and to have a consistent approach across the whole of our listings and a consistent methodology it 's our preference to to us the building as a whole interior and exterior in new rules would impact changes to heritage fabric only so what 's already been changed or lost replaced with new we 're not worried about so and resource consent would be required for alterations to the exterior anyway for this new development so you have the remaining interior features listed it doesn 't actually add an additional content requirement it gives may not eat a requirement to apply for an additional there 's Creed yes Vicki and because I actually asked the developerworks would do if we went ahead with us and his comment is it would just absolutely stuff us up it 's a real it 's a real struggle with all moving parts at the moment and we just do not need any distractions whatsoever I know the building very well because we put a school in there we altered the building interior the interior of it quite significantly in terms of the accessibility of this building on that staircase for in terms of a barrier-free City it needs a lift there is a lift that goes up from the car park Evan to the school area and because that was essential there is no capacity in the current building for people to access by wheelchair I don 't know what survived post-earthquake some of those ceilings were interesting but I don 't know if they 're there you don 't know if they 're there and the exterior of this building has been protected for quite some time so when we did the school on top of it not a problem and the the look and feel of the building on the outside is important but we have a development going in there that is a major major development there are other imperatives and time wise for that developer that we 're very aware of and we cannot we simply cannot do this to another developer in the central city we you said you hadn 't been through the building since the earthquake so we don 't even know what 's left to to actually protect but what we want for this building more than anything I like the building I think it 's lovely building but what we want for it is that it 's a lively heart to a retail precinct of the city and I want their far more than a ceiling which may or may not have survived the earthquake I know that building was incredibly bumpy in the earthquake so I don 't know what survived and all the kids needed but but this would just be unbelievable so do we have in terms of its current status why would we list without why would we do that well we 've done it to the best of our abilities based on that information we have so here I mean surely someone 's been in the building so does anyone anyone know what it 's conditioners I mean we may be protecting something that 's already gone well it 's likely that the heritage fabric has been damaged to some extinct but it 's it 's not likely that it 's totally being obliterated no but the the significance of the repair and the strategy around there may infect hold up the entire development of their whole blog parts that get redesigned it needs lift access which will make quite a big difference to the building and we just completely stuff that major central city development there 's no way and how I can sorry and anyway I can vote for this just I 'm not sure if you 've read the policies which are quite strong on the need for heritage buildings to adapt to modern requirements and code compliance they 're very enabling in that respect and the rules that we 're why do at the same time as we have a time limit on this developer we impose a whole nother set of rules this is a developer who 's actually sponsored Heritage Week for a number of years is actually acutely aware of the significance of the externals of the building has planned around that has been planning this development for what a year 18 months and now suddenly in the middle of it we put a designation over the whole interior of a building without seeing it there are certain elements of the agreement that we have in relation to this matter which are not yet public so I just want to be a little bit cautious about some of this discussion and the public arena not you know not to put too fine a point on it I 'd like to take some legal advice before we go any further on this matter freshness with that and I 'm quite clear that we won 't mention that in public but there is no way partway through a development that we 're aware of that we should be putting we haven 't seen the inside of that 's yeah an actionable but it but I think that there are some that we need to take some advice on and I 'd rather take that offline if you don 't mind Yanni I just think you need to understand what stuff with done in terms of our heritage so what they 've no no no I 'm not going to have this discussion no no the point that I 'm making us is that I want to take some advice and I want to take this offline okay it 's and I 'm not prepared to have this scheduled resolution put at this time we can refer this matter until friday and we can take some advice and glean to a product on friday okay so the idea is that we coming up fri tenders hopefully we can put will be in a position to discuss it on friday but i 'm not prepared to put this resolution today okay i want to take some advice and i 'll talk to you about that time because there are issues that be aware of right and there are also implications for potentially and other heritage buildings as well right so can we ask as a possible then dip it 's coming back on friday that we get stuff to do a site doesn 't get on that fit was one of the committee 's the site wasn 't no yeah anyway the thing is is that there are other issues in relation to this particular measure the point that was made was how can you list a building that you haven 't seen the inside of which i think is a valid point is that we do not want the interior of this building to have to go through any more hurdles we actually want some retail in the retail heart of our city it would be more nice but the but the point is that we actually don 't know what the set of interior is and we 've been asked to list of so I think it 's perfectly reasonable to ask we can go inside the interior anyway there are a number of steps that we can take some legal advice because I 'm a little bit concerned about the situation that we may find ourselves that 's fine think we 'll do that on friday so if I could ask that we could continue to the end of the resolutions for the natural and cultural heritage chapter since we 're on that chapter yes so just on this trip there 's a two sets of hand out so just ask Kimberly to hand out the first set so in that package of information you 'll be receiving a set of changes to the provisions which relate to the resolutions it changes to be some changes to the appendices and in european mix just doing a polity really could I hit one just an apology early departure DN I 've got to go to beat them for the hasn 't asked so this meetings going to what are we anticipating nine o 'clock okay elected in the coffin apostate _"

    "text": "em up this morning the Alpha bonnet building and the bits building I 've just had a chance to actually talk to the developer completely and aware of it and it stuffs up everything so can we just be aware that when that comes back I will certainly move that it comes out what 's this the arthur ban it beats building they came out this morning I wasn 't here obviously to know we were going to raise that in come back with further information you found out about the timeline that 's great there are a couple of other questions about that building so when we do the recommendations the following Friday that 's when the committee would need to discuss whether or not it wants to pull out that world item we jibba dope we won 't jeopardize the entire development to build sorry I have no idea what you 're talking about that the issue that issue was that the suggestion was that the Arthur ballot beefs Belding the Old Earth Balance building become a heritage-listed building if for the entirety of the building not just alterations inside as you can imagine they want to do for the whole new development down there they would have to come back and get special resource consents and things and what they 're building was already cat do I see used to be a Mesa building when I was occurred was already covered the building has been cut in half has been being completely real turd we 've added to stories to it when we built the school there is nothing there is not very much that its heritage about it unless the 1990s suddenly heritage so the exterior yes no problem but just the signal that I 'm giving is that we simply cannot do that and have that retail precinct ie8 are you talking about is the crossing site you 're saying that the stops the crowd could potentially compromise the crossing development there would be nonsense okay I agree completely so it was why we 're getting more information to you we haven 't passed any recommendations on it sidered Nixon Friday just eluding your nosey of listeria so when you come back to us can the on the issue I mean I to take you through the papers and assessment reports and things like that okay if they 're all online everything is online all right plus plus the 6,000 our technical reports there are only two copies of them in there on both sides of the room here right the technical ones are alive yes sir it that all I 'm not everything is online okay seem to link to heritage once the next one can be sure it 'll run to the Heritage Month case one there 's um one more item one more item for any woman 's very yes now um you will have received there are four chapters that 's rural open space transport and subdivision which now have a part of them in stage three and i don 't want to spend a whole lot of time on this but if i click through it most of rural for example all the gray is in stage two what is in stage three is simply with is a objective policy of rule that relates to the chapters and stage 3 rules that were coming out on the stage three so that 's all that is meant by consequential amendments is that the stage two chapters have been amendment amended now so that they can include stuff in them for stage 3 so is there anything of any controversial nature or anything that you 're sneaking and that we might not be expecting or not that i 'm aware of i can give you an example not a sneaky yeah I wasn 't okay give you an examiner if you can find rural and your stage three box I don 't mix I don 't even think I didn 't know what you mean by consequential amendments so I don 't burn them all that 's fine I can show you I 'll just find something look for anything that 's in black yep so what does this do in the rules own yeah sorry yeah oh right okay so so these are all relevant to stage three chapters so there are men months to stage two chapters that we have already signed off but they pick up for example coastal and that 's actually really not much more than that it 's so additions and additions into the state they will come into those chapters like stage no chapters built form stand up exactly except etc so that relates a cultural natural heritage or natural hazards stage through if everyone can just go through these and have a hit us was if they are if there are any issues we can pop them on rush on this and we 'll deal with this is and that 's just one simple question that 's on quarrying not surprisingly is there any way in which we can tighten the rules on querying at the stage on this no okay the rules on acquiring have gone through in stage two which have all signed off now and they 'll be notified on May the first second all right so all right so I think that 's probably it for the day thank you yes what well the transport is the same its transport open space and subdivision and rural or which have not sequential Amin medicine Matt 's our board is particularly concerned it 's really unclear because the central city accessible transport plan didn 't really have that level of detail but then we told that it 's part of the cycleways plan then we told it 's part of the central city recovery plan so I just want to check is it of the district plan is at how this amendment that you 're proposing headphone nation belly yeah I was not aware of it but yeah it 's not in the district plan so if we can have information i 'm back on page 32 what that means for 32 and the chapter page 32 on Chapter seven just in that blue box oh yeah so just in terms of Worcester straight what status we 're giving it through the district plan sure that would be great and what that means in terms of its of culture very good so everyone now understands that with these four chapters the bits that are and dark are actually the stage three notifications included in their individual chapters so if there are any questions or issues if we could notify those yep just on tuesday so it 's and she put a couple rivers even from has been seen to us here all these iconic lee yeah it was very out so I mean next week it 's going to be challenging with respect to making sure that we 've got enough time to complete these so minimum ticket I suggest that on the Wednesday we deal with some of the issues that have already been raised today where people are wanting more information yep and then next Friday I 'm trying to see if I can get James Winchester here to give you a briefing on how the residential hearings have gone because that will impact on for instance the issues you raise today about for example what was it some of those community facilities being permitted in some of the zones fire stations but there was also the other one that 's right that 's right so that might give you a heads up on that and then we still have the briefing on natural hazards stage two which is going into stage-three to do as well as the recommendations so let 's have a look so how long do we need on Wednesday morning I would think you might need because we 're going to go through the recommendations I think you need at least an hour more than the two hours that are already in your diary well that can 't happen because of meetings and the people 's diary so so it 's at the DPR subcommittee is only in my diary for one hour at this moment so on friday on thurs wednesday yes one hour on wednesday until I asked you how much time do we need on windstar sorry yeah I thought you said Friday and Wednesday an hour we 'll do it we 'll do you you wouldn 't want to do anything else on the winds day like maybe get the lawyer briefing then well we could in Zaun when they 're available I 've got an email and to them and i haven 't had a response yet um if you have got extra time on wednesday i 'm always happy to bring things forward yeah do you think it starts at wednesday you got your task force on homelessness clean bed at nine oh okay all right i got in beacon up so what how many people come in so that that 's one hour and then on the Friday that works okay we 've got a chief executive an employment matters subcommittee from one o 'clock tool 3 o 'clocks as two hours there we we have another briefing in the afternoon so I think going beyond 1 o 'clocks going to be very difficult on the Friday is it going to be enough time I hope so all right do you want to study earlier well earlier than eight o 'clock at nine o 'clock nine o 'clock on friday will it started at eight o 'clock be fine Kate would ya be raped yep thank you yeah eight o 'clock it 's deliver yep yes you 're here yeah but we 'll start at eight o 'clock them all try and get it all done by living but if we can 't we might have to the benefit of those who may have meetings later on which would of the natural hazards or go into the recommendations for all of those chapters we 've been through and then do the presentation on natural hazards that 's fine we could do that but that like we might be able to do that on Wednesday know let 's let 's deal with it on wednesday cuz look I don 't want to hold things up as the other any things that we could resolve on Wednesday I mean you could go through any of the recommendations for the presentations that you 've seen today okay well we learned it without ever now let 's see if people could identify are there any chapters that there are that people are comfortable with the recommendations because if we can if we could literally get you know it 's kind of clear the decks then on Friday we could really give natural hazards that what it deserves and I think it 's that 's the biggest issue facing Christchurch really I mean and or in actually an advanced question took for you to think about the natural hazards as why tsunami is not the residential stage one the tsunamis met saw already went out as part of stage one you but why aren 't they included on natural hazards I mean it just seems it lost but i 'll check that just let me check that it has already gone out but i 'll check whether it 's your button it just seems odd that when you 're doing a natural hazards chapter that you wouldn 't have tsunami Rusk is a natural hazard it 's all I 've been to it and had some discussion with Helen and there are Anton I 'm speaking there are some awesome other parts of the head which were on David I 'm speaking um what 's related is really important bit yeah and the other chapters I 'm sure how long i 'll explain me through our definitions of what has a doll I thought tsunami to be there too it should be in my view it should be mentioned on the and then and the natural hazards chapter I mean the this was I can 't imagine why lines are on one chapter kooldaddy if a guy that 's gone out on the stage or I 'm working to advance water yep I want to know about tsunamis as well now there are a lot of questions that were raised today so I 'm not sure when you want me to go through them on Wednesday or on Friday we 're going to try and do as much of it as we can on Wednesday so if we could if we could do this can do the build our third Burnitz building or whatever it 's called DIC building yes is yes and well it depends whether they could get the lawyer down yes as there is there anything else that we could definitely clear the decks with on Wednesday if people could just like seriously if there aren 't issues like that their whole of that the specific purpose plan within a social and cultural heritage chapter we basically have done all of these that shouldn 't take any time at all we could will have as many recommendations up there as young get through or just you just get them all together I just confirm as it 's still just one hour on wednesday unfortunately I have to tragically agree with that because others have important meetings from their Diaries already in Friday starts at eight now Friday go through too late yep yeah if you could get that and to the thing although there are some people who have got meetings win on Friday named recovery you couldn 't tip that out wee bit further or alternatively we could break at eleven o 'clock and come back it at 12 or something would that work is that I mean when is that window the Friday so if we could break it break it break it eleven o 'clock yes and come back at midday yes and go for another hour ok so it 's eight till 11 and then 12 to one yeah ok cool and if I could just alert you you will be receiving some more papers tonight particularly the finalized tonkin and taylor report which is still confidential great thank you yes so people be able to take a hard copy home with them it 's being couriered think it 's because it hasn 't been peer reviewed yet is that it 's correct it hasn 't been peer reviewed it yeah alright so if I could just one small plea is just to remind you to bring your papers then for the next few days particularly the mex because it is expensive continually printing things to make Spears available yes well yeah well I 'm not going to go into what I think about this process but will will will will try and do our best thank you of course you can yeah I don 't think anyone 's taking any of this home over the weekend not the slot anyway _"

    "text": "and you 've also had a previous presentation on coastal environment but you might recall last week we two weeks ago when we started the stage two chapters we decided to delay this to stage three so there could be connections made up necessary to other stage three chapters for example natural hazards and natural and cultural heritage so Fiona or just briefly go through this again and make those connections for you or answer any questions unfortunately you won 't be getting natural hazards until next Friday is nice that 's right no no resolution today thank you sheet afternoon everybody right yeah as Brigitte explained you 've already had this presentation to you so I 'll keep it relatively brief and just highlight the key points the key points I 'm leading the second part of the natural hazards chapter and of course you also see now that it 's been delayed its coinciding with the release of the natural and cultural heritage chapter which I think it 's a lot of value because a lot of questions that we 've had from the minister 's representatives and answered by the natural and cultural heritage chapter so just moving along that the chapter affects the direction and high-level documents like the New Zealand coastal policy statement and the the Canterbury regional policy statement the new New Zealand policy statement issued into 2010 updates the earlier one and it provides a lot more guidance to the council now that prepares its replacement plan in particular it 's giving policy direction on the extent and characteristics of the coastal environment heritage and treaty matters public open space land or water held under other acts and legislation indigenous biodiversity preservation of an actual character coastal had hesitant evens the regional policy statement provides that a similar direction in terms of objectives and policies including increasing knowledge and awareness of coastal matters we 've also benefited from new information that 's been commissioned to inform other chapters in particular and of course you 're aware of information on coastal hazards that term we 've also had commissioned what does the chapter carry like that what 's the chapter look like you can move along with now has a an overarching fairly slim the coastal environment by way of an overlay and the objectives and policies provide guidance on any development under other zones or other district-wide rules that apply within that overlay there 's a very slim Coastal Zone which rolls over many of the provisions and the existing conservation one a zone and the operative city plan and so that zone largely covers those high use recreational habitat areas are joining the city so with the exception of the coastal zone this chapter is largely relying on other zones and district wide rules to implement its policies so it 's rather unique in the overall district plan in that regard to get an idea of whether coastal environment overlay occurs there 's a high level diagram of course when you look at the planning maps you 'll see that the coastal environment that the land would extent all that notated on all those maps that are join or overlap the coastal marine area boundary of the territorial boundary along the coastline to determine the coastal environment we used our technical experts to assess a number of characters or criteria in terms hazards the interaction the coastal marine area of the boundary which does mean high water Springs access to the coast by road and recreational land in that area and also items of historic heritage value and to overall we applied a practical and reasonable approach to try and provide an outcome that and provide some clarity to landowners and the general public about what 's proposed and to be able to head something that 's justified and defensible so if we if we look at that just before we move on i 'll just point to a little area hold my hand steady if i can just along the top there and largely that 's sort of the part that adjoins the christchurch city area and that 's the part over which the coastal zone applies within i should say it 's not all of that area but it 's within that general area north of the the avett ithaca nestor e just move along to the next slide you 'll see the coastal zone yep and it next one over we 'll just move along again please and you very limited provision for activities and that area is largely owned by the the public managed by the council and it rolls over existing provisions as in the operative plan as i said earlier and that 's generally providing for what accord broadly or defined conservation activities which i 'd rather describers habitat management and some recreational activities passive recreation activities which are seating tables that sort of the likes and then we 've got recognition of things like the surf yacht club and the lights Coast Guard facilities that sort of thing they need to go through a consent process if they want to upgrade or extend otherwise it 's very much sort of business as usual in many ways you know that 's it did a consenting process within the council no it would be the normal consenting process so it 's through Environment Canterbury as oh no through throughout something I 'm sorry yeah yes yeah because I 'm just one about the pier at new brush on because it doesn 't kind of happily fit within any of those descriptions with the library and cafe it category in the if you look at the zone provisions for marine structures and I think that from memory the definition effectively says that at some structures that are owned by the council haven 't provided the definition there but if you have a copy of your definitions you 'll see that marine structures applies to structure is owned by the council I suspect in that situation because we 've the pier is or solely eight located in the water beyond mean high water Springs there would be a joint consent process required for that and of course we do that sort of thing all the time we could that there 's a library and cafe assoc oh that 's not just a just that here the marine structure as it were since right I 'm not sure in terms of the practical application and that regard but air concede people are dealing with that sort of thing all the time so it will be I just know that the community you know has has a desire to look at some other options on on the on the foreshore therefore but on the car park yes so but that they would it would just require consent that 's yes and if it doesn 't go out beyond mean high water yes I 'd have to check the map to actually see whether the library facility fell within the coastal zone i 'm not entirely sure that it does i think it might be slightly land would of that zone okay mmm alright so it 's not very far and to the effectively the back of the june sir beccaroon system or this yet and of course a wee bit because there 's a cat emerging system that 's right so that 's why i 'm not entirely wrong sorry about that okay and i think he yeah any did you have a question um I 'm just just in regards to the information that we 've had that there 's certain provision where coastal areas if they if they if the land changes and gets to a certain point attributes to chrome title this is the stuff that Hugh Christensen the Hugo 's been emailing us about is it covered is but we don 't actually deal with it here per se it 's this is not the area to deal with it but certainly it 's the unit manager Helen Beaumonts been dealing with mr. Christensen on their suits so just in terms of our district play and is there anything that we need to be thinking of either putting in or taking our that would give some clarity over those properties I 'm not totally familiar with the concern you 're raising but i think it is largely dressed with under other legislation on my understanding in simple terms of the lens dropped to a certain point certain high yes then that landing reverts to crown title because it 's part becomes part of the coastal area because it 's so low yeah I accept that there is legislation governing that I just don 't know the details of it if you need that clarified you know we can think of motor just get something back before we make the final decision yeah okay yep so I 'm this one within the plan is the reasoning which you sort of familiar with places where it 's car and it does a play on a plane all alpha like the cats say to be restored some hell yes yes it does cuts in the June I 'm sorry I didn 't quite hear got in June you see I 'm coming from the point of view obviously of preventing tsunami yes yes it does but the anything that there 's a threshold in terms of them earthworks and and and that would probably trigger a resource consent and that the council itself operates or managers at June 's under resource consent it currently has from the Regional Council and so a similar process would be invoked through any movement of over the certain threshold which I think there 's something like 50 square meters that came out of the girl in the wheelchair our from a number of North Beach people to try and put a walkway along with in the dunes with in the 55-meter area of the dunes in North Beach would that be in any way constrained by that should be again if you check you ways in there okay so you could again you know that would be under the jurisdiction of the council 's management of those areas David I just want to clarify the talk about cutting in june 's at the moments in periods of high storm yes we do get a line that cuts down on the journey and really it depends on the height of the June where the cutters higher or lower there 's no distinction that C makes no distinction between the height it 's just a straight line down the beach and the higher the June the higher the escarpment longer it takes to appear the lower the June the quicker appears it was my inappropriate use of the word capped what I meant was that the June systems been cut out completely wheel appears being built with a library and everything as there is no junior system other yeah that 's all I was referring to I wasn 't talking about same analogy applies the erosion that where the dunes have been cut out is no different to where it 's the line no but all the coastal zone and that 's what we 're going to get clarified because we don 't know how far back it goes well let that in itself is quite quite a problem because in varying parts of the coastline the accretion is bigger than others do you know I don 't tell you that the coastline it has it by his place there is accreting at the rate of two meters a year you know we know that it ladies hair that 's cool why my career in reverse line when we 're creaking all the time no no it 's it 's it 's we 're it it 's where the base pointers so it 's what 's in front of it of the toe is moving out into the sea all the time our coastline the line is going to be continually moving yeah that 's right but no not necessarily if the back at the end point of the back point is the arms is but base of the it 's not going to change hi what will change will be the seaward side that 's back point now we 're going to work well we 've largely relied on the existing zoning of the conservation 1a zone and that largely runs along the back of it isss let 's see decades old as it is it 's just it 's just a pragmatic pragmatic management approach those days planning but complicated for local residents when they want to do something well let cool say it 's public land too so you know yeah I 'm not quite some of the sum of some properties there would trends pose the your back of the sangean line further down yeah there is that there is a very indistinct boundary between the coastline and in those properties down the end of rocking your throat yeah absolutely so it 's quite what a pragmatic problem down there we you are creating an arbitrary line that 9999 closes we 'll take a number of properties I think it 's inappropriate to say you are creating an arbitrary 9 the truth is that we are required to have a coastal environment it exists and and there is an area where it I mean when you 're when you 're crossing when you 're in a in a kayak and you 're going across the the history then at some point you move from the crushes or the bank 's furniture electra and unto the christ church Easter literate but I bet you can 't see that line so I mean sometimes you know a line on a map in terms of what you can see on the ground it isn 't clear and that 's why we encourage people to make submissions where they may have a property with a line where they think the line is in the wrong place i should put a submission and yep can I are you starting to ask a question it 's around just a clarification for people around list do we do in terms of doing measurements which cert req the movement in terms of so that in fact is like a zone around the dunes do we help do have key points so we know that we 're infected there is monitoring carried out by the Regional Council in terms of the system there that hasn 't to say informed the boundary of the zone but has certainly informed the assessment of coastal hazards in that area so we look at those things when we come to to hear and hesitantly that 's enabled you know the measurement of the breach profile over decades yeah for about 30 years thank you every century there was no see hmm because it 's so relevant so no just just moving on to this slide here that shows another little piece of the coastal zone at Taylor 's mistake with as a mix their of the sandy and rocky shoreline and the batch settlements effectively are also caught by this coastal zone you 've heard a lot about that aspect of the zone through the residential chapter and the actual batches are scheduled end and the mappers attached to the zone as well so we 're sort of a good again another sort of cross this is what the Working Party did but yeah that 's right the residential chapter doubt with the batches themselves yeah okay jaani just wanted to check on those batches mm-hmm well I thought we notified on the signet may I thought the book but people I 've talked to you from the batches said that they 've already been going to the independent hearings pedal ah that was in relation to those batches that are affected by slope stability hazards as part of the first part of the natural hazards chapter so yes took so where 's that got turned to the independent there 's no decision being made by the independent hearings panel at the stage okay and then the other thing that I was raised with us probably some time ago was the need to protect or maybe recognize special surfing sites within Christchurch remember AV recall that deputation or submission we head to council where the surfers actually wanted us to acknowledge areas along the coast that were special for surfing that 's something I just wanted to see where that he got tune if they had feed-in off which is probably appropriate yeah I mean that will be lean word of the council 's territorial boundary which has mean high water Springs or them yeah II would ya with only the environment Canterbury 's jurisdiction 30 coastal management area they can write oh ok and this is just showing you a shot of vaca Roran and I 'm at the stage very picturesque and you know some settlements are also located within the policy coastal environment overlay we 're but an open mind about that but again it 's only those activities that trigger a resource consent which would then be considered also under these two objectives and policies and this chapter yeah this one is on so we need to put in more objectives about little term about reverse sensitivity that is dealt with through actually through i think the the residential chapter there 's already look reasonably restricted controls on development in that area and the little son settlement and the noise sensitivity activities that 's dealt with in that chapter in between opportunity andrew being away at the time I 've got a proposed memorandum for you which I haven 't signed off yet but it 's coming so just just basically we discussed this the other day and we 're very 'd raise the issue so I 'm going to be sending you a memo about how we might encourage people when the little turn area to make actually make submissions to the to the independent hearings panel on the subject yeah it was just it was just in that policy one page 13 yes um so we 're accepting within the e rock you pie by the court of little turn and in light of the changes that we made what page to page do team I think chapter 19 yeah so we 're excluding the port from I doesn 't go that far nature 's go it 's in the section 32 I 'll sorry oh we 're not referring to the Church of the first page of the Kepler probably so it excludes the poor from things like nature 's go intensity and in location preserves and heart is the natural character and heritage of coastal environment and then goes so it excludes it from quite a lot and but it 's not mentioned around the reverse simple quite limiting the reverse infertility issues on the coastal area and be consistent so I just wanted if you 've looked at we have looked at that and we 've tried to work in with other chapters and particularly when we first looked at that we were consider were considering given to a special port zone course now i think the street in a recent decision somebody can correct me if I 'm wrong that a recovery plan is going to be provided for the airport so we 'll continue to keep their mind if we need to alter that policy to recognize it but as I said that you know those port sensitive activities after being addressed through the residential chapter and that 's non I continued from the existing provisions I 'd like it 's like I personally feel that we shall exclude the report because I think the relationship physical environment is really critical hmm yeah they 're really nice and number nation that 's why the that 's why the little turn port recovery planners as being led by a cane that 's what I thought well then maybe we should just when it comes back on why we would give the poor special exemptions and this policy that there 's another process underway because my preference would be to leave the port is not being accepted because I actually think the things in here actually really important regardless of whether the port 's there or not well it 's it 's a working port so you can 't put all of these overlays on a working port that the working poor issues are being dealt with in two other chapters one as residential and the other as is the little to import recovery plan it 's not part of the district Plainridge oh yeah but it will be it will be it would be submitted when it 's completed it will be loaded but we haven 't met a submission around there no I know why would we be putting things in digestion if I already agreed last week or earlier this week that we would not we know us we wouldn 't you not do no no no we wouldn 't submit it now we would submit the plan that is completed once it be dealt with in the timeframe exceptions and now a hit of that process eight of us even having a collective so there 's no reason why we can 't amend this later if that was the appropriate thing to do but there is there 's no way that you can make the port of Littleton subject to all of these requirements when we know that it 's going to be dealt with in another way that 's the point of making so we 've agreed not to do it as part of the yard so if you 're a member of the public you learn a little something and you get this coming through your litter box you 're probably likely to make submissions but the whole point of what we did last week was to have one process to determine what I don 't think anyone 's going to think that this is a separate process from there I mean what why on earth would they I 've already just highlighted that there are some noise issues that need to be addressed and we 're going to talk regard I just I can 't see the point of creating a coastal environment policy conflict which would be a conflict if we ended up and left the situation through you madam chair out we could suggest potentially as just take out leave the policy but take out the words except within the area occupied by the port of Littleton so that it so that the policy just relates to all infrastructure so we could actually if I could carry on there that something that we 've benefited from is that this was was a stage 2 chapter it did it has received minister 's comments and one of the strong comments coming through that I was going to make a recommendation on is to after the word development in this policy 19 13 is to say including infrastructure because the ministers are asking for recognition of infrastructure in the coastal environment and that might be a way of kind of trading off the concerns that counselor Johansson hairs by taking out that exception part so where does the infrastructure go on so after we 'd say ensure that subdivision at a scale and drop the wording except within their area occupied by the porter little turn so it 's not singling out port of liquid Littleton per se but it is giving recognition to infrastructure including and generalizes that more except there it then you 've got the port I mean I agree with the S weeks but it you 've got a porch there has to be of a nature scale intensity and location that preserves and enhances the natural character and heritage of the coastal environment when in fact it 's a working really sorry and I mean the reality is that anything in the littleton port recovery plan that conflicts with this will override it anyway the council has got the ability to coming up in the next couple of weeks to make its submission on the Littleton port recovery plan the submission panel and meeting tabled and it 's actually a joint submissions panel between the council 's working group and the submissions panel so it 'll be plenty of opportunity to make comments on the port recovery plan aspect of this at that time the statutory nature of the recovery plan will override anything in the district plan review chapters anyway if so I think that needs to be understood in the context of discussion that we 're having um yeah so um I just want us to be a vote on page 7 what can we deal with this piece I mean is that are we going to leave those weeds and don 't take them out no no I know that 's what and end us I mean I you know okay all right yep till I 'm page 7 I just want to flag this I had some discussion with him about natural hazards carpet and on page 7 and the other button the coastal environment chip 19 document with the reference to reduced risk from hazards and as issue number three and it 's the threateners including coastal erosion and there 's likely to be exacerbated by climate change and it 's my understanding that in fact that specifically that should be erosion from some area some parts and in it the sediment or seen Sam moves to other parts letting it really you might deal with the natural hazards part to bloggers if it seems know that there probably isn 't entirely specifically can i clarify you know what are displaying are you get a thick and thin to listen for what and it okay to you on 00 which document check the 1960s vide to i cry sorry name what page page CH even just playing it and I don 't don 't wanna start a whole great big debate about it because life is another got anything I 'm aware of your discussion and you 're quite right and and we can amend that no it 's a damn sea level rises not the only cause of erosion on the coast basically it 's what you 're saying and you 're quite correct okay thank you good all right next one yeah ok _"

    "text": "the actual chapter and the section 32 documents were posted out to us with the maps and the other chapters that we 've been talking about today on the sides of the room here you 'll see boxes of enormous material enormous files those are the 6,000 odd pages that also make up the section 32 they 're the assessments of all of the scheduling activities and the items and the schedules for natural and cultural heritage because of the cost of all of the printing we have simply made three of those copies and we 'll leave it here for you to peruse at any time or if you want to see it outside of outside of chambers you 're welcome to come and see me or I can leave a set up in the counselors chambers they are of course confidential at this stage and they are available online sorry then they 're not confidential they 're available online right yep our way okay good afternoon my name is Caroline Rachlin and so I 'm going to present you on the lecture on cultural here it is chapter their various topics and I 'll get you to come up to the table at each specific topic area so just briefly to talk through you 've received that package of information which includes the chapter the chapter section 52 and also just really wanted to bring to your attention before we start the proposed schedule of all the proposed listed items that 's a very important component of the chapter as well as the clinic maps and the aerial maps for here to show the extent of the heritage items and settings proposed so the chapter covers lordly those five topic areas of landscapes stark heritage areas of natural character in the coastal environment ecosystems and biodiversity in trees they 'll just talk you through the context and process and just briefly so for this chapter should be some bullet points out there that they 've have come off some reason these are important places and features within the district to protect and they 're informed for instance significant trees heritage buildings and sites of ecological significance now there 's been much a technical assessment were to underpin YH it 's contained in the section 32 documentation no places that are special and important to the district for economic cultural natural environment reasons across and they cover a broad range of geographical areas across the district in overlay the different zones so an important thing to point out to you as we develop the scope of this chapter and I think I 've mentioned this before on a previous occasion that the provisions have been drafted considering the ability to use non-regulatory end-rig ettore methods and what has been proposed for the district plan really draws on the fact that we have advice assistance for instance grants available for heritage buildings planning officers and experts available to provide advice so we rely on rules but also on the methods outside of the plan so the first topic area to run through and just to point out the key points in the key points of difference to the existing plan as around the landscapes and features and natural character and the coastal environment so I might see if hennaed Lewthwaite could join us hennas our senior landscape planner we 've chapter chapter 9 chapter 9 yes so chapter 9 I 've spoken to you about chapter 9 before yes I hopefully a lot of this as a recap or building up what you 've already heard before so and some of us a lot of it comes up and chapter 13 as well still central city so just to excuse me for being just slightly dumb at the moment so what did we do before that would that what didn 't we do before that we 're doing now you know so what 's the difference between what went before and what 's now okay so it 's been a previous briefing yeah and so this really does recap on that and no okay so nothing 's been notified as such originally this was going to come forward in stage two you might recall and for various reasons and also they need to have more time to do some of the assessments it was delayed until stage 3 which is why you 've already had one briefing on it right and so if you just that it looked very familiar it and then it got delayed to stage three okay but they were I mean we are asked and answered a number of questions and their context curry okay so this this may not take as long as the extent of the documentation might under k okay right Carol okay so I 'm just broadly in this topic area there 's three main areas outstanding natural features and landscapes and significant features and landscapes areas of natural character and the coast and a policy framework for the identification of future significant landscapes so highlighted there is it that our new outstanding natural and features proposed particularly in the Christchurch area it 's a couple of examples noted the outstanding status is been determined through landscape expert work which hannah can expand on if you need that some of the extent of the arena fouls have been amended that predominately on the banks peninsula yeah those are quite a lot of discussion around there wasn 't there yeah yeah and there 's some new significant features and landscapes and its many of the Christchurch area but also on parts of the you have in all the planning Maps yep so in the chapter that you have with with you chapter 9 chapter 9 it now that it doesn 't apply to the landscape section but it does apply to the in case you 're wondering why some of the ticks are shown of blue now that applies to the indigenous biodiversity section 9.1 and historic heritage section 9.3 and because of section 86 and the RMA because of that some of these rules will have immediate effect immediately ghal effective time of notification so that 's that 's to highlight that particular point so that 's just a matter of process under the RMA that as soon as we notified that takes effect but that could be over tuned afterwards or yes well yes because it still has to go through the proper submissions rises but it 's the idea that you don 't sort of Russian and the chop down a whole lot of trees or destroy the outstanding natural landscape yeah okay cool got that the next topic areas areas of natural character in the coasts so there has and at least high natural character and that 's it 's built to an extent on the operative plan and that 's really derived primarily from requirements of the New Zealand coastal policy statement and there 's rules a rule framework and policy framework for all of these areas to identify and manage them so I 've just put a brief snapshot on this next slide about generally for these topic areas that identify them the planning Maps they 're listed in the schedules informed by landscape assessment work there 's a policy framework for the three topic areas and something particular to note is that the qualities of each of these play as identified in the policies of the chapter for the landscape section so you 'll see that for instance record and bush for instance support Hills sets out why they 're important so there are rules to manage a range of development types of development across these areas ranging from some with firm that had standards through to discretionary non-compliant for instance in reliance but in some reliance on rules of the zone based chapters would you now this is me before I do that this is an example of the actually my piano would you like to explain that mech probably seasonally Caroline and I think you may have some of you might have seen us before I think we 're here but I 'm happy to go over it because I think the key points are that you can see the landscape overlays work sure in the people which is the outstanding the light blue which is high coastal character natural character and the magenta color which has the outstanding coastal natural character now those are overlays over the existing and underlying rural zone so what Caroline is referring to is where those overlays for landscape or coastal natural character reasons have been identified they rely on rules and the underlying zone primarily but introduce a strong object and policy direction listing the qualities of where those overlays are there or it means at the time of developmental end-use it 's essentially the system that 's being used so it 's making sure the important qualified qualities are identified have appropriate direction and at the thank you um so the next topic is historic heritage so much stuff swap too fancy and then to ice yep patient to just what you win over it it 's on page 13 and it was the outstanding feature natural feature of Brooklyn 's lagoons but so it 's just simply that the description of one is that the land form of the spindle ago I like the distinctive feature and I 'm just wondering it is there any reason that dooms bet that dooms themselves as a barrier and not also part of that distinctive feature or this is I it 's on chip anoint a cage thirty nine point two point two point five policy outstanding natural feature Brooklyn 's lagoon ends but so to clarify what you 're asking the outstanding natural feature covers the whole of the area that some councils jurisdiction from mean high water springs back through to the rural land and you can see that on the online maps and the schedule to chapter 13 are you asking about within that outstanding area or the area to the south where the genes dunes themselves being included okay so within the brooklands outstanding natural feature it does include gem systems wheatland Madeleine mud Fletch rather areas and then to the south there 's an area of Jones along the coast that have been identified as a significant feature so I 'm not aware that any jeans so that 's why it 's great just how it was weird that I doesn 't like their bday the landform behind that Jason 's formed behind the dunes barrier and I just sort of inferred that it was possible to in fact it didn 't include the turn so as you 're saying look in fact on the maps it does it does because it 's the maps that have the yeast overlay and you should have the printing max what 's your now still from this morning all right no good question thank you okay okay so the next topic is stark heritage so we 've been through this before but I 'll I 'll run through this key points so as a policy framework proposed to work with no chahu to identify sites of so that 's for a future work program the one of the key principles in relation to heritage items being buildings bridges and the like as enabling the ongoing and adaptive youth so they can be continued to use used in the future in the heritage items as I was mentioned earlier and under Chapter 13 section 12 as they 've been structured around a two-group classification group one high significance group two significant that is in contrast notably to the city plan which is a four group classification the provisions have been based around heritage conservation management and heritage principles and there is a policy to that effect and in that section of the chapter the total of four hundred and ninety proposed heritage items to be listed now that number doesn 't include those in the central city and that can be covered separately as neatly but and amanda 's are able to speak to the detail on the numbers proposed proposed free deleted or amended for instance just given your snapshot there I mean the other point to note in their documentation that 's available is the an item setting to be protected and similar to the landscape studies and this work has been informed by heritage assessment work so each and every heritage place has its own so it 's about a five or six page statement of significance there 's a lot of work gone into and to developing these statements and the schedules so in terms of the rules there 's rules for items and settings and it 's quite different to the existing plan in which the rules relied on development on the site of the heritage building and it 's different and respect of the use of the word sitting but it 's quite similar an approach in that front since new buildings on the site of a heritage building which would now be new buildings on a sitting would still require consent the provisions are very enabling around repairs and maintenance for heritage buildings and that that 's actually permitted with a number of standards there 's a non-compliant status for demolition of heritage items for group 1 and group 2 items in a controlled activity status for heritage upgrade work fire and access and silent file areas as they have been rolled over from the operative banks peninsula district plan so those shown on the planning maps also in this rules in place for them and that 's about the sites of cultural significance tonight IV that are encompassed on a broader geographic area but are not specifically detailed in the plan so that I think we 've discussed before that effectively acts as a trigger yep to have that consultation and consent process and similar to the process policy for landscapes and Heritage Areas sorry there 's a future work program for heritage areas with the policy framework established so that that 's all on the heritage and these are autumn blue as well so these are immediately operative on notification that 's correct yes oh sorry not immediately operative that has immediate legal effect very legal opinion yeah so it 's a technical measure and then what that means is that the operative provisions still apply but it 's a weighting issue as to how much weight is given to the proposed provisions and the operative provisions thank think we went through this in detail the last time so all good trees with a long discussion about trees last time and there is a topic on ecosystems and biodiversity before the trace time is it goes straight from heritage to significant trees and meijer essential reason one of the slides is missing yeah I bet hang on I haven 't got I 'm not referring to the slide I 'm talking to the chapter chapter three chapter 9 goes from nine point three which is heritage historic heritage matters of control 29.4 significant trees yes so I structured the presentation slightly differently to do that to the oil to check yes their presentation matter so Andrew could come speak to the later two topics of biodiversity and trees so I assume that most of you read that indigenous biodiversity section new chapter so perhaps I 'll start there sorry with what page is there in the chapter section you want it there it 's it babe do you boys are 51 I 'll just before we get into that just introduce alleged arson who 's our principal advisor I done something wrong bow fronted by dressing sorry Ross it 's actually on page two it 's a very start of projector and dizziness biodiversity well that 's why I couldn 't find it right thank you okay so you haven 't got a slide on it I had one copy maybe is it maybe it 's at the beginning of your presentation no it 's been a technical glitch cuz it prepared a slide on it but yeah okay I have a copy of in front of me I think we have talked about us yeah before so I flip this around run through what it already so yes okay the regional policy statement requires us to protect a significant and dangerous vegetation and we 've done it through applying the criteria and the rps to a range of sites across the district 103 sites and totally proposing to protect both in the what was the city and what was Ben 's peninsula and though Liz can talk more about the other criteria are and we 're perhaps we those some of those places are but I think them so large areas of native bush to something that might be a habitat like three pine trees some weather a habitat and avon river as a habitat and the rules try to just manage activities within those areas the rules also again this is something the obvious requires us to do the the rules project other indigenous vegetation so that might be areas where we haven 't surveyed yet and well weird there might be a discovery of something living in a particular habitat that we 're not yet aware of so there are rules are in protecting those those areas and the rules do permit people to do some things so there 's a rule around doing some minor pruning to trees and in removal of trees where there 's a threat to public safety that sort of thing that 's a I get a quick run through do you have anything same thing about the now that 's significant trees but throws a similar all integers by diversey where if it 's a threat to public safety say it 's near a walking track or a road somebody and I just bring to your attention again the maps and the planning maps and all the assessment reports on the side of the room here and if you like to check on any particular dress or any particular item will start on trees and thank you I would be the wreck on trees is seen to ground really reviewing the lists of protected trees and an existing plane set a sea plane in the bank 's plan we 've developed a much more robust and consistent method for doing that and we 're only protecting trees that are actually properly significant and only those on private land will be listed we are still protecting trees in the public realm through some more general provisions around to heighten species so that we ensure we keep those ones that we still do want bearing in mind that some of those could still be significant just to interrupt this is page 50 and so I forget how many trees we did have listed but now on private land will have 380 and then there 's four groups of trees as well hang on doesn 't mean and again that those rules around allowing people to do some minor pruning and fell in with our safety issues just on the trace it 's a possible ask a question yep so I mean I 'm just really concerned at the huge number reduction in terms of what we have listed to live in 50 down to 380 is quite difficult so that there 's two aspects that one is that the existing lists contain a lot of trees that are necessarily significant they might be good or average some of them out there anymore so we 're really only looking to protect those trees which are properly significant that we 're not protecting trees on so we 're not listening trees on public land we predict only by another meters okay so while so how many trees are on public land and why would you have the planning control from private rather than like I guess public romping council government why would we have a different role for us again again there 's two reasons one is that we didn 't have time and the second reason is that we 're probably protecting more trees this way and because it covers every tree in a public realm with previously the running some 100 there were listed is significant tell going to ask you about the pruning part it 's this on page 52 especially winds overhead wires and there 's reference here that unless it 's detrimental to the health or structural integrity of the value of the tree and so does that mean that in fact sort of i 'm wondering at what point because sometimes we do have some trees which pretty miss shapen because they 're there to be proven because of the white wiring so does this cover that sufficiently because sometimes like quite frankly you 'd be replat my ladies you yeah so the there are outside the district plan provisions that allow electricity providers to to do that pruning anyway if it 's interrupting people supply just there will be instances where it 's difficult to prune a tree and have it retain its shape I think this is more about helping people who guide him following can go back and suggested they do it in a slap it slightly better way that 's less likely i thought the criticisms I thought page 52 was all about felling a tree is it felon you can 't fail unless the tree is deed or the trees with intolerant zones for overhead electrical conductors but if i read that wrong no you 're great I 'm sorry I haven 't read this for all I 've been looking at Gibbons for subdivision yeah so that this is in the public ground so these are council-owned trees yeah but so they can 't_''_1476.58 be felled unless they make these criteria so this isn 't about pruning Phil you 're allowed to prune to keep trees safe and keep the public safe I guess is about removal really yeah when when it 's and it 's not it isn 't be honest you musn 't yeah but if it 's within the tolerance science for overhead electrical inductors and continued pruning as detrimental detrimental to the ongoing health or structural integrity or landscape value of the tree so you have to be valid it has to meet certain criteria certain criteria to be met before and consent can be granted fulfilling the tree on that on those grounds it 's difficult because trees are important but so is electricity going would be your last auction yeah it 's a very low but it 's got to be provided for because in some instances it would be an absolute danger to actually leave it there and to require whoever to apply for resource consent to today presumably discounts will be applying to itself we going through that process it 's fair to say that some of the trees that are under under the the opium was now with hindsight you wouldn 't replan because I wouldn 't bet the most suitable behind silently and not as soon as they might have been well there 's another side to that story a while ago council committed to underground all overhead wires in Christ chips so the trees will need to grow through them on that understandeth and that undergrounding being got transferred to arterial collector lids and since the fundings been restricted that of background as to why we have trees that are growing through wives it 's interesting very good anything else with pruning list high school environment you _"

    "text": "that 's exactly where we 're up to so if we 'd like to just carry on and if there any additional questions that people here they can let us know did you finish going through them more years we have with Ivan would just like to wrap up we go spreading please wrap up thank you look it is we 've had a good discussion this morning so as a summary the development promotes urban consolidation there have been some significant site specific limitations but these are largely overcome we hear this morning that there may be some costs with providing some of the infrastructure but those costs and no more than what normally happen when do we develop in your areas and the planning leads infrastructure rather than the other way around so I don 't think there 's any concern there as a to be prudent we feel that a low in city housing is the least risk option because there are geotechnical things going on here and we feel that a low density residential is it has been done already in parts of the basin there cost point of view that the sticking points are that the I mean there are some steps a tree Metis to be considered and we 've had a letter this morning from Sarah about that know that this area is outside the other limits or the outside the priority area for servicing we know that so it 's inconsistent with the loop as it stands it 's not giving effect to the RPS as it stands that there are processes by which those methods can be resolved through various forums so that was really all I wanted to say just just to wrap that up all right yep what does the low-density just in terms of like how many houses period it would be about five we 're talking about 2,000 square meter sessions the same as Taunton green think we may get submissions to to go higher than that that would those submissions would have to be assessed on their merits with some very good GA technical information support could they get a variation that was a zero possibility they could intensify to the number ranked the current rules if there is going to if they I get to go below 2,000 square meters I think that would be a metal we sorted out at the independent games panel stage we caught us in the future of course depending on how they later I mean they 'd have to lay their initial subdivisions out very carefully but the way that the existing taunton green and one or two others rather be laid out and some some sites could be subdivided some car depends on whether put the dwelling Phil look I 'm sorry for us later and mr. part of us but I my question really this was really when we look at natural hazards that I know the staff are going to include the information like for example what we receive from the geographers at at can 't agree that overall unfortunately yes says he is thinking so and I 'm not expect you to come into their live in men press I 'll ask them this when it come to come with the young when it comes to the natural hazards part people like like Helen but account yes we have had this morning the geo technical advisor providing information on that whole geotechnical sphere but there is that the area there is a very gradual sinking there at the moment existing developments it hasn 't caused any concern to the landowners to date that I 'm aware of where you get a lot of filling that will put weight on the ground as well and there have been one or two issues with X happened we don 't anticipate a lot of filling in this particular subdivision but in any event where that where that has happened it has affected the gravity sewer system but not but we 're putting them we 're proposing pressure systems here therefore that issue won 't won 't_''_263.67 if a ground does gradually sink it 's not going to hear tok-yo fect houses people with lauren 's may what will leave it in the future that that hasn 't really been an issue that I 'm aware of in the last 20 years and with these developments that have already been underway perhaps I could just reiterate the the geotech which has only the high areas around the periphery of the basin not not the lower areas that obviously would be covered by flooding would it would relate to a TC to type standing and sara 's technical categories and the same thing is mostly related to Pete and this area a very deep level of P which is under lane again by scoria sand and rock so what she said was that that doesn 't make it that doesn 't rule it out for use for development it just means that the foundations of any buildings to go on there need to be done correctly and also as I as Ivan has pointed out you shouldn 't have too many buildings on an error because they 're all flattened it would that would be too heavy all right yeah well I mean just parts of Christ you it 's really a like that but yeah so the development have to be done very carefully I poor would probably make that point as well that you know if you get a lot of dewatering as an example that could a done quite carefully alright so that 's the cranford Basin chapter yes okay so moving on now to the specific purpose I in flatland recovery we have Kimberly roll tongue this is chapter 21 and your chapters so following the Canterbury earthquakes the residential red zone areas on the flesh were identified by government where people and property could be at risk from natural hazards anywhere it was considered that those risks couldn 't be reasonably mitigated well that 's actually not create so I made this point several times which is why we now go read zone because they didn 't zone and they didn 't say that it couldn 't be mitigated they said that it the costs of mitigation would be too great and the time involved would be too significant to allow for that to a cure and they didn 't decide a purchasing regime other than a voluntary one and it 's been the subject of a court case so i think the section 32 needs a little bit more work done on okay yeah yeah so just to let you know the areas that the land along the avon river and also south short you brighten and the brooklands area as well it will not include the near the port hills areas and so I guess this chapter is seeking to address the following issues yeah I just the uncertain future intended use of this land including options for long-term recovery as well as the fact that parts of the area are also subject to multiple natural hazards therefore year we consider there 's a need to protect the lens select long-term recovery and land use opportunities can be more really realized in the future the the land use recovery plan was specifically excluded from considering the residential red zone and it states that future use of land in the areas known as the residential red zone it will be addressed through the residential red zone program now it 's through this program Syria will undertake a public engagement process to determine future use options in addition to this council are also undertaking a process of identifying or infrastructure requirements may be needed in the area stormwater or flood management control and where this outcome of that program will then inform a later plane change to confirm the future zoning we 've had some brief discussions with series to the time frame of that process and yes there 's still at steer this tool that 's not known at this point I 'm so there 's a separate time frame and process with taking faces but in the interim period there 's a need to ensure their activities taking place in the area will not compromise or impede the long-term recovery of the zone or is this about the consequences of natural hazards so through this review we are proposing to defer final zoning of this land to enable this this work to take place the the program the consideration of what long-term outcomes to be sought in what the recovery needs of the zona so it 's a we 're proposing a holding zoning with provisions that enable elements of immediate recovery activity and the land management activities thats Sarah are undertaking with the on the land that they are noting that there 's still people that are living in parts of the lead to intensification or any subdivision or new development which may limit long-term recovery potential I guess and then as I touched on earlier given the type of activity or land management activity work that is taking place such as a lot of demolition work it 's important therefore that we address you know the effects adverse effects associate associated with those activities so really looking at yes sort of the shower surrounding environment and effects at the interface and on occupied residential units and we have Syria hairs head a has had the opportunity to have a look at their this chapter and the proposed approaching provisions and they 've yet have been quite comfortable with this approach yes yeah yes with this this hinder any sort of future development war project ideas that could take place in the recent sorry in the Flex lamb and recovery zone I think it would depend the timing that because at the moment these provisions are very much hold we don 't want to do anything too significant in here no no new development at this point in time however I guess the Sarah program is to is to identify what what the community wants to happen out there and they have a whole program that will deal with that but we don 't know the timing of when that 's going to actually come out and so our our purpose here is simply just to hold things as they are and if we wanted to do like any sort of mitigation like banking and so forth that will then two people with us you know there is a there is provision for hazard management work such as that they done by council stormwater that 's usually that 's not hesitant that 's to do with improving the quality of the storm water going into the river I mean one day we 'd actually quite like to have clean rivers yeah there 's provisions for obviously maintenance repair and use of existing infrastructure and the provisions of the utilities chapter will apply so with or not and that 's a suit on what they 're so have a sudden so if it 's so what does that mean like if we wanted of agreed we wouldn 't be able to do that under our own plan I 'm not certain what the utilities chapters provision is not utilities it 's a storm water for example you might have wetlands placed into the river the move removal of stock banks which is not the maintenance of existing flood protection works and bank erosion work I mean I just think that you may not have thought of things that should be permitted that wouldn 't be permitted and this in this time frame because it may well be that we will want to do some of that work ahead of the future use discussion yes this chapter has been discussed at some length with Sarah officials and also through the collaborative advisory group that includes members from various agencies including Sarah what I 'd like to do again has come back to you on Wednesday then to see if that has been discussed and considered as part of this chapter and what their response was to that okay there is a know yet okay you know that 's fine yep so I think that yes so now we have enjoyed cultural in a rather large chapter for you _"

    "text": "this is actually amendments and resolution so I just been a lot of time on at all and the majority in fact amendments that will be covered by the natural and cultural heritage chip that any way other than the very last one which is the deletion of a tree which was t 270 that again as it 's a resolution to be dealt with at a later meeting we won 't look at that today that 's me next Friday yep that 's the end of the presentation so that 's the end of central city nestled in the temple so thank you very much um so sorry yonni yeah and I had a crystal the trees so page 36 s 32 that 's really really sad reading I encourage everyone to read it we clearly have a crisis with our trees getting damaged by construction activity and utility installations and we I mean as local councillors for the central city in terms of higley firmament ward we are constantly getting removed tree notices because the trees are in poor health what I think is becoming apparent as the and and and other damage that 's been caused by contractors so creminis square possibly this not but it may be that it 's because of parking so I just think we need to really think I just really want to know that we 've got an increased level of consenting for some of these activities so that the trees aren 't being damaged understand if naturally there are in poor shape and you know that 's something we can 't control but page 36 and 37 just just makes you want to cry when you read how our trees are being destroyed unnecessarily great thank you for raising that so trees will be talking about in more detail next Friday is that correct uh well the natural and cultural heritage chapter chapter 9 will be dealing with on the agenda it says 1135 which obviously we 're running a bit late so will be later today and I think counselor Hansen 's question was a general one or you talking but there are those same matters that go across the city victim okay did you want a response to requirements we can put in place to ensure that contractors are not necessarily damaging trees so that we 're having to remove them so the central city chaptered and because of the way to centricity recovery plan works can 't protect street trees so there are difficulties for us and managing effects on those street trees we can protect individually listed trees on private property and treason how the pub public places like parks and reserves but not not so recently instructors and perhaps Shane can add to that yep imple probably would be good to separate what has been contract damage to what has been earthquake-related tree issues because my understanding in the city center a lot of the trees have been compromised by the earth effects of the earthquake we love snap roots of yeah so it would be good to understand if there is a problem with their contractors all that as opposed to the earthquake damage and the ongoing earthquake damage to those trees we 've got to get an understanding so you can put a bit of balance yeah it 's it 's very difficult what 's contract but contract contractor damage is quite evident because you can see torn back you can see ripped roots you can see broken branches whereas earthquake damage and until the tree moves in the ground we don 't know it 's there and it 's been four years since fevery most of the trees that we 're destabilized we will know we had a monitoring list which we monitored for two years we didn 't remove any of those trees and after two years they are considered to be of a structurally sound nature again because they put on sufficient root growth so in the central city or actually anywhere in the city we know what 's contractor damage but we don 't necessarily know whether or not these these earthquake damage sitting under the ground until it becomes evident all right thank you for this so that now concludes the central city so thank you very much indeed for that presentation we now move on to cranford basin and we are running slightly late this can go through till midday and we will need to stop at we 'll be back at one o 'clock prompt to continue from where we 've got two so when Ivan welcome to the table and cranford basin over to you okay so there 's an introduction I 've got Kimberly who 's been helping with this somewhere emily is Kimberly and also in the audience we have Samantha we 're from ghd who 's our geo tech advisor Bridget O 'Brien who 's a senior planning engineer for wastewater and water and I have Paul Dixon who 's our senior stormwater engineer from asset networks to do with drainage neither three key technical constraints which I will describe very quickly as we go through this presentation so what but what I 'm going to cover today or we 're going to cover is what has been proposed the reasons for supporting the proposal and the statutory implications and I 'll say right up from the area we 're talking about is not inside the urban limits or the infrastructure boundary and the RPS and it is not in the loop so it 's inconsistent with the loop at the moment RP year so we understand that and Sarah the organization next door has made that quite clear so the area we 're talking about is this one the most you will know it it is a an area which development has kind of circumscribed it is in policy terms you wouldn 't get a better part of the city proven consolidation but they 're obviously there are four constraints which have constrained its development in the past the first one has been access and cranford Street is a limited access road but that will be solved once the northern arterial designation extension or the extension of the designation has been sorted out so that is the designation you can see they 're up in the and the orange there the this the other constraint has been flooding and that is a storm water ponding area so we certainly don 't want develop it in there that the the council has designated quite a large area they 're shown and the solid green as a stormwater detention area not all the properties have been purchased at the moment that the hearings these storm water basin like on as we speak down at the YMCA so those two constraints are potentially being addressed and we could get some more technical information on that from Paul if we blow and if we need to the the third constraint has been wastewater the area is a much the known as the northern relief sewer catchment and that has been a long-term issue for the council the city because of the infiltration of ground water getting into the pipes during heavy rainfall when I think if crazy amount of them even more however we believe we 've got a solution around there which Bridget would explain to you if you want to hear details around there the fourth one is the one that 's probably most problematic the constraint Nets geotech so the soil is a largely Peter a mixture of peat and sand and the does put a limit on the types of development that can go in there and we 've got cement the web to describe that in more detail again if you want to hear more details so in summary it got these foresight constraints that we the advice that we have so far and the work we 've undertaken we believe that we can probably accommodate some development around the edge of the basin itself so that is the white hatched area on the screen or in your in your handout that is the area we are looking at for residential development I just at this stage we 've got two or three submissions seeking development and parts of those areas that we have to respond to as part of the stage three hearings on the replacement district plan so what has been proposed the the solution that officers are suggesting is that to enable very low density housing on most of the land not required by the two we know ours and what we met load against me is the living 1b zone which is currently in the plan and will be called residential suburban Pete constraint overlay in a replacement district plan now these sections are 2,000 square meter men are so the half acre sections there are areas around the basin that have been so developed in with photographs led in a minute they have those areas heads just sustained very little damage of any and the earthquakes because motor houses are all piled and the infrastructure has piled they 'll do understand that there has been some damage to the infrastructure but I through ground settling but I 'm not sure whether that Bridget because of the earthquakes or just grants it me right so that 's what we 're proposing low density some land will remain as rural urban Fred gentle further geotech information is obtained and the land being acquired for storm water retention remain as we 're all friends until such time as it can be resigned open space natural so just will be met showing you that zoning pattern shortly and there it is there so the you 'll see some of their area is in the floor level area it 's that 's not a consumer Christ juice is probably in that floor level area so it 's not a it 's not a serious constraint so the area there which is enclosed by the red dotted line and the sort we that 's been proposed for residential suburban peak constraint overlay zoning and as I said before quite a lot of it is subject to a submission from the landowners and in fact it 's been subject to submission on a number of occasions and they submitted on proposed change one to the RPS and they submitted these landowners submitted on the land use recovery plan so this is not a new issue and the reasons for not zoning it for reasons I gave before yes in the end yes then the uncertainty around the Vino ours and of course those decisions to have to come out so there 's a little bit of uncertainty until week on those exact boundaries and two other signals on in our eyes come out but I don 't think they 'll change really you know sorry notices requirement decision well the hearings are now so we 're imagine the decision would come out in two or three months hopefully so the decisions should come in within the the timeframes that before we go to the independent hearings panel hopefully thirdly so my immediate immediate concerns are around you know what would be the technical category of the land obviously susceptible to flooding is it also susceptible to liquefaction are we actually just repeating flock turn or bexley all over again and is this in fact for those reasons are wise decision and I mean you you 'll obviously have some technical capability to to back that up sand technical reports that would back that up and give reasons for your decisions and I 'm guessing we 'll be coming to that as you go through the years presentation that 's correct the well just do that they are very important questions but the land which we rezoning is quite high it 's as you can see most of its outside the floor level area some of its inside but just inside but it is quite high and it is a beyond the area of flooding so Paul can elaborate on that shortly if you like and give a bit of a more information on that yeah I mean flooding would be one part of it and then what we might think of as know that land typically which is subject to flooding in low-lying storm may easily also be subject to liquefaction and heightened earthquake respects lutely so I 'll get a Samantha to ask to address that question but the land the geotech reports so far as not susceptible to liquefaction it 's very aware but Samantha can atleast that question and sit in a minute and the light areas that you 've identified on the map they aligned with the areas that are subject to the submissions that you 've talked about generally I think a little bit more out that we put in a little bit more and to round it off but they there 's a small area outside outside the area that 's been submitted on yep great now generally they so yeah don 't forget what the percentages Kimberly I camera it 's actually just the little wheeze around circle a bit at them on the right-hand side there was the only view heart that is subject to submission never yep to their right and that 's subject to such a mission yet to submit is there that 's all submission as well and you further down and it 's just that one on the far right side over here yeah that 's already results already it was an actual deferred yes currently it sort of resigned Rees I 'm not reads owned it 's a residential deferred signing I think in the operative pain in the currently yeah okay so that 's a nut sure what we 're proposing there is an outline plan which will go into the plan as well so it 's a very basic outline plan that 's really just where the parks might go or where the internal road network might go we probably the key thing there is is we don 't run possibilities Dickstein grants road through the cranford street but they don 't that would not be I think that would be a sensible idea so it 's basically a staggered thing here ya see these grants road they just give you a bit of this grants road peppery roads down here is cranford street that 's Kiwi to drive no not well that was can I ask be um would it be an assumption that the storm water pond would actually help to drain that whole area anyway yes he will be the assumption any compensatory storage we put on that basin probably okay thanks and so there 's a very basic outline plan and just the these that these are one or two photographs of that this is taunting green so there 's quite like there 's this here perhaps hasn 't turned out as a the attractive street frontage that we 'd like it 's along grasmere street opposite Norris place but this is a sort of quite open low density housing that you tend to get in these areas so what it means is it reduces the weight on the Pete it basically it 's that the buildings will be piled and it 's probably the compromise of making efficient use of the land versus you know not doing anything with it at all so Samantha and in such a manner and Paul come up just sort of to give a little bit of a brief on the storm water and the geotech issues got a question from yonni yep one of the things that um is really important in Canterbury is versatile swords and I note that it 's really hard to see what the season we 've done around things like food security and the irreversible impact of developing on versatile swirls is there a soil assessment for this particular area there hasn 't we not recently it would have been done in the past but the and they have been classed as versatile horticultural versatility to but basically we have a report there that says that farming is just not economic and the landowners there have been struggling to make farming ago with its they get flooded out then they get flooded out they get noise complaints and the neighbors because of birds scaring or other things going on there they get vandalism so the cases have been there for a long time and they 've been they 've been seeking rezoning since too well at least 2002 because of the fact that you know it 's just such hard work and making the operation viable thing the flick I thought when that works finished we 're not going to have flooding to the extent I mean we 've been to the high corn we 've got grown ups and staff so if the flooding issues will work with folks because it seems that there 's been too much development up top and not enough stormwater capacity would you think that these sores would still be productive no not not only not an economic sense of fact we 've rees owned hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of versatile sewers around the edge of the city to residential with the under the current planning regime so it 's been pretty inconsistent that we decided this 50 hectares would be a protective of versatile saw it was given that what we 've what 's been resigned so far and I think the issue too is that the cranford Basin is we all know is surrounded and residential and the only reason it was left out of what was previously called the Metropolitan urban limits were the four environmental factor that Ivan has touched on they can they will be dealt with through the that high standing land and then with the fact that keeping 50 hectares which is subdivided up into several different owners and farming them becomes non viable this is why we 're bringing it to you now the intention to change the regional policy statement maps and the land use recovery plan the process for that would be counseled submission to the land use recovery plan yep so just this before i 'm samantha and paul deal with those two issues now the reasons that three reasons rural users are not viable so that really council johansson that 's your point really commercial and activity activity commercial industrial activities are appropriate because of whether it 's so close to a key activity center and the low density reflux some serious local constraints now in the normal scheme of things this area would be ya up for medium residential development because it 's pretty close to its quite closely casey at pepper newest so you 'd normally have your medium density around here but the the scenario testing we 've done means that it 's just not it would not work round off on brigitte 's point so the land is outside the priority area for infrastructure the density isn 't consistent with intensification and the cases have just said it does not meet the density requirements of new greenfield priority areas and there is need for integrated decision-making around the notices requirement the lit review and the decisions of the ihp so that there are some process issues to work through here that they 're not insurmountable and the idiot we are engaging with you Diaz partners as we go through this process so oh just wondering whether okay we 've got a question from yep just to clarify so there are infrastructure constraints to allow us to actually intensify so basically you see no there are there are there were constraints but they are they are being overcome and i 'll get i 'll get bridget to explain that through sewers the main one the drainage one we believe is the pool sailors I think it 's that 's largely dealt with the traffic is dealt with I think that the sewer is dealt with to allow at least that there are locally fix which are relatively minor of this density so they 've all been largely dealt with but I mean that 's why I 've got the staff here to answer those questions in more detail so maybe if we hear from Bridget that might address some of these concerns yes you 're right so basically the most of the area so that large chunk on the left hand side and I 'm going to do number it just bring back the map of what 's proposed proposed painting that please discharges into so that big block on the left sorry which one oh sorry he saw this block here and discharges into the northern relief so which has already constrains that discharges to have down the bottom end here so we 've already got major capacity constraints in it so and overflows at that point what 's known as the Grasmere of flow overflows into dudley creek so they 're already happens and basically once a year and any addition of extra wastewater will just make their worse we do have a project in the draft the northern relief so probably putting in some sort of storage facility at that point to stall the wastewater during storm events but that 's not due for completion until 2023 so we need to be quite so careful about how we manage this in the meantime what 's what we 're looking at is probably because of the ground conditions in the capacity constraints would probably look to make this pressure sore system area with every house having its own precious air pump pumping into network any new houses here yeah any existing houses will be either connected to the Celtic we 're all dealing with all inside I 'm not sure which so because it allows us much better control over the flows into the network and it 's a much tighter system so we 'd get a lot less in the way of inflow and infiltration coming into the network so that 's what we 're proposing for the large block the the smaller block here this one here a casing croazia sites would actually they discharge into different catchments as is the pump station six catchment there 's some pipe work capacity limitations and further downstream just upstream of pump station six and that we 'd need to upgrade as a result of this otherwise we 're going to have extra main holes overflowing in the street during a storm event so we 'd need to upgrade probably about give me a second we need to upgrade about 120 meters of pipe to accommodate the increase in flows so that 's what 's proposed from our wastewater perspective and the air is also a bit constrained from water supply and we need to construct a new water supply pump station to service the site as well and that would probably be somewhere around around here I haven 't done the cost year all we 've done is work out what the how we could serve us at the emc me aware that there be additional costs associated with us that we 're not for the walk so while the wastewater we have already got a plan project in place and it would just be a matter of increasing the size of that project to take into storage being this bigger it be slightly larger for example in terms of water supply I don 't think we 've got a planned project for a new pump station near by that would that would be we must have like we know must know how much it costs for a meter apart we do I just sorry I just have I mean I can come back to you on that if you want to know I 'm just kind of interested isn 't millions is it a few hundred thousand is it I think it 's more like a few hundred thousand bro better yet need to contain and the water would be obviously a lot more significant because you 're built yeah pumping station yes that 's a new new pump station and again I 'd need to come back with you with a ballpark figure if you wanted to know I think that 'd be really useful for myself Yeah Yeah Yeah right yeah if we can get that further information that would be nice if about both sides so separately cost of infrastructure that said the the right well we 've considered them as a whole and i think that the water supply pump station would serve the whole area and be part of the new st. Albans water supply zone so the way the weights been considered so far is just what would what would it take to service though the whole area except that the back feet into a different catchment focused let 's wait for wastewater oh yeah I can see it could be different a secret price for that pipeline upgrade this is great thank you now we 've got about five minutes before we get to twelve o 'clock and i 'm keen to be ramped up just a couple of minutes before 12 so that we 're ready for that and wave presentation so that just gives us a few more minutes now before we need to finish for lunch alenia appearing a submission to the loop on this we will be lovely here in hope is not be cheated to you ask Samantha about geotech I mean that it isn 't there are some geo cheek challenges we accept there I think the good opportunity to get information from these experts okay now is it worth starting that now or would we believe that until after lunch do you think given that we 've only got probably three or four minutes now to do that we might be better to let that be the first thing we do after lunch you submit the current come back after lunch so it 'd be beasting all right let 's go let 's go really quickly now but we literally do have only four minutes to complete this so yep great someone mentioned assistant expects Lee is this a problem what would be the TC zoning the site is generally underlain by up to four meters of peat and below that reasonably what would say moderately dense too dense sounds and grubbles so the liquefaction risk is is low we 'd probably be on a TC to type zoning the issue if the development of this area is not really a liquefaction prone issue it 's a it 's how do we do you technically work with the peat because Peters compressible that the issue for the in terms of the understanding foundation requirements and infrastructure development is related to Pete and the properties of repeat rather than liquefaction so properties with probably people would need to be piled and we 'd need to look at the industry how to make the infrastructure and any longer term consolidation of the peat can I just clarify those that there are areas like this all through the city are they not that have Pete oh yes so it 's not an unusual fake organs is an area that has Pete underlined by this has probably larger thicknesses of Pete than the other areas in fairness to it is this is a Pete true peat layer that we 're dealing with here as opposed to organic salts and Pete 's intubated but from a foundation and development point of view it 's there are technical solutions that overcome that ground pipe great thank you pulling really model that shows how long term no solutions are or are not how durable I mean yeah I mean if we have proposed to undertake to this and what the Pete to try and assess how much the Pete can consolidate that the issue is is really too so you 've got the Pete you have to go low the Pete because the peak behavior is unpredictable but no there are no long-term models there 's a fair to say that it 's actually not ideal blend for developing housing on you can always develop housing it requires okay we probably should wrap up at this point because we 've got the the wave people outside thank you very much so I will adjourn the meeting now and we 'll be back at one o 'clock to continue with the agenda you want to continue with us okay yep said we just continue where we 're leaving off now at one o 'clock thank you _"

    "text": "apparently there 's an issue because the first floor are having a big clear out and they 've stolen bins from other areas we we 're currently trying to find a spare bin so there 'll be an update later in the day on the bin situation all right Bridget I 'll just hand over to you and will continue on just two amendments to the general rules and procedures well as just technical thing make numbers weren 't included in the appendix and so the first image just to add those numbers in and the second one is to show the full extent of the stone his site as a shield activity so the next slides which I won 't bother stopping on was just the maps edit on the right hand side mate numbers and it 's the net with the red outline in the middle right hand side showing the proper extent of stone host moving on to the natural hazards so there 's been an increase in the area covered by the full level m.phil management area to was previously the flood management areas and second discretionary activities now include liquefaction susceptibility so we 're an activity is a discretionary activity then one of the assessment manners will be the perfection susceptibility oops that 's right heza substances and contaminated land the amendments their hair being centrally to bring our standards in line with his know and the land and water recovery plan and there are new Peterson policies which arrays the issues of review sensitivity and how that relates to natural hazards and hazardous facilities sorry Andrew can I just ask how they and interrelate so do these I do does your increased flooding vulnerability and all those other things Nair appear on your limb or how do people find out that they are that the property that they 're buying where is going to be is affected by day by the has known the sorry the natural hazards or any of those things all right you stir all on the penny maps on the plenty maps are they on your limb let 's still to be determined but it 's highly likely that certainly the natural hazards will be and hazardous contaminated land and solar cell sites will either on the again on the inside yeah okay yeah sorry I 'm so like I 'm just increasing concerned at the number of asbestos sites that are only now being kind of identified so in terms of contaminated land have we got any kind of process to check because a lot of them don 't actually need demolition consents so I don 't know how they would get recorded as being on a hail site or having sort of bad stuff so I 'm just hearing a number of places in the central city like the audience the one that is most recent the head of estas there for quite a while um it 's only now being identified right I understand um because it was discussed before with when Mark Rushworth was still here at that time and he said that there was a different process for that and it was um II can was also involved it 's a different method but not with a district plan am I understand for registered plan is that we provide the requirements for consents so I the central city and there 's a very good chance that it 's got specials that you should have a consent so that we can be notified and know what the what the work involved is around those contaminants or those hazardous materials can I can wait to please on that council because my understanding it is through the Regional Council but I just like to clarify that before I give you a responder building act that I think they mentioned will come back to you whether fulsome response on that peps next Wednesday yeah I think would be really good and the other thing that I 'd really like to know is what requirements we have for people to do tests when they take on the lend you so probably the Metro sports is a really good one again that Len was left in its state for a long time and then when we went to put a car parking someone found out it had a Swiss dose so so I just don 't quite understand the timing from when something 's lived to when it gets a use contaminated well I 'll get back to you on that yeah we can get some information back on wedding slay that 'll be fantastic thank you so moving on the natural and cultural heritage the Sullivan changes here aven river has been identified as a site of ecological significance and significant landscape feature it was a outstanding natural landscape where is our nature landscape in the operative plane there are some rules about clearance of indigenous vegetation in specific circumstances unlikely to have a significant impact on most of the city there 's a new policy in terms of working with my tahu to identify and assess sites of cultural significance a change in terms of heritage items heritage items and settings and that whereas we previously had four different groups for such items it 's now been reduced to to the listings include five new items the rules that apply to else with the rules apply now to items and settings and previously there weren 't that many settings yep and i will get a man to OCR heritage advisor to come and speak to them that 's okay 65 Cambridge here this offers in pledge as you by the river there 's a house at 23 to 25 casual street yes between it 's right by on the pop yep yep the new city hotel the new cid litter bugs after day there that 's a heritage see it listed by heritage New Zealand so we write so you were quite okay yep look at it end up mute the three shop the coca gallery it 's across the street and a small office building in Montreal straight 181 Montreal which is Williamson 's construction company building it 's sort of across the road from South City Montreal street Montreal is endurocross the road from surf city as you go and you 're under on the street oh sorry but it 's been okay and and the class 1 and 2 as opposed to four classes what does that I appreciate that there 's significantly fewer heritage buildings but what does that mean effectively a class 1 and 2 as opposed to four classes I might pick that up from a planning perspective and then Amanda from the classification moving from the you 've got water too yes yes so previously the four group classification was based around levels of significance ranging from national international and based on a geographical level and so the technical assessment has informed ranking on a high significance in significance level and so all of those items have met three sholde for listing very significant to be listed in the plan Amanda could take more questions on that but in terms of the rules what that means is they 're all significant Philistine the rules are identical for group 1 and group 2 but the level of significance does come into play in the matters of discretion so when they activity as its east against those matters of discretion regard but could be given to whether it 's a group one or group to classification now there is an your package of information and you 'll come across is for chapter 9 an individual statement of significance for each and every heritage item so that will set out white significant yeah would you want to build on it I mean to UM it of what 's listed and what 's not and what 's really important because with four it was too finely grained it was very difficult when you 're writing an assessment to decide we draw that line and initially we looked at having one brick because everything 's significant to the city that meets the threshold but we actually found no really there are items which are of higher significance particular importance to the sense of place for the community they have high income pretty good very original and tech and and if we defined what 's one in two or his heritage museum to find it we we 've defined that is this approach a methodology pride could I just point out that we have a whole hour and a half to go over chapter nine cultural natural heritage what we 're doing at here is just looking at the amendments look just looking at what relates to the central city regards natural and cultural heritage so you will have a lot of opportunity to ask a lot more background questions in that chapter and the afternoon great thank this notice asked person yani good no thank you um just in terms of the assessment that you 've done for the central silly have you have you looked at buildings that weren 't previously looks like you 've got some that are up here that you 're saying should be busted but here I just want to understand the methodology that we throw to look at the existing buildings posted quake and determine their heritage significance so we applied the same methodology across Central City as the rest of the city we had a full amount of research on every building site visits photographic records post-earthquake and we ran those through our new methodology for assessments which is six criteria and a number of thresholds the listing so basically what I 'm interested in as other any buildings in the central city that you haven 't had a chance to look at that could possibly be suggested as being worthy of a lasting because we 've lost so much in the earthquake so now maybe buildings of a certain here I become more important because we 've lost or 's due to our time frames we haven 't been able to do a full and comprehensive study of all the buildings in the central city to assist them in research them so that will be ongoing that will be opportunity for a plan change post April 2016 to add more if the if the council agrees to that so that so one building that has an emission which I think should be protected and this came through and the resource consent that was granted to build the 22-metre apartment in right next door was the art gallery so have you thought about listing the art gallery because it has no protection and there 's no rules or realm of convenience is this relevant question or or not um is it included individual buildings of courses I mean I guess it 's a question around the way that buildings were identified to do treated in this way and whether the gallery meets that treatment and if not why not the gallery is not included at the moment and as I said just moments ago we will go through the methodology for the rest of the city and a chapter nine cultural heritage there 's nothing to say we can 't add that gallery if for some reason it hasn 't been assessed or assist fully or or is considered otherwise post April 16 it is too late for us to include new buildings unless now this has been I 've raised the accurate just about every briefing we 've had on heritage for the last five years so I just cannot understand why it 's too late to to consider being listed like we should be making that decision I didn 't say it hasn 't been considered it hasn 't actually been researched you yeah right so you know I can 't_''_920.85 do that yes q I understand we can 't_''_925.33 do that now within the time frame that we have because these these particular chapters are coming to you for approval to go to the ministers in order to be notified within the time frames that we have it takes time to do an assessment also maybe what we need is an ability to say here 's the research done so we can include it because I mean I 'm just not happy that we seem to have no ability as elected councillors to have things considered that get get protection from a heritage so what we 're hearing from staff is that that can 't_''_959.529 be done within the time frame obviously the point that yannis making is that he 's very keen to have the art gallery put in there is there a way that we could do what yannis suggesting if we wanted to what we can try and do is look at having an assessment done so that it possibly could be incorporated within a council submission if the assessment comes out that it should be protected and or that it be tabled through evidence when this chapter is heard what I 'm saying as though the assessment can 't_''_990.01 be done in time for this chapter to go to the ministers and we wouldn 't want to be holding back the chapter in order to do that something in terms of the fastest that we can do what ya knees asking for the do that I would say the fastest way to do it was to initiate an assessment now and and and if it comes out as positive that it should be protected that 's another issue then there 's this committee can submit it as part of a council submission on on the stage when it 's notified great so if we can have that work done as a result of this that request that will be great thank you what the Cathedral are we stealing the protections for the cathedral and light of its security significance and well from the planning provision side of things the there has been a range of making some things more enabling in some things more owners where measures in terms of things been having significant adverse effects or effects that it or reversible versus medes which is regular ongoing and makes a for instance was the all of the Heritage items the activity status for demolition is non-complying for heritage upgrade works which would be seismic strengthening its controlled and there 's a range of repairs maintenance work which would be permitted with standards so deeming from a technical assessment in terms of how that 's come out a registration I think it came out as high significance so it 's a group one great thank you alright keen to move this on if we can okay well the next two bullet points that I 've the next slide Caroline 's just mentioned about the non-compliant sales for demolition and control activity status for upgrades so there 's the existing requirement for a resource consent for sites are joining the heritage item has been removed from the provisions Heritage listing for the form of beasts for Barnet 's and the extent of that has been increased so it 's not just the facade but the whole building and in terms of trees the trees trees are predicted either in a specific list specifically identified and a lost if they 're on private land if it 's on public land then protected through general provisions packed on the development of the casual retail development though the the beats are the bandits I just in terms at a location just to confirm that set the formal but it 's also radically mended inside because we backed around with it to put a school in it it 's got all sorts of things in it and but but there 's a major retail development going ahead there does this in any way create an impediment for that major retail development it would mean understand it would mean resource consent would be required for alterations are there in your area whereas previously it was only parts of the exterior currently putz the exterior it 's just the exterior at the moment parts of the extinct just part absolutely experienced but you 're saying now if you list the whole building you need resource consent to alter any of their internals none of which are historic by the way there is so interior heritage remaining some of its copied to some of that 's not real so a careful assessment because there has been so much change and so we did take that into account but it 's still so have you spoken to the owner of that development to ensure that this does not get in the way but more than that there is a shoot timeframe on him completing yeah some sorry activity and this resource consent could actually yeah under that time frame being met you 'll recall that early in the year we decided we needed to take with at the invite of the panel to take three months out of the program which meant there has been no public consultation with people on these matters so they will find out about it I mean obviously it 's available online now publicly it 's going to the ministers at the time that it 's notified there will be letter sent to directly affected parties of which obviously this building owner will be one of these types of rules and I think this potentially that one just scenes out red light signals to me and just in relation to two possible contingencies one which has to do with the council not your division and mine which has to do with this completion of that development and I 'm wondering if we could maybe I don 't want to approve that without knowing the impact of it back next Wednesday to do approvals so we can go away and and have a further look at that and I 'll just um the bank on Wednesday yeah and if we can get some more detail on that I think that would be good I mean I certainly share some of Vickie 's concerns we wouldn 't want our planning rules to be holding up a development that 's already well known to be to be planned within a relatively short time in Central City but at the same time if we are able to have planning provisions that protect the hair is a remaining heritage fabric of that building I think that 's something that a lot of points as well so yeah more information I think would be good so that we can make a confident decision on that one thank you two things one is just help me understand the remote requirement for a Razors can seen on sites adjoining a heritage item and so whether there 's been any consideration to group character area protection like high street for example recognition of special character zones first question which was the consideration around it rolfa adjoining heritage site and so the consideration was given to there so through the through the central city recovery plan a role was introduced to the development on the site joining heritage building to go through a resource consent process in terms of its relationship to a heritage building and that was in that recovery context and looking at what the scale of development coming through would be looking at that role in the context of the statement of expectations and needing to reduce consent in requirements and also looking at the appropriateness of retaining the role the assessment has been that it 's no longer considered necessary or appropriate to retain especially in light of the statement of expectations but there is something to know is that there are settings for heritage items so they are predominately within the land parcel so there is still an element of control around a specific heritage building but it 's more likely to be the controllers around their individual land parcel don 't need to concede how does that get picked up so through the heritage rules and in terms of whether it 's picked up through any other rules I don 't have the information to him that would be something that potentially is a residential or commercial there were any design controlled track rules but I understand that 's been reviewed through previous decisions when I want to remove on wednesday but and in the character areas like the high street can we give it a special prediction and so in terms of character areas it 's something that the I understand for outside the central city anyway that 's been looked at through the residential chapter what we are proposing through chapter routine and for chapter 9 as a proposed policy to do future work to look at Heritage Areas know that that would be based around predominantly of section 6 RMA measure as historic heritage as a matter of importance so differing to character area so there is quite a sort of sliding scale and some connection between those two matters but this chapters looking at from that very strong historic heritage angle so that really I think would your future heritage area type type work so in the context of yannis signaled amendment for wednesday if we can get information back on how that joining sites issue might be dealt with by other provisions again it means that we 've got all the relevant information around that before we make a decision on it so that would be good thank you okay so moving on to the _"

    "text": "the dead center of town pretty minor change right just just allowing maintenance work in repair work as a permit of activity seems entirely appropriate yep in poverty time so this is the bit of the residual red zone that 's within the central city it 's a holding zone allows repair and maintenance but it doesn 't allow new subdivision and intensification and development activities during the interim and as the second point infamous fear there will be a a plan change in the future as part of the residential red zone program to decide the ultimate fate for that area of land yep there 's I 'm just going to mention the amendments but okay no you do that yep so there 's just an amendment to bring the sims to the high hazard overlay provisions in line with those that you 'll hear about in terms of the hazard natural hazards later yeah so that 's all for that zone so there was a question um just in terms of that that red zone so you 're calling it a flat land recovery sign here we agreed we weren 't going to use the language of residential red zone because there is an appropriately creating an impression that it has been zoned and it hasn 't been signed that 's fine so so basically if you say you didn 't accept the government 's return offer and you wanted to rebuild or repair your house you can still do that for the central city it 's my understanding that there are no Sarah owns all properties within the central city residential read signs for there are no individual landowners remaining but yeah I will have a presentation to give you later on and in terms of the risk of the city flatline recovery zone so I can defer that Christian tool in or I 'm heading to say Sarah wanted to build housing there that 's basically if there 's no new no new buildings would be allowed and the only provisions would be sort of maintenance alterations or extensions of existing residential buildings why would you allow that well I guess if these people living there they yep bids deal with Dex let me get to still there yeah yeah so all of the property that would be residential red zone for flat land recovery zone and the CBD the area that we 're looking at here the central city that is now owned by Sarah yes okay and just as any control for the people that are adjacent to that area is it any sort of buffer yes so one of the keys policy direction is that I guess given the the type of land management activities that Sarah would be undertaking is different to what a normal residents residential situation would be like it 's sort of demolition activity just making sure that the early effects at the interface with sensitive areas such as yet the residential zone or open space that you that those if any effects would like such as noise would have to be considered through a consenting process they have to be notified it 's there a notification provision firme I don 't think there 's an exemption to date so that would go through the normal didn 't you deciding whether or not somebody is adversely affected all right larger what 's in the ccrp the provision the one slight differences in terms of Ireland who is possible which is unbelie-- evony which being a really small scale hospital is simply provided for within the provisions that allow non residential uses along b li avenue but the other larger hospitals have a specific hospital zone they 're being provisions largely amended to allow identification of those Hospital sites but some amendments and terms of provisions relating to sip X particular proms into the areas so there 's for example increases and high limits but as mentioned in some cases increased it begs the one amendment to this is to allow the former women 's hospital site to be used for the same promoted activities that are permitted in the central city or residential zone so PD seemed it right yep and Phil so you look current cost your children 's house of you including their that and the enclosure hospital see yes okay sorry it 's just made a distinction that 's all yep but I think it does highlight the usher around Corrections facilities I mean the way for a present when we design Scott sorry will bring tomorrow he may not being and today because the hearings finished yesterday and if that 's the case i 'll bring him back next week occasionally state number is not 24 is today doesn 't say um yeah knee I 'm resign it back to residential yeah can you go back and for the woman 's site you 're also saying that that would be have an underlying zone of residential that 's right same as with the general hospital when we were at the other day so but if someone wanted to build a big hospital there or I just worried with that last sentence you 've got activity specific standards shown as know that that 's just as we had with the other hospitals sites it was basically in a mission where we have an underlying zone we need to say that if they want to use the hospital zone for residential which is the underlying zone then they just need to comply with standards in the resident so it 's kind of a belts and braces right thank you inside a woman 's side the woman 's side they can do that now yeah they do that now not that they would have certain requirements wouldn 't exist is district plan yeah so have we liberalized those requirements yeah we spent a lot of time looking at what they could build on that site going forward and we 've gone up a bit in the haight away from the edges a lot of it reflects we 've looked at what they can do under the central city residential around it so we 've looked at the you know the height around it the setbacks around it and we 've adjusted hours so the new standards slightly bigger set backs away from the residential we 've thought about not having parking next to the housing you know 24 hour access so those standards reflect the context where is so worst-case scenario what 's like what could go there would be something that would address the existing neighborhood and when beats sort of like seen as a thing out of context compared to what was there previously I think the interface with the residential got lower heights yeah I think it 's improved good excellent thanks one madam chair I apologize but Scott is awaited a sick so God well it must have been a good day of the earrings but it all finished yesterday so and I apologize for interrupting here but perhaps next winter we still have a we have a dpr meeting next wednesday eight till nine i could bring him back in that slot ok better be great thank you so Trey slow yep transports pretty minor just a slight date change in four women typically car parks can extender to rather than the 18th of april 's in our thirties of april 2018 that 's just to be consistent with what 's already been approved in terms of temporary equate recovery activities in the second bullet point is just a change of status from for non-compliance with minimum car parking dimensions from multiplying to restricted discretionary hey otherwise it 's as per the operative plan so on a development say like well street we were looking to put in some cashiering k-pax what actually not sure which part of the zone it 's a sneer the polity yep and so it talk 2018 the deflector clearly in tap back from me but no these are these are actually provision for and it would be applicable in their East frame as well so if large blocks of apartments want to literally have a cashiering scheme as per what they have in auckland so you lease a car effectively so the car is parked there you don 't own it you just use it as and when you need to if its associated with the residuals of anything it 's that permitted activity is permitted but effort as a standalone car park and they 're offering it for Pete other than the people that live in the apartments then it is considered a commercial car park and it would either need a certain of discretionary content until 2018 there 's a temper activity or if it 's early perimeter needs as discretionary concede what good utilities utilities these provisions to enable them some panels and wind turbines and then amendments to so they will be exemptions and things like that just the same way as we do four chimneys and so anybody been already missing you really can 't put solar panels on no problem they don 't need to come and get special consent well then yeah with our existing replying come on indras comment you can probably tell you exactly what those exemptions are I might just mention just we want the amendments we 're waiting for andrew which is just to remove provisions relating to a liquid fuel in gas from this section because it 's actually really been dealt with and the hizouse substances exceptions hazel and so given that you can now put solar panels on a on a house at no capital cost whatsoever in christchurch i 'm assuming we 're trying to make this as easy as possible for people to do yes I think Andrew after the Christian series your weight room but just on another likely development given this is probably a 10 year plan and the development of driverless vehicles that will accelerate quite markedly next year when Tesla does it for its existing cars and over the next 10 years the likely very likely and that we will have driverless vehicles that hasn 't been considered at this stage I 'm sorry I 'm not sure that that would be a matter that we would that we could through the resource management extra disra plane and control other than the exceed that we allow service stations which could obviously here play on facilities at the service stations I would imagine matters relating to what happens on the road in matters that aren 't covered by the district plan and the resource management so for example and there will be within the next ten years very very highly likely driverless vehicles and many of them will be electric and they will range in size obviously and the driver doesn 't need to be there and they don 't you don 't need to own the vehicle either so how are we thinking about the city in relation to those issues it is what this is your video in terms of how they operate on the transport network that 's outside the district plan in terms of the council 's flavors example we 've got three fully electric vehicles at the moment that are that are all powered by electricity so we have been able to do that rich foot here make our part to fit that in so I 'm thinking about sorry but but I know I know we don 't think this is going to happen but it 's going to happen faster than we think and so we will have everything from very small one person cars through two persons through to one set and probably won 't be electric the big ones but you won 't need necessarily to own your vehicle but there will be vehicles available if you need them have we thought about how the city might accommodate that quite dramatic change in vehicle use I mean it 's not about whether they 've got drivers and them or not because there isn 't a joke if you if you have to drive the vehicle you have to park it somewhere and you tend to have to own the vehicle as well so that we look at a car that 's been done suggests their days of July next year when Tesla put driverless capability into all their cars and suddenly there 's 50,000 of them on the roads not ours but their price will drop such that that that there will be on ours how we actually deal with that that a driverless vehicle can take you somewhere but you don 't need to own that vehicle but ownership or not the plan deals with parking matters it deals with the size of turning circles or as parking areas everything related to cars whether they are driverless or not there are standards for in the plan whether the number increases again that 's an issue to do with road size and and where the roads go and and and what have you and that 's not dealt with under the resource management it I 'm not sure what it is that if there are complete changes needed to the plan that can be done through a plan change but at this stage the plan hasn 't it everything that relates to cars and vehicles at the moment I should be think I just wondered if you 'd thought about how radically this will change in the team in the next team yeah well we have been having discussions with with some of the literature providers recent months and done don 't worry yeah we really I think about but what I 'm hearing is that the plan is enabling and that regards yeah like a pool and growth under consideration just going that it couldn 't do and this may be something you need to think about we have taxi stands which are they for the purpose of clicking people so maybe it 's something if you don 't drive those cars anyone can hop into maybe it 's a like a tech c-type stand yeah yeah and the closer they all my cluster so I mean uber for example coming here next month and that will alter probably reasonably quickly the style of transport modes that we choose yeah ah SPECT Pauline the actually yep I 'm on utilities and just forgive me if it 's the wrong place wrong time but do we hear provision for 'm hearing from cafe owners not when we did do this I don 't know what what we came of it but a lot of cafe owners cannot recycle their food because there 's no excess to the bins or near for the bins or it 's down alleyways to eat suppose that was in the young city so every addressed it so I think it 's really important was all this food is just getting thrown out try to pick up through the intellectual rules just to see what is provided for two things as a having provision for these bins be having access from the main road to get these buns put into the tracks what sorry we 're just waiting to bring that back this is a rule to do with the commercial part of the chapters so he just trying to look up the rocks useful come back on I can we 'll come back to it yani yeah i mean i know we raised to some previous stage but i 'm just really mindful that in the central city the competition for space is really important but it seems to me when we when we try to make it more pedestrian friendly or cycle friendly the placement of facilities is actually utilities is actually really critical to get to get right so again i use the example on gloucester street fitzgerald where the kids are going to school crossing a busy road and there 's about that much footpath and his utility boxes three utility thing tone that on that corner that that just meant it 's a really horrible place but even 12 to use so here we thought about having some specific standards for utilities in terms of location and light of the accessible fence will play and the kind of you know increased focus on usability of this interim city and I know you 're going to tell me there 's a National Environment standard and we don 't have any control i I just I think we there must be a way in which we can put some sort of assessment medicine here no we did I did seem to a memo a couple months ago after last time and sitting cuz it 's our road footpath here when you go shared around the location of those cabinets that 's really our only Avenue so to speak for addressing that issue okay we 've got a really big agenda ahead of us and we 're due to break for morning tea at ten-thirty we 'd expected to be finished the Central City chapter and we 've still got a long way to go it was there anything in that Nemo that doesn 't cover what you want to raise now I mean I don 't want to just accept that we have to accept the status quo so I want to find a way to actually address is going forward but you just said that it was covered by natural environmental our national environment was tender well that is to a degree but maybe within what we need to do is be asking for some changes and in the context of what we doing I can 't_''_1234.6 see the scenes in rebuilding the central city and allowing utilities unfettered access to go wherever they like like it 's just bizarre if we just have to do it through the any years it seems that we 're just going to end up in a really bad situation yeah in terms of where they go there are rules that require where storage service areas shall be oh sorry this is a response to the brain burns question this is a risk profitez question that Nita was just replying to and we 'll get back to your question yeah photo meeting on how can we approve it so in response to your question so that 's to the rear of the principal building on the site so that 's where they have to go for the that 's the secret city and business own that 's based on the Green Mountains so those green bins we need to go oxen to pick them up see that was always another issue in terms of access is it there 's a point to which rules extent to work how far rules go because if waste storage areas are to the rear then inevitably there 's a need for access for practical reasons to get to the forward to prescribe that access has to be achieved to that outdoor storage area because some there 's a there 's a level to which prescriptions are necessary in my view but what I 'm discussion on that and they bring the buns out to the road where there is access for them to be emptied long as they can keep me of you is I know in the past they couldn 't do as know yeah that 's what right okay so next yep so general rules again very similar to so these are the things like you 'll get a taste but as we go through it in this case the pistol point is about temporary construction buildings and the change there is that we removed size limits outside the simplicity there is a maximum size of builders hats and things like that that you can have a second relates to sale of alcohol and those provisions have now been brought in line with the local Apple policy and the ccrp and noise entertainment provisions there is a new provision which requires that we annoy standards exceeded by noise standards now included relating to temporary activities into ventilation systems and ordinary standards so this is there 's a existing provision that requires a certain reduction in noise and alternative provision has been introduced which actually allows people to achieve a specific standard within the room for example with them the beer during which may not actually require that level of noise reduction because of the situation that building is in if it 's in the back of a building for example there may not be much traffic noise so it 's just an alternative mechanism for achieving suitable knowing environment inside buildings it 's been introduced yep it 's one so change pretty my thing low of the interest considering the only question the noise category two boundary has been moved to the centre of Oxford terrace rather than just applying on the private property so that the noise standards that apply to outdoor dining for example associated with those premises are exactly the same there 's being in terms of science is simple find calculation for the area of signs as a total maximum area of science there 's no longer controls on that number of signs or maximum the area of individual signs it 's all dealt with as a maximum there 's also an additional provision for three-dimensional littering on a building for building nor a business identification signs otherwise no other significant changes in terms of the other general rules relating to outdoor lighting and glare scheduled activities or is it Beck 's aircraft protection public safety emergency services provisions Yanni so you basically under the second bullet point number plus the number of signs of maximum Erika individual sign no longer control so we may have more permissive people have bigger size I don 't know the change as I understand it is that instead of saying okay you can only have every individual sign can only be so big and you 're allowed this number of signs what it 's now saying is there 's actually a maximum for your building and it 's based on your building and you can determine how you achieve that maximum in terms of one big sign lots of little signs towards the entertainer 's ratio how much signage you can have ivans in a bit of place to mention it well whatever the operative plans is because we have actually changed it but the actual details I 'd have to look at the provisions in more detail that that the main principle around this is trying to improve the design so what we 've what the provisions the new provision there are importance here is that the the signs are related to the building so we 're trying to prevent the signs protruding it protruding above the height of the parapet and we 're trying to prevent signs from covering architectural features and windows though they 're that they 're the new design controls the dimensions in terms of area I mean I haven 't_''_1691.539 that they 're in the air but I just haven 't had time to memorize them but they 're the same as the operative plan except so what we what the plan is trying to do in Arrow 's improve the relationship with a song in the central city between the signs and the building so we don 't get signs cover in Windows or other architectural features that 's the key change to the central city signage provisions in terms of the free stent or not fries yeah freestanding billboards are we reducing the not really on the size but I just you know the big drop the air that goes on the side of it building yes that 's not does that relate to that count as part of that building or is that it gets a separate consent for a secret sign that will probably need it a world where Shepherd sigh and the free billboards are separate from signs on buildings okay so do we just billboards through this yes and are we doing anything more restrictive no I wouldn 't think they 're more restrictive other than what I 've what actually outlined if you 're putting a billboard close to a building then there will be assessment matters which look at the relationship between that building in there in the Billboard again I just signal that you know I think we need to be really worried about the overt commercialization of space within the you go over the bridges and them more house or colombo more house you see these big signs that block views of the port hills block existing businesses and i just can 't see why we would be more permissive i think we 've actually had far too many of them be put up and the consenting process doesn 't seem to stop them from either going up and fit what we 're finding is a lot of makes you don 't even have consents but i think i just think we need to think of it more carefully about how we assess whether they they should be allowed that create some if they comply to the area and the number then they won 't they won 't need a consent but where they do those sorts of matters are taking into account so we 're all aware of the those particular examples that counselor Henson mentioned and they are part of the assessment matters which if they needed the trigger would consent they were take into account solely around the central city the key areas really able precinct and sense of the public open space and that 's we 've got comments from the minister an initial feedback on that particular issue because the the initial proposal that went as a draft to Sarah concerning for example flashing and illuminating signs we thought we 'd try to make them more permissive to make bright another central city at night the feedback we got there 's no that there should still be a restricted the switching activity as they are at the moment and particularly around and with particular reference to the avon river precinct which is another siege to the public open spaces light and energy and then in the night and like you know that there were varied more rules they were very nervous about flashing lights and whether or not the city should be a las vegas or not though you 're flashing lights i can get less you about but at plus apply shang and they 're surely that 's all right there 's an illuminated signs i think what we illuminated signs are fine but flashing lights I can kind of get that can be nights so what ya know it is surprising that 's not more rules counselor that existed i think is a state squad the city plans about but anyway difficult or more restrictive for us to do uplighting this is around science I 'm really serious dating that 's nice I 'll writing night until it 's signs no I know but if it was the issue of lighting was there as well so are we is there anything that makes it harder for us to do uplighting lights that change color this is about signs well and the general rules also includes that relating and glare rules and there 's nothing that 's been changed from what 's in the upper lip line in terms of restricting uploading a monument lighting or interesting things that change color those are the entries fountains all sorts not this botanicals and there 's nothing under the outdoor lighting and glare rules that would restrict upward lighting it 's only if it 's directed at a building or constructed at the road and has a potential to attract drivers okay it 's 22 it we right now so I need somebody we 're going to break from for morning tea and we 'll come back at eleven o 'clock but I need somebody to take over the chair of the meeting so would somebody like to self nominate so that we can pass a resolution who would like to cheer the note he 's going to be away being Eddington at twelve o 'clock so she 's going to have to leave by eleven thirty so no no but we 're going to adjourn the meeting at twelve o 'clock and I 'll come back for their and will be adjourned till one o 'clock so we 'll come back at one and look out on that so i 'll be back at one yeah i 'll be back at 12 so well i nominate andrew turner to chair the meeting and my absence when we come back from morning tea do I have a seconder for that proposition Vicki back i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so we standard you into then we 'll adjourn the meeting at twelve o 'clock til one o 'clock right _"

    "text": "so there are just a couple of minor amendments to the simplicity commercial zones one is somewhere in the electoral process some numbers became zeros in some of the sections so there will be a resolution to change that and also the section 32 indicates that in the central city mixed youself frame zone that there 's been a change in status for ya based activities in fact that 's not correct they remain non-complying in both the in the proposed plan s is the case with the operative plan okay ads mostly and the CIA stick to the DS yeah which is um gonna sell frame that 's k ads uh yeah based yeah well I mean the ones that are there now basically car sales ad Sunday yeah based includes car sales yards government censors the like garden center sensor frame oh well sorry i 'm just using it as an example of your best supplier as opposed to what 's in the cell frame but the non-complying existing users will be car sales you ads they have existing you sir eyes to answer there but they so some modifications they become non-complying non-complying if they 're going to be on existing insurance right can I just be really clear but central city kid so there 's a number of zones within the central city yes and the middle one is called the city o city businesses on and then they 're surrounding one is central city mixtures and then there 's another one is there another one there 's a there 's a central city commercial local zone which is the so on Barbados Street you 've got the small parade of shops at two intersections that 's an example of local zone and then the residential Center City received and then another suite of zones colleagues are leading okay i can i 'll try and find the there 's a map of the citrusy zones which i 'll bring over shortly and show you it 's actually quite complicated because there 's I need the zones there 's also some precincts within the zone so there 's actually a series of make that you have to look at to get the overall picture such as the a little cages getting it no it 's not you gave it its if we got the natural hazard once for a reason project oh no the natural hazards ones are to go with next Friday 's no that 's right I would have all received your stage 3 planning mix and your boxes just like what I JP they 're not the right one but the simple city maps are right at the very front just after the legend what which particular see the next sorry the presumably they 're not the natural hazard met no no so this one which you 've got in your hand and slow back so the first pitch weapon side will be the ligand which will be like this yeah yes it 's a council stage 3 so as I said there 's actually a number or net because there 's so many things that relate to the central city that need to be shown visually the first ones actor furnitures and grinder and building separate requirements yep then there 's a height one which is nice thanks I 'm nice natural hairy page and you 've got a legion that 's the next page so so the one we want is heated and it 's about hey what 's up the sixth man that 's titled Drive central city core frame large-format return what page this is the sixth map one two three four a big by round shape in the middle of it around six square drive central city core frame larger or Matt retail on health innovation retail on South brain pedestrian precinct Smith yep excellent so that gives you an indication of where those different features are so moving on to residential the extent of those zones is SP the simple equation central recovery plan so let 's its whites to find a net wing for this alright the witch one on that page down the bottom you have to pair this I just will go to the legend unbelief leap into our truth is the large-format retail then we can 't change that at all not nice collisions right clay right on so moving on to residential the only significant difference there to reflect what 's come through hearings is additional provision for some non-residential activities in terms of gusta comment this example is there like community facilities community welfare facilities for each episode is here yeah emergency service facilities Co fire stations those sorts of things the okay I understand they 'd like is that there is what has come through from the human dependent hearing panel get those prabhat those activities should be permitted LX in terms of my community correction what what 's there and therefore because it 's one of the activities that has come through from that hearing but I 've got a place in Peterborough straight which is probably close to a residential area but currently it 's not really an issue if you go out first people go through the roof but so the existing land in the central city but I 've got their facility on earth would they need another facility in a residential area in that in the central city sorry I don 't know what you 're talking about in peterborough street I 'm the PD Center the Correctional Center look I didn 't even know there 't it that 's good that shows that it 's you know working and there 's no need for it to go into a residential area we eventually it really shitty so I can 't I don 't know any more details than what I 've expressed do we have to notify her sorry do we have to notify it as a community correction facilities as a permitted activity because if it 's a permitted activity then you don 't you don 't get the opportunity to engage with your community and I 've used this so many times but we put a plea center and pages road and Bixley where I used to live the big c Residents Association worked with the entire neighborhood to socialize the issue to have discussions about how it would be managed it was the ideal location because on a main road there was nothing around it apart from a service station and that was so there was no reason for people to stay there and hang around if you had it on a residential area particularly like stanwell road where I remember it place to put a PD Center you get a community up in arms and I used to live in that area at the time as well so you get two different approaches depending on the nature of where it goes it shouldn 't be a permitted activity in a residential area it should be that really should be focused on those main thoroughfares where there 's no reason to hang around so I don 't_''_663.22 I helpful to you madam chair all we 're trying to find Scott Blair the residential hearing has just finished yesterday yeah and I 'm happy to bring him through to discuss how these aspects went through that chapter through the hearing of course there 's no decision release so so there 's no so if we already notified the residential chapter generally there no Community Correctional Services wats come through during the hearing and what the panel has indicated of course there is no decision released and that 's why I 'm offering if you like to bring scott blair through who was at those hearings well this is what i 'd like to the panel for you perhaps we should move on yeah well they 're finding Scott victoria street they would imagine in one so the next zone is the guest accommodation zone and discovers the hotel will get further information around those if we could just wait until Scott arrives and he can tell you what happened which is what 's caused us to be in here and if should you disagree with that you 're within your rights of course to change what 's being proposed before it goes to the minister 's right and just on the residential can I just check is there anything in terms of the naps we have rezone residential and to another use again I would defeat a separate there would be Scott is the planner who has seen the residential hearings all the way through all right so guest accommodation yes this is an example that was this used to be these areas used to be his own looking five and are currently zoned central city residential and the operative plane these are the large hotel sites in the central city and we ccrp and I 'm just for some simplification and we 've introduced some specific objectives and policies for that zone yep open space so these zones are very much like the open space zones that you would have heard about in stage 2 the only exception to that being the auvergne rule which is a special zone created through the christchurch central recovery plan it 's it 's quite limited and you see that the first the one bullet point there is to provide for development of the former Oxford on Aven site so normally there is restrictions in terms of retail buildings all those sorts of things but on this one particular site which wrong with that but and previously for example if one of the restaurants on the strip wanted to serve coffee on the avon river bank or anything then we 're allowed to that was major major hassle is that permitted or not permitted I 'd have to look at the rules a neater neater see if she can tell you what the situation is the Central 's at the Edinburgh precinct is pretty much like of the river running through the park the only difference is because it includes the roads adjacent to the river and the Esplanade reserves or parts then along the river as well as victoria park there is an exemption for building setbacks for buildings as fronting the roads that does not mean that the buildings will be put in the I know it you Sam I 'm just getting to it so then the buildings can be right up to the road and then you you 've got the Esplanade reserve in the river and and the use the commercial if you like use allowing say cafes are limited to existing facilities within the zone itself the ones adjacent to even reverb dressing precinct can obviously have we unintentionally or intentionally allowed for any building whatsoever on Victoria Square know right it 's fine and the second I mean that the buildings are discretionary activities so that would have to to a resource consent and be assessed in terms of appropriateness of any development right okay and the second one I appreciate that the buildings can 't_''_964.38 be on the spill over onto that area are you thinking tables and chairs or die yeah and well it 's no it 's it 's not explicitly permitted for if you like I could request that you would probably have to that would be probably too at two levels of processes or permissions if you like one would be too sorry resource consent for that kind of use on the land under their district plan but the other would be permission from green space to actually permit very sort of use thank you very much so yep so moving on I 'll talk about both this slider next one because it 's the same issue both the school zone in tertiary education zone the only point here is an amendment that 's simply a meant to align the tombs for minor and click the roads to the actual tombs that have been used in the ccrp and then in fact have been used and the transport chapter as well for unlimited discovery unlimited coming back into town I would imagine that there is these are zones for existing schools so if it being like a chance rayon in the CBD part of the central city I would imagine would be it hasn 't been announced wouldn 't that be a interesting business so in any way we 'll be within a block of where it previously was in case you 're more education activity from memory is permitted I 'll just confirm that in a commercial zone yeah okay yes that is in the commit in the central city zone 800 no sir have to be amazing page 4 of the document titled draft proposed chapter chapter 13.1 central city general and commercial so it 's allowed no problems and it 's allowed to open late subject to standards in terms of I don 't recall there being any hours of restrictions on hours of operation kingfish so moving on on skulls so have we got any objectives so our support schools being in this intro city they 're really important but what I can 't understand is why schools should take on residential land because obviously we want people living in the central city so here we got any objectives that they can build up on this site over my problem of that there isn 't the phils owner pages just sit and basically other things called image us see what other miscellaneous educational uses and special zones but existing schools are simply not really expanding anyway so it hasn 't been a bigger sheet to date but there has been through the residential zone hearings and a show about the scale of activity for non-residential a charity that you can have in a residential zone and I 'm not completely up to date with what the outcome of that is so what 's you take one of the most attractive places to live in the central city which is the inner city west area we know schools are buying up residential properties and trying to get them resigned into educational so I can 't see the scenes in having a single-story school that 's not increasing its role on a residential area that could accommodate in terms of density probably a hundred people living there are you talking central study or genius interested a yeah so so we want people intensive housing so I 'm like Chester Street I think it was might even kill more straight was cathedral grammar have just got consent not notified can seem for a single-story dwelling not to expand their role just to expand their school footprint on prime residential land I think that 's something that we probably can 't do anything about because obviously the private schools in particular I 'm not necessarily a central study but anywhere have been expanding over time last because I understand that but from a policy objective of wanting people to live in the central city reducing the capacity of that central city in terms of residential to enable actually something that has no positive net benefit you 're not getting more children and tower you 're just simply getting land that 's got valuable use from an hour of a point of view being swallowed up with an inefficient use of land so it perhaps to help answer that question the only permitted education activities and the central city residential zone small-scale they have to occupy listing 200 square meters of building area they are hours of operation is they 're quite restricted in terms of what what 's allowed heirs are permitted activity so for the probably the sort of situation that you 're talking about you 're looking at a situation where they would require a resource consent so then a non notified resource consent for an activity with it like I don 't want to make it easy for them to get concedes which is currently the case there 's no traffic assist me they say things like a role won 't extend so they don 't need a traffic assessment and yet traffic in that area is really dangerous I can 't need a trafficker season and soup circuses yeah I think it needs to be alive are a high threshold for them if that 's what they want to do we have to make it you know a high through sold so it should include then you only saying they don 't need a traffic and 6th are saying they do need a traffic concern and Sue can we have a comms can we clarify this so we know what but i believe the threshold for education activities as if you 've got more than a hundred and fifty we hear the click of assessment perhaps to the Sakura for the question about notification non-compliance with those standards that i mentioned before is not limited in any way in terms of notification it 's a restricted discretionary activity or in some cases issue should be sheer full discretionary activity of the education activity is for more than 200 square meters it 's a full discretionary activity they buy the residential area and they say we 're only going to do a small development we 're not going to increase the role we 're only going to do because they can get around the consenting notification on traffic assessment requirements by saying we 're just going to do this so they acquire the property they get the consent they get it resigned or you know permitted for educational and it 's the most inefficient use of land and it doesn 't go through the process so I just want to learn from this so that it doesn 't happen again because is there a particular area of school that you prefer your grammar kill more stroke cathedral grammar right come on straight so you should be like okay we 'll look at that could you get a get it get a quick report on it happen with that one and if we could use that as an example so that there isn 't the potential for for these existing schools to expand their footprint I know and this manner that I mean I think that 's the learning that yes yeah and he 's trying to Ray and we are back to you on that place yep just just in general though I might make the comment that bringing more people into the central city does mean that there is likely to be a need for schools in the city even with the earthquakes and people moving out of the city for example the effect has been that it 's been very difficult a toilet scroll of a cathedral grammar you will find that most of the parents and most of the children do not love and the same know that off the suspense I understand that but you 're saying that that 's the increased living and the central city that will require the school so now that exactly that 's one yeah i 'm just adding some information are pictures that it 's not just people that live there it 's people who work and the sarasota my audience scores can take advantage of the position that they 're on and it will look at that cathedral grammar doing it back to you or private schools yeah yeah push for inner-city learn as there is going to be in the next 5-10 years this is in fact preparing for the future and whether it 's independent schools state school and we are going to need more schools in the inner city to support families and other people living in the city that we will be here yeah it 's true which is why the discovery school well yeah but freeones because the choice for private education is such a limited market yeah so Friday Carol so they cannot resist symmetries this is zone right _"

    "text": "involved in the to-and-fro there what we 're going to do today is just have the briefings on the individual chapters and so we 're not going to make any decisions today but and I think we 'll go through the the briefings and and then we 'll just have a short period for any initial questions but just remember that we 're going to will come back next friday and i haven 't even looked at my diary next friday but it 's probably awful you know but we 'll come back next friday and and have the votes on it and and maybe people can and that week take the time to sort of ya go through it we haven 't got a full day next week we 've got we 've got other committee meetings already set up so yeah yeah we may have to review how we how we notify these chapters fill a mamas goes into the process especially because of the weekend would it be helpful if in fact we compile their questions and sent them to stuff maybe you as I 'm aware of you I 'm happy for you to do that absolutely and yes I think we will need to make some more time available apart from the two hours i was just going to add madam chair that we don 't have the presentation for natural hazards for you here today for stage 2 because only because some of the maps were incomplete so next friday we would have to do that presentation as well and then look at the recommendations but happy to take any questions and we can go through those next friday after the net razors presentation before we do any recommendations okay all right so let 's just see how we go today right oh and of course we 've got the adjournment at 12 and i 'll be getting someone to cheer the meeting if Jamie 's not here then I 'll have to get that the meeting to elect someone to cheer the meeting you 're going to be here all morning no no it 's not at 12 between 11 and 12 I need someone ok so maybe someone else could cheer the 'll come back at 12 and we 've got the global wave which is our opportunity as a council to contribute to a worldwide global wave and as a introduction to the non-proliferation nuclear non-proliferation treaty talks on the other side of the world and our our contribution to that will join all of the other contributions from around the world and that 's at twelve o 'clock sorry I didn 't know about yeah yeah less than half now yeah that 's right and we we 've got some outside speakers coming we 've got Gary Moore who was the first chair of them ears for peace and in Cait Jews as well so and we 've also got Royce unclear who 's the sort of head of the chapter of the Christchurch chapter of the world peace Bell Association who will lead us and the wave to the camera so yeah I think it 'll be a really neat thing to do right so just before you begin if I could just bring your attention to where we are at the stage three chapters are new chapters that is for us to familiarize you with them and in the section 32 s and then for you to take your time over the next week to look through them give me any questions and then we will deal with recommendations hopefully next Friday so the first step and taking these chapters on board of course is for you to approve them to go to the ministers for their comments and indeed that 's what the approvals that 's what the recommendations will be about next Friday there will also be some recommendations to amend some of the information that 's gone to you because again there have been things that have been changed at the last moment so again we 'll deal with those recommendations on detail next week so we can begin with the Central City chapter this is this chapter in the natural and cultural heritage chapters are the largest chapters pages wise this chapter has everything in it related just to the geographical area of the central city so Peter II Men as coordinating it and leading it but as you 'll see there are a it I 've it to be this is brigette said my main role has been as coordinator along with Kimberly rotten the to me the chapter authors in the technical expert so here we 've got particularly been questions to ask today to answer those and also I 'm proposing to skip feeding lightly over the natural and cultural environment issues in the Central City natural headed and so forth because you 'll be getting much fuller presentations on those other than perhaps highlighting a few things that are particularly relevant to the Central City the presentation actually includes recommended amendments and resolutions but I 'll skip over the resolutions and just mention the nature of the amendments as we go so that as Bridget said the chapters are self-contained chapter server has everything in it doesn 't rely on reference to any other parts of the plan it has its own city definitions other than in terms of strategic directions as you will be aware the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act requires that the plane being consistent that our proposed plan be consistent with the Christchurch central recovery plan so rules and policies and so we it has made those amendments the council is quite limited in terms of what it could do in this chapter the is noted will appoint their the provisions therefore largely reflect what is already in the central Christ ship central recovery plan and our operative plane there are the only differences tend to be where the Gypsy recovery plan did not deal with an issue so there 's more scope for something different in those circumstances or where particular circumstances have required a different approach as an example there 's been a recent case that concluded that it was not legally appropriate to require the use of resource consents to approve Oh DPS Ellen developed plans and then require compliance of other developments with that outline development plan now that 's Ellen development plans were required for the central part of the central city the core area for any development so that approach has been changed and you 'll see that when we get onto the commercial zones to require restricted discretionary applications so there have been some changes but they 're fairly limited those significant changes from the operative plane and just to remind you all of course this this chapter only relates to the geographic area of the central city that 's defined by the four heirs to side yep so Amelia that doesn 't include the northern side a billion right in front from new health as well so doesn 't degrade the southern side that accursed teenz teenz it not rolls to the far side of piggyback yep so sorry can I ask can this be enlarged it 's quite small container full screen so one of the changes and it 's really almost more formatting changes that we 've taken some of the few pictures on policies that were scattered through various zones in the ccrp and put them into a general central city objective section now that was done because some of those computers and policies related to more zones than just that zone and which was put and so we thought it was useful to give to put those more overarching objectives and policies into a front section so for example that the whole principle of having around that that 's now reflected in the objectives the general objectives rather than setting just in the central business zone simplicity business own but the the effect of those of teachers the outcomes are seeking still the same I mentioned well I 'm kind of don 't want to stop the flow of things but if it depends what your question is I mean like yannis one was perfectly appropriate what are the boundaries yeah so what 's yours there 's is one of the matters of discretion I mentioned that now it 's been changed that 's the second bullet point that is little bit to move on to that is the controllers now as a restricted discretionary activity and one of the matters of discretion is compliance with outlined Valentin 's of this existing outline development plan then that can be considered at the time of that restricted discretionary activity so is there in the central city recovery plan requirements that 's been brought into our district plan or is this is that one of the changes which is a new provision that we 're bracing yes that was in the ccrp because the ccrp mechanism has been determined to not be legal when was there it 's a Coonskin case max D Munson and probably tell us cuz he 's the expert on me those are there was a case in Queenstown during the last year in fact where our plan change that Queenstown Lakes District Council were promoting they sought they proposed rules which required an outline development plan to be prepared and approved and then the subsequent development to comply with that ODP and the particular one of the matters that the court found was ultra vires book or unlawful was to require compliance with a plan that 's only been approved by consent so there 's no issue with a rule requiring compliance with the plan that 's in the plan but if a plans only been approved by results can send your gun before a subsequent consent to comply with an earlier consent and where 's this mentioned in the section 32a there were maybe in the commercial section 32 utilities and a team peru watch says you should be run I the oh sorry as I 'm so section 2 which is headed specific assessments and if I take you to six and two point one which has headed commercial zones and then and then over the page from that it starts at the bottom sorry under the heading requirement for now hello development plan in compliance with it and the retail precinct of the central city business sir and there 's page two then goes on all of page two talks about what I 've conveyed and parts a rule that does not specify an activity I did it only specifies requirement for approval of a development plan as ultra virus and it 's ultra berries that are ma is that it was in the context of the Resource Management Act that that decision but by the court was made and the proposed rule is still seeking the same outcome of integration and a comp and connect connectivity between different developments in the retail precinct that 's it 's not diminishing the outcome we want it 's just a different method so rather than requiring an outline development plan for it 's saying that all developments in the retail precinct has to come forward for consent and that amongst other matters will consider the integration of that development with its surroundings and the ODP process was very much to achieve that connectivity with the surroundings to ensure a sharing of where possible of parking and access at what in my mind that the outcome is really the change in the method rather than changing the outcome that we 're proposing but I mean hasn 't it been the 7500 square square meters hasn 't that actually been the problem and in the CBD no no we don 't have a choice around it but I mean isn 't this something that we could highlight because you know the intention behind her oh no and this is why I always say that for every plan consequence they can be an unintended consequence and that the plan consequence of us was to ensure that people you know couldn 't kind of hold out but it 's actually created a worse hold out provision because people you know play games over the 7500 getting rid of the 7500 for children saying any development to requires consents and that in assessing those consents will consider the integration of that individual development with its surroundings so oh ok so there 's 7500 so that phrase that some near is what 's in our current plan and that 's going as it their requirement for an outline development plan for a minimum area of 7,500 square metres is going on no no no that this has got to go to the ministers so but but when we because I have to say that so just just run me through the argument so I 'm just going to pretend that I 'm the minister receiving this advice from the council that they 're not going to proceed with the 7,500 square metre requirement but you 're saying that instead there 's going to be a restricted discretionary activity around so what rather than the operative provision which requires an outline development plan for a minimum area of 7,500 square metres councils putting forward that any development district choir is required to obtain resource consent as a restrictive through the blocks which was the intention of the 7500 but it was a rough-and-ready measure that actually didn 't work and as in my view held up retail development yeah I know I know I know well apart from the core area which includes our car part and the proposed consenting requirement will enable integration of development with its surroundings it will enable consideration of access and connectivity which the same access and connectivity which the same things that we 're tends to be covered by the early p price it is exactly right well that 's great oh well I 'm actually pleased that you asked that question counsel about very pleased find out a few more things because cool I mean words on paper dough so that just not Holly bit sizing is actually hearing what 's good so but but can we carry on through but hearing that the ODP was actually ultra virus as really fantastic and so I 'm assuming that that has to go now does that if it 's already ultra virus no no you just nobody does to challenge I mean we 're taking a precedent and actually the way I read that section 32 it says recent case law suggests that it could be ultra vires okay so doesn 't say it is Ultra Magnus our legal advice is suggested it 's ultra virus but there 's always someone that may contest that exactly sorry so at the mercial zone and they 're very in the central city such as the convention center which has the potential to be kind of pack and say vish this is the retail precinct yeah yeah that 's fine still central city no no but we 're on we 're just going through firsts at the moment then that commercial zone yeah the requirement we 're just going through the bullet point is he Asian or just dealt with the ODP and the retail first night so if we can just carry on through I 'm sure we 'll get to a convention center site or an anchor project site at some point ah well that in fact the last will appoint is in terms of a significant differences that in the commercial local that may not necessarily serve their local community which is the purpose of those zones has been changed to discretion it to vary rather than permitted activity so that there is no proposal to change anything in terms of the Convention Center which my memory is that it 's that is actually outside the and retail freezing yeah yeah the requirement and the operative plan for in a development plan for the 7,500 only applies to the block between Oxford 's Oxford terrace litchfield street high street wasn 't talking about OTPs i 'm talking about connectivity and um a building interfaces with the public which we know to be really really important yeah the description of what you 've provided to us has attracted us in terms of the broader cbt rather than focusing solely on the retail precinct so are there other parts of the CBD where that rule will apply I 'll just need to refer back to the provisions to confirm there 's a design a rule requiring a design assessment it 's not so much design we 're really interested in all those words you into group integration I mean edit openness yeah so then it 's not closed off from people that is exactly what we want for the CBD and it 's what the people crash it said they wanted as well yeah I 'll come back to you shortly about the rule in terms of urban design assessment but I should point out David designs more than just appearance it 's about connectivity and I understand that but it doesn 't sort of seemed to be an understand every time this gets debated in the public arena it 's like the council 's trying to apply rules about the way things look and it isn 't about that and I think you know we actually want to kind tell the positive story which is that the connectivity accessibility and connectedness they 're all part no actually there 's I just seen things twice what was the muscle connectivity axis and integration integration that 's that 's really about what what people want to see and the sense of openness is just the fear that things will get closed off and it will to use my favorite phrase which is there is not enough prosaic in the world to make this enough an exciting place to be when looking at a blank wall along a city street just building buildings its building these spaces I know and the building 's make the spaces if they allowed to well and that is a wider sense of urban design that is what Evan design does it is not just about how ability I know that the public don 't necessarily see it because words we get attacked on the in the public arena for wanting things to look the way that we want them and it 's not about that so I kind of want to lift the level an update around the CBD because you know people are you know really came to see a great place atkin soon and you would have been at the Charles Montgomery thing the other night about how they measured the happiness of people when they were standing outside small shops as opposed to a black wall and how dramatic was the difference and we we all know potentially sort of pact and save type walls with with a building like the convention center and what we are desperately trying to avoid is having those pick and save tables around a convention center and I know it 's called urban design for for urban planners but for normal people and focus for other people sorry I apologies and for other people it 's open design is the wrong term and it 's not what we understand by it so potentially we can add I perfectly on stand what you 're saying and in the wide world that the term urban design absolutely is understood to mean those things but if you prefer we can add some other language or words alongside the urban design yeah description of water beside them a description of what urban designer means in that regard would it be very helpful for the public it 's to focus a bit like and when you change when the people change the concept of public realm two streets and spaces or so something that is kind of more usual words but the key point is how it doesn 't become thick and safer well we will get to that ok class and ok fantasia ok and what you 're raising of the issues that we 've been trying to raising trying to raise through all of the chapters da residential industrial commit I remember them from residential and commercial and that 's why I 'm desperate they have them in the central city is absolutely but too much of it is retained I can 't guarantee but yeah no no we understand then it will go through the through the presentation and happy to take questions as you go as long as you don 't lose the thread of certainly would go on _"

    "text": "right so we just have residential up first you have been through all of this but there are some amendments that Sarah would like to Sarah Oliver would like to take you through before the chapter is notified and then if you have any further questions on those matters that that you have decided a fall for example character areas Sarah can show you where they are now and the vision to be notified in section 32 if you wish that then we need to go on and settle the matter of the sale of alcohol rules and then the last one is the inland port and then if we could just approve all of the recommendations for stage 2 then we can move on to the stage 3 meeting yep I think you 've gone through oh right I 'll just I just show you 've got three pieces of paper here attachment a attachment B and attachment see I 've been through all the residential material with you so this is just really to say that the documentation that was provided to you mr. an appendix 38 but document because it 's every character area category 1 and tights and a little met bot so then city including it 's the first resolution see that it be included the second resolution 4.2 is about just including some in the to be notified so these are just appendices and they 're just bringing through various livin g a pimp existing appendices there just to explain some of the rules so they were just must at and the document that was printed and the food I resolution sort as just it really it 's an updating of all the outline development plans and it 's just a list and that 's to be included it 's just one of the provisions and the proposed draft and that 's so that 's 14 6.4 so its attachments see so it 's just been an updated list of the items said that those are the only change of sort right okay jaani sorry just just help me understand the difference between category 1 and 2 again oh we 're not going to go back over old ground this is approving the maps already made yeah except I thought what we were doing is also moving some from category one to category two no no no that this this is M as you decided a week yes this is it 's already been decided this category my memory too I mean I 'm going to move the amendment do I have a seconder for the amendment Phil Clearwater so is there any discussion on that i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you thank you thank you just moving on to the sale of alcohol rules and the general rules and procedures chapter this is on page two if you want to see it on the spiral bound copy and this is the one remaining piece that hasn 't been decided on because of the potential over lips with the lip local alcohol policies i have ellison here who has received some more legal advice on this matter and she could take you through there mmm and I 'd also like to write up with little wood here 's the policy who is a senior alcohol licensing inspector so we 've received additional legal advice with regards to potential the potential relationship between district plan rules governing sale of alcohol and the local alcohol policy so I 've distributed that ahead of the meeting so you should find on your desk on that advice and also some extracts from the Cylons apply of alcohol act for reference and the council needs to have particular regard at this stage to the minister 's comments on the sale of alcohol provisions which are that it would be a more appropriate method for the district plan to control these activities central areas through a local alcohol policy rather than through the district plan the officers recommendation is still to retain the sale of alcohol provisions in the district plan the local alcohol policy and the sale supply of alcohol act are not intended to supersede district plan provisions there are several sections of the saylon supply of alcohol acts that show that there 's that can at least be both and if they 're meant to have complementary relationship to each other so you of alcohol Act section 93 a that a local alcohol policy may contain a policy more restrictive than the relevant district plan provisions and that a local alcohol policy does not authorize anything forbidden by the relevant district plan so there 's clearly intended to be a relationship between the district plan rules and the local alcohol policy missy so whatever we put in the local alcohol policy overrides the district plan no no right I 've misunderstood apologies no they work in conjunction with each other and there are certain matters that can 't go in the district plan that are covered by the local alcohol policy in and vice versa so look I 'll colossi can be more restrictive than a district plan and then what ways it it can 't well in terms of the the hours that it sets but it can 't authorize anything that 's forbidden by the district plan so if the district plan says that you can 't have licensed premises in a particular location the local alcohol policy can 't write override that but it can see the ads regardless of 't have anything to do with ask the district plan provisions um do relate two hours so ideally they wouldn 't be contradicting each other but it is possible for the policy to have a policy that 's more restrictive than the district plan with a type a to be more restrictive than the district yeah yeah thank you the issue that we 've gotten is that then the draft la_._385.33 Paix that 's been prepared doesn 't include these provisions because they were dealt with in the operative plane so but uh sorry I 've just literally yeah that or ether so we Abel 's I 'll just walk through okay the advice that was given and then I 'm happy to take questions also it 's worth noting in section one hundred that the first step for applying for a license is to get a certificate of compliance with the district plan so it 's another reference between the two different documents so the council there 's nothing in the sound supply of alcohol acts that says that the council can 't also have district plan rules so a lap to have a lap and district plan rules or to not have a lap if it chooses so I think that the next question to consider is whether or not the lab can replace the district plan rules because the minister 's comments are and the statement of expectations are that if it 's possible to have a more simple process that 's still effective that that should be the preferred option so at this which is worth just briefly discussing what the object is of the Salem supply of alcohol act versus the object of the purpose of the RMA so the object of the saylon supply of alcoholics I 'm set out in section 4 is to reduce harm caused by excessive or inappropriate consumption of alcohol it 's particularly focused on behavior so any harm to society caused by crime or disorderly behavior as a result of sale of alcohol versus the purpose of the RMA which is to manage the environmental effects so it gets a little bit there 's a little bit of overlap in terms of section 105 and the sound supply introduced in the criteria for the issue of licenses and this gives the district licensing committee the authority to consider in section 105 1 and h whether its opinion the amenity and good order of the locality would be reduced as a result of the license so depending on how the amenity in good order is defined by the district licensing committee there 's potential for the license to consider some of the effects like noise effects that are traditionally considered under the district plan so there are some of those amenity effects can now be considered as part of the licensing process but there 's other effects that can 't under the RMA or sorry under the sales applied on final act or under a local alcohol policy so those are things like traffic generation or anything that 's not related to the licensing process so things like if we wanted to have rules around controlling where they where late night premises were in terms of distribution effects so if we wanted to control them in terms of the central city recovery or for reasons other than amenity in rather than local alcohol policy rules so it is it is possible in some sense for some of the things that are controlled by the district plan rules to be controlled by a local alcohol policy for example in section 77 this deals with the location so 77 1 a is that a local alcohol policy may include policies relating to licensing of location of licensed premises by reference to broad areas so it is it 's possible for the local alcohol policy to include rules relating to residential zones but it 's worth keeping in mind that the local alcohol policy is only a policy and this is the legal advice if you have a look aggression on paragraph 17 and paragraph 18 which is that the local alcohol policy can set a policy but it can 't set standards for things like noise so the district licensing committees and there 's four different district licensing committees in Christchurch each of them can potentially interpret amenity in good order in a different way there 's nothing the sale and supply of Alcoholics that set standards for noise so it that process and it would be through the RMA well the two different paper says that so yeah thing yeah so the only thing that 's sort of kind of sitting at the back of my mind is that the independent hearings panel may not agree with us advice so that leaves us exposed to a district plan that doesn 't make provision for these measures and a la p that can 't yet so we can 't lose this no well in our hearings in the evidence we will be tabling all of this yeah and and if there is something to the opposite by some other party then we 'll have to deal with that through through evidence so is there some risk though that we will be exposed to a mess of and mess of gap and out well I guess rear is risk with anything that we put in front of the panel and I don 't think that this is controversial in the sense that what does show soon as we 've not only had regard to the minister 's advice we sought legal adviser it can be dealt with and the advice that we have received is that it can 't_''_728.26 be dealt with that 's correct that 's right not sufficiently know what it can 't be no but than they says you can 't it 's good you can 't look at noise traffic all of those things that are regulated under the DPR you can 't you can 't regulate that through a local alcohol plan you can 't in theory but it 's a new process and it hasn 't been tested and what you 're basically do we want servant from the canoe we want to see a new process that 's being tested do we want to leave people exposed to it no no all right so we go ahead with notifying the existing provisions on the distance between residential properties then right yep excuse me that doesn 't need a recommendation that will be covered by the overall recommendation yeah that 's right because that 's what you 're recommending so we 'll go was the officials recommendation cetera yep good thank you thank you and the the weather we need to be looking at the LA p so maybe we could have a meeting next week okay thank you very good can you organize it with my office yes yep thank you and the last meter is on page 169 and your spiral bound copies it was to do with the inland port and the officers recommendation there and a commercial and industrial page 169 okay so now this is the one that Jonnie wanted to have a vote on it so create and we 've had the discussion and everything 's up like that so if you 'd like to move your amendment yani then i can take the vote or if you just want to vote against it do that we remove the office officer recommendation which one oh it 's on a page 169 so the offers a recommendation is to include a new policy so that no more then you just vote against it there 's no need to know because if because we don 't want it going forward why don 't like going forward so we need to like we it from the recommendations no no what we 've been doing is we 've been voting on each individual recommendation and with if they carry that goes forward if they 're lost in there they they come out hey would you like to run the meeting behaves honesty not do it your way that 's fine okay okay i just like to speak to this possible now we 've already dealt with it we see that we would hold the vote today if there 's other councils in the road that haven 't dealt fur it doesn 't matter because we would have dealt with it on the day except that I said that I wasn 't gonna take split votes on on Wednesday so so so what is the easiest way of doing that or maybe I 'll let you move it all right you move that it be deleted so that Jonnie is moving that that the the proposal to include a new policy which reads to enable regionally significant and then port infrastructure to operate efficiently and safely through provisions that enable port activities while limiting the so yeah Lee moves that that 'd be deleted and those seconds that I 'm sort of seeking a pro forma because I think a quick explanation as to where yo knees come from will be a bit of democratic process for something we are now going to vote on I 'll sorry about I know what they was near okay all right yeah knee explain um so what you need to understand what stage one is done is is removed highlights from industrial here is owned and changes to represent some sit there so my main concern is that removing everything that has any control over where the port 's developing and I just drove their past their yesterday they 're sticking containers up to a really high level this is an area that has other existing uses it 's not too far from some residential areas so I actually think that the port should have to deal with some of the issues around sensitivity to the existing environment and I can 't see continuously removing any sort of immunity requirements or height limits or assessment STD activities on fear I recognize the port has an important place to play in terms of significantly a significant infrastructure but I just don 't think it 's right that people are not involved in what and the activities that they 're doing and I don 't think it 's right to limit it and give them unfettered discretion to keep doing activities which may have impacts on people that are already did so and I 'd like to respond to that and that that 's as may be but we 've already passed those provisions that 's already and the plan all this does is includes a new policy statement and the objectives policies and rules component of the and then port so it 's the recommendation and industrial is to provide specific recognition of that and then thought and objectives policies and rules and basically the policy just simply cease to enable region ii significant and then port infrastructure to operate efficiently so it doesn 't it this clause does not create the problem it 's simply a statement of our requirement to have policies that relate to an and 've got smooth counselor Johansson seconded Phil Clearwater and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that 's lost but we 'll have a show of hands so those in favor of the amendment 1 2 3 4 and against one two three four so that 's doesn 't proceed was it fun one two three four one two three four five I can help still off abstaining it was foreign favor I think wasn 't it yeah right so right so that 's that one yes so now we just need to go back to the rest of the recommendations for all of stage two there are overarching recommendations and I think they 're coming up shortly and that was generally to approve the chapters on the basis of all of these exceptions yep to be publicly notified on the second of May as we go through them we should take them off as it 'll go through them yep well I 'm move the overarching recommendation someone like to second that Paul Don style so we don 't need 't think so but you might want to just scroll down take receive the minister 's comments and have regard to them approve the staff recommendations as amended below remove approve the recommendations table and cooperating any changes made by counsel no we 've done definitions approve any changes to be made to the stage two proposals approve the draft stage two proposals no we 're just we 're just going through the final thing we do we did that on we did they 're all on Wednesday we did the definitions but the definitions were only just a minor change and cats right can you can you get the person that did the definitions thing to talk to Vicky directly yes oh yes oh yeah yeah i guess because i 'm pretty sure that I know what right and a bit the definitions chapter doesn 't create no it 's just like the thing we 've just done on the policy the definitions chapter doesn 't create the rule the rule is created yep okay well you yeah if you can have a pretty yeah so approve the recommendations proposals to approve the draft stage two proposals approve the modified changes to the minister 's comments is tabled at them meeting and then scroll through because there are a number of ones that are just related to specific topics and then we remember I need and there were six point six fear just that all stage two chapters remove all references to stage three chapters before notification yeah because your recall that we had the coastal environment and you know we pushed up to stage three that 's right alright so that 's been moved and seconded so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no jana johansson record opposed so thank you right _"

  {
    "text": "well i think i think that the the that 's a possibly other hearings panel may decide that but it doesn 't i think the council if it has a different view to what is in the plan change has a duty under its i think in reviewing ass district plan but we we 've done that through our submission presumably this is what would put an hour submission it 's consistent with our submission to understand it yeah yes that i mean mr. Matheson may have a better idea that i have on this split some what ivan is saying is that it would appear that the ministers would prefer that we go the simple away and simply have one set of rules to consider all the hearings pin or his wad City rules to consider and that 's the plan change what we 're saying is legally speaking we do have this right to also so no weed legally speaking had the right to do the same with little tongue but we 're not doing that because it had basically to do that so I just want to I think there may be a difference of you around the table so can we just the fear this one to Friday yeah yeah okay I mean is that last time we were briefed on the private plan change we heard that dis emissions from the applicant were significantly different to the notify plant church so that raised a whole nother point of law around how much you could actually very what was notified so when it comes back I mean I 'm happy to do all that today but if you don 't want to do that then you know I think we need to get someone know well I didn 't know that so are you saying that the submitters on the plan change that I mean the proposed proponents of the plan change have actually submitted a different outcome than what they 've actually proposed yes I can 't I can 't answer that question I 'm sorry again but what I better feel maybe that is the case then that is the basis for putting us up perhaps there is too yes the submission lodged by watch it they actually proposed Raja Lisa it 's almost like a another plan change the difference also between the port and the mail site is at the port of course is subject to a land use recovery plan that 's right so that 's the reason why in that case the counselor said there is a process that will get inserted into the plan right now difficulty with the plan change is that the applicant can actually withdraw the plan change even after the hearings panel has made his decision right which would then leave us with a void if they were to do that and that would put the council in a very legally difficult position because it actually has not done a review of the district plan okay or oh yeah I 'm very clear that we need to do this and we should do it that 's good and when but I think that you know it is it is really useful for us to explicitly say why we 're we 're doing this and I think that it would be worthwhile even myself writing to recommendation on this and it is because if it 's got a legal basis as you 've highlighted in that 's a very good position for us to be we need to man we need to secure the council 's position yeah do that yeah okay community to make submissions yeah otherwise may not offer oh that 's fine okay so that 's that one what 's the next one the next one is the motorway i 'm going to met the show you where the motorways cuts across a one of the greenfield industrial areas and it sort of part of the corner we haven 't leaves owned even though it 's it 's a priority area and the loop the minister of the crown sir recommendation is we should resign that area however there are some significant traffic concerns if we resign that piece of land on the other side of the motorway and secondly then this is my view is that the motorway provides a much more robust demand boundary anyway it 's we 're not talking about very much land that has been left out of accept on the basis that access to this land south of the southern motorway extension is constrained by the proposal for a part of the springs road to eat there so there 's that there is a traffic issue as to why that we don 't in a site specific issue as to why we shouldn 't rezoning that land on the other side of the southern motorway it 's a very site specific issue yeah all right yep provide recognition of the inland port this is supported so we agree with the minister here really the other so yeah knee yeah see that in stage one we 've had height limits removed from the industrial heavy zone and changes two versions for set vehicle internal roads I recognize that this mln port will be a different in terms of its activity but I am concerned that again for those existing businesses in that area and actually it 's not too far from a residential area but if you hear things like noise happening 24-7 for example beeping of cranes or whatever equipments being used if you had a pipe support Hills I mean I just think you know we actually need some level of protection rather than just an open kind of canvas for the pool and I don 't see where we 're going to get their protection if we insert this new policy mm-hmm well it 's for the standards for the sign for the actual industrial zone there will be standards about height and noise that will apply here this is just a new policy that 's been put on it 's not changing the development standards that have to relate to the more billions own port so when you talk about but potential for reverse sensitivity affects society with sensitive land uses what does that actually mean because I mean the people that are currently there if suddenly they get you know a hundred containers stacked on each other don 't have as much right to say actually we 're not happy about that that 's great but the video Hibbing industrial zone that the money over what 's written here it seemed to me it 's probably less important than than I need to another I think it 's a balancing exercise and having regard to the environment that is in but look as 1027 and this is a policy wording that 's going on is there an objection there is so we 'll deal with it on Friday okay okay and that 's it it 's under you and so is there anything on definitions that 's going to be controversial 0 there are a few amendments we need to make through a recommendation if you 're okay with that I 'm fairly certain that the amendments were there I mean the actual minister 's comments were fairly straightforward but pets Janine will take you through the the few changes she needs made through recommendation files yep system relation to recommendation 147 I had included and the short list of definitions that were too belated one of which was support activities obviously with the recommendation mass resolution massachusett a to remove the port provisions the additional definition of chlorine activity also needs to come out also we house in a distribution activities is another definition on-ear that can be removed in response to amended phase 1b permissions the second point that was the second point the third point the last recommendation about comprehensive consent of subsequently been advised that the year period should be 10 years as opposed to 35 so it 's more online was the ten-year operation of each plan and that was one example is the definition of temper activities and buildings where they apply to both the general rules and procedures chapter and stage 2 and also the relevant provisions and the Central City chapter and stage 3 and basically what are we doing is replicating that definition specific to each of those professions in each of those stages and that fourth resolution as a Caesar feet till they did that as just making each definition specific to the stage which hears yep I 'm happy to move that seconder second it though yani it 's seriously a are you going to raise some issues about the this recommendation what 's in the definition so no no just these recommendations to tidy up technical changes you know this one can we do that i 'll put that motion all 's carried is it would give there is one more section that we haven 't covered which assigns Bagheera waiting for cancer yes we 've done them maps haven 't we and that 's all we 've been through as we 've gone as we 're everything so signs is the only other one right to say with him the different Michelle I know we didn 't need anything else with the definitions we 've already done that chapter this was technical changes that needed to be made as a result as a in response to get a whole bunch of teeth we 've already done them for when did you do well we did them last week time we know we didn 't do the definitions last week I thought we 'd do it no that 's why it 's on the list today so where is it a page 117 it 's quite a significant so this just go through the mud by one so recommendation 144 meeting there 145 146 so oh sorry um not 146 147 yeah okay I just want to understand um what you for example you 've got a whole bunch of read stuff that 's taken out and then you 've got things like entertainment facilities so it 's not exclude privately-owned regression entertainment facilities and restaurants you 've gotta hold on to thank all reliant get donations so I just don 't understand are we making it easier in for more activities that happen in residential areas but basically what this particular recommendation is about as n stage two there are fewer originally 41 definitions which were effectively an amendment of some of the phase 1 definitions and the reason for that is that in some cases it was their stage two chapters that we should have been more appropriately driving the wheeling of those and other instances it was to better align phase one informations with new phase two definitions and other instances of it was like as a relationship as a result of leaders that have changed to a an amendment that we were relying on in our district plan whether obviously that did create some other confusing situation for any user of the plan in the sense that slightly different what the minister has seared is to try and minimize that type of confusion so what we did is we went back and we revisited those 41 definitions to see whether they were effect we 're really needed some of those we 've decided that he subsequently come out in those were the first we lost starting with guest accommodation there was a second set that we 've made the independent here is panel aware of the need for those that mean definitions and they 're going to be considered in due course as part of the hearing on those and it was a third set whereby we were effectively able to give them new definitions applicable to specific chapters with unfazed sickness age 2 only and those are the ones that start with that community equality definition of the read text basically what read textures as an indication of how the face took definition his change from the stage one definition and the black texts where we 've endeavored to make it more specific to a particular chapter or provisions for them staged home so I 'm definitions lead to a more permissive enabling plane at the expense of the community being aware of your other activities been easier to be done without notification I things like car parking as well as the other hot that I had some provision of car parking to attempt vehicle yeah I like things you really comment on the effect of the changes of the definition I 'd be better to delete those questions to the respective check delayed year that 's the thing is is that a declination yeah essent a decision about the context it 's to which it is applied yeah so like a temporary activity if you 've now included that to include workers accommodation that has its always included workers accommodation it 's got well the obvious rent supp and we use another example the temple '_''_893.74 raising of buildings for foundation repairs or whatever so that better I 'm trying to understand there 's any of the changes that you 've got on the definitions changing materially any of those chapters in terms of what notifications or requirements no the notifications aren 't in that this I mean it 's 1035 I said I within this meeting at ten thirty so is this necessary can we give counsel your hands on an absolute assurance that these changes do not change the opera operation of the district thing well each of each of the chapters you have been through and raised issues as you 've gone through all this chapter is trying to do is make everything consistent between the stages and make sure that the definitions actually work so this is this is quite straightforward any issues that you would have picked up before you would have picked them up going through the actual chat that the definitions are applied to and then the last subject as signs yeah so sorry we saved science for you y ahora puzzling you that you will understand about it but page fifty i 'm going to allocate five minutes more I mean that 's I can 't give up any more times this morning we 've got a thousand and one other things today science is an area where the minister 's comments review helpful to us page everything and made the modifications accordingly there was one minor point where we don 't agree and it just refers to how we monitor signs from the electric Commission than NZTA of their motley of monitored under six or 35 they act they have a big an issue so that 's a generally that we have adopted the minister 's comments and clarified accordingly and they have been helpful to us changes anything dear sir if there is a change on a second paper where in the interests of further clarification we 've just made a slight change to the import zone with signage we 've split the we just recognize our two precincts as part of plan change 80 for the aviation and development and basically we 're just specially saying that in the aviation precinct which as we all the airplanes fly around the nose there 's no requirement you know there 's no controls over signage apart to health and safety reasons or operational reasons and that really so that 's its you know we think a relatively minor change I beg your pardon it was page so many a few pages and it is straightforward that they won changed them right questions Yanni so just in terms of the changes on it whether you 've got anything that 's been removed and regards to the commutative effect of signage I don 't think there 's anything removed from as far as Kimberly fix so we get like three billboards in 100 section which is currently allowed the rationalization of the of the rolls is there anything that would you know there 's nothing and the changes that we 're promoting in response to analysis decision which these cumulative effects anything in our plan that addresses cumulative effects assessment methods at the waivers discussion last time I think they were in the assessment matters yes when I read the matters of discretion whether or not occur can see when I go through all those things that you 've got Kelsey here and they talked about human effects on maybe it 's 11 it 's good to live in whether the nature of the silent is such that all combined with existing summoner John are building the site a precedent for fear the similar sign and you 're not you 're not waiting there any way we can notice I think that 's the same wording that was there before we arrest realized those assessment messes I think that 's good oh yeah I wasn 't sure on six point pay what you 're doing there which hating on so that 's a precondition 20 recommendation community yeah and this in pollock middle oh ok so the minister 's comment there was we we should decide whether we 're going to have all the signs under general City rules or have them in different zones I mean they picked up that there the residential zone the utilities have had their own signage rules so what we did we put the utility signage and the general city ruled until this chapter but we felt from the user point of view as much more sensible to hear one or two signings rules and the residential zone because they realize the things like our home of the patients and doing a home occupation has probably be that had the sign control City rules so that was just the list no no no worship that particular recommendation is to move but so that signs all done so madam chair apart from the few things that we 've set aside to go come through to you on I from friday that 's yeah that 's all just right Friday 's a public meeting us yes it is yeah I 'm just not sure that in Friday eternal odd swim I am that is the hospital 's I understand we get some discussion with it the some other on for example real man 3 on page 15 sexes more I just want to be might get include that perhaps briefly on Friday I don 't know we checked off the hospitals are yeah well understanding is lit that you were agree we did go through that today with Jaclyn yep okay what was that what no I just hadn 't had time to go over there that 's all we was a way we could summon God doesn 't we were real we had a good discussion around the underlying zone for Princess Margaret 'd yep sorry so apart from that we 're through them is apart from and let him see once we go through the last remaining factors we should go back then and go through and accept each of the recommendations or recommendations for notification as well well it was yeah but but but then what I mean we can do that in a single motion yes if you can spring that on Friday but just basically adopt the recommendations with the exceptions of the individual recommendations that we 've made on the way through that 's right there is series of simple ones that you can go through just at the end of the fewer the better staged thank you very much so we 've got the perfect i 'm totally fine with ear success that except that we will start with the stage two matters that still need signing off before we get into the stage three meters so completely different people i 'm going to adjourn the meeting so because i actually wonder because we we 're starting the district plan at nine o 'clock i actually wonder be wondering and then we could get this done and dusted and go straight onto the doesn 't it would be wonderful review subcommittee meeting to deal with the chapter three stuff now I 'm just you know I 'm concerned at the amount of time and I know that I 've taken some time out for a global way for the non-proliferation discussions overseas to support that so we 're going to do that it I think twelve o 'clock we 're going to set some time aside for that and we 've got some people coming in from outside to speak on the issues of peace and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons so we 've got quite a busy day so again you know I 'd like us to be very focused and see whether we can move through the day a lot more quick please stay because we 've done quite well today yeah stage 3 madam chair is presentations to you because you haven 't seen any of these chapters before right age three so so it 's a different scenario to what we 've done for being sure you 're aware of what 's in the chapters and the section 30 G 's before they go across to the ministers I guess what stage three is that ok we got the date and front re on something that 's part of Europe oh so it 's always it 's all very carefully set out and so yeah we can meet the notification on the twenty-seventh of June yep that 's actually but I have to say that you know in terms of timing you know timing is everything as I often say for a variety of purposes but to have all of this you know an hour sort of Diaries at the same time as we 're trying to do submissions on the long term plan etc it 's just it is horrendous been anyway hopefully i 'm at the end of end of june will get some respite yes for maybe a few days well and fit and by the end of june this will be well out of your hands are you apart from giving you updates on how hearings are going that 's good all right I 'd you in the meeting thank you so rightly we bring the all those the document _"

because i have to leave early and I we go to just cheer in my absence so yeah but i didn 't_''_44.129 i didn 't know no no but I hate no notification of early leaving so and I didn 't know you were leaving early either rep so well 1030 okay well I can I can adjourn the meeting and we can reconvene it later on no well I mean I 'm just that we do need to have these chapters signed off by the end of the week because otherwise you know I understand the age today I know I know ya know but this was supposed to go to eleven o 'clock you 're here but we 've got a big day on Friday yeah it could it could it just makes it more and more difficult squeezing up officer time we need to achieve yeah we could if that were suitable a Jew doing this tour de tarde let 's just let 's just carry on through until will go to half past ten but I 'm not taking any votes unless people are an agreement on issues I 'm not going to have votes because it 's not reflective of the auditor that we have got a quorum we have got a quorum but if if if people are going to insist on having vote then I 'm going to adjourn the meeting because I can 't have the decision-making essentially controlled so it has to be a decision of the council yes and I 'm happy to continue on the basis of consensus but I 'm not going to take any votes is it agreed is that agreed it 's not a grade so I join the meeting the counselors that are here all that you know that 's fine but if this contentious stuff but I just don 't understand why we wouldn 't advise so we will carry on and if we have consensus then then consensus then I will adjourn the meeting alright so thank you so the open space chapter starts on 147 page 147 it is all fairly straightforward although I will ask for the recommendations to be brought up for the rezoning and these were simply mapping areas that should be corrected through a recommendation yes thank you I don 't know if you 'd like to just roll through the pages that the the ministers table comments are all fairly straightforward yep so if there is anything that you would like me to explain further all discussing though recommendation 1 2 3 recommendation 124 recommendation 125 126 127 128 129 one page of the people there right run duty notice too i thought we 're on chapter 2 definitions no no publicans open space what pages what handle your thirties and that we 're just going through an order so we 've got we 've done yeah 14 and 15 clearly you we 've we 've been doing this all the way through and it 's so you 're up to recommendation 128 on it on page 150 yeah 128 129 you require is just amending some mapping errors as listed above they they have not anything so this doesn 't change the substance of anything that 's just to fix some technical errors i 'm heading to move there do I have a seconder Phil Clearwater i 'll put that resolution all those in favor say aye as opposed to know it 's carried so that 's open space so I just want to raise honey the yield Hearst Sports Academy so clearly what 's recommendation was it 's not it 's basically the general 128 provide a policy framework to reflect the role of open spaces and recreational facilities revitalizing and connecting communities in the current period of earthquake recovery providing social and cultural well-being so on that basis I think we should put that in as a zoning Sorry Sorry what did we get sorry watch which recommendation are you referring to 128 recommendation 128 the minister 's recommendation so what did the minister to provide a policy framework to reflect the roll open space and recreational facilities revitalizing and connecting communities in the current period of youth how is that not addressed on the recommendation because we because we 've said that we 're going to do that as Palast age three and I just can 't see why we would leave it to stage three given the coming from the minister but within the open space that thats top pair top stage three stage three is related to as far as open spaces chipler 's concerned is related to matters that rely on chapter nine natural and cultural heritage rather than anything to do with provision for revitalizing and connecting communities so to a too if you like more explicitly provide for it I have recommended additionally heading to the policies for open space make a clearer reference or perhaps more direct reference to temporary activities as well as still maintaining the predominance of open space rather than having it all built out because there 's always a danger of that the temporary activities and facilities are explicitly provided for as the minister required and in terms of rules later on it it could be expressed in a way of say community gardens if obviously if really the extent of the recommendations from the of the minister and and and they 've been incorporated into the provisions as shown it absolutely meets the requirements of what the minister 's ask for I can 't thanks so that 's so but what we 're doing is not putting it in now we 're waiting to go to the UDI si si si no no no it 's nice and I 'm sorry nice completely done something out of it yeah I 'm a seriously you are a stop this is totally you read the officers reasons and the recommended revision of reading it is totally what the minister asked for you I think you at the point I 'm talking about is on your test ride this is I know what you 're talking about it 's not this check well that 's it 's not in the urban space only on post road and and that 's right has been discussed in the at the time when we were proving open space chapter to go to the ministers which basically leaves it as rural and yep until we get the change through the through through the regional policy statement it 's some conflict at the regional policy statement at the moment that 's right and that 's correct and we haven 't yet received a consent anyway for stage 2 who knows where the stage 2 will go ahead and it may not even require a change to the urban limits that 's in order to allow stage two to go ahead so it 's the enfant Basin that 's coming few absolutely very cool on your desk Soccer Academy will continue as rural until such time as it 's considered that it actually does need to come inside the mu L it may not need to be it 's being assessed currently by it can to see anyway look I 'm sorry yonni it is out of order to raise an issue that is not in this chapter it 's not dealt with in this chapter it 's not part of this chapter the officers reasons and recommendations align one hundred percent with what the Minister has asked for so it 's I 'm just 're asking for is not within this chapter so that 's the open zone open space dealt with we 've got special zone possible purpose hospital yes starts on page 155 right that 's recommendation 133 134 yani um you 're saying it 's it 's oh I know its regulation this is the one that 's near higley park that Gardens know that we 're not doing the central city whistles you 're not doing anything to do mystical City chapter comes on Friday right and in terms of the debate that we had over Princess Margaret yeah but what 's happening there ok so the comments that came back said that the policy that we originally put in for Princess Margaret about doing comprehensive development when they finished using the site as hospital they said that wasn 't appropriate to have there and that the hospital zone should only have objectives and policies relating to the functioning and use of the site for Hospital activities not for when the hospital ceases to exist so they propose that we just used the same process as we 've used with that if they 're not going to use it as a hospital they can use it as whatever the underlying zone is so the underlying zone so we 've gone with that but what one change that we have done is the underlying zone was originally residential suburban we 've now put it down as residential suburban density transition just to kind of direct the fact that we know the site is capable of a lot more than residential suburban and ideally it would be residential medium density but we we just can 't go that far and one jump so if if the developers when they come in for the site want to do that and they can come in for a consent and go that way and the other thing maybe to signal is that I know from the discussions going on in the residential phase one there 's a brownfield site policy that they 're working through at the moment and that may well offer them some scope to go through that way and do some kind of comprehensive development hmm so but in terms of this and just rely on the underlining zone is that would create you think not controversy but would cause concern to communities as hospitals were going in their neighborhoods now it 's basically as is at the moment it 's only the sites that are hospitals and it 's the fact that if the hospitals on those existing sites are discontinued they can go to do residential and that 's what it is at the moment alright that 's all good thank you commercial and industrial commercial and industrial starts on page 161 the Western usher is here went there just apologies we make Stevenson he 's tied up in a pre-hearing conference I could provoke cover off these things in l a-- methesse and much more i fail with some of these things to me were no doubt step in if I get myself into a bit of strife but there are a number of recommendations that the minister put back to us and they 'll are dealt with us follows the first one is about resource efficiency provisions so the we 're basically agree with the minister there because stage one as well and the hearings that will start on May the illimitable think it is we recommended to take those resource efficiency provisions out which is really consistent with the approach to take another chapters so it 's not a resource efficiency is not a resource management issue it certainly is but there are better ways of under the circumstances are dealing with it it 's an in relation to the statement of expectations that they 're being taken out that I mean this is something that councillors feel quite strongly about because you know everywhere we have you know dealt with the issues of the rebuild everyone says why don 't we use this as an opportunity to build back better a sustainability district energy schemes the the whole nine yards you know I mean that you know this building itself is going to be the basis for a district energy scheme you know it 's a fantastic opportunity to actually get better resource use and actually a more sustainable environment for for for for us and and you know an exemplar status I think for the take these provisions are out you know and I understand that you 've got you know the the strategic directions but i think that there 's this there 's been a kind of a fundamental error and judging whether whether whether costs in the benefits lie so yeah sure the developer might face the costs of putting in these energy provisions energy savings provisions and the benefits flow to the future user so there 's a disconnect between who benefits but the point is is that the developers going to recover the cost anyway from the either the first buyer and the benefits will flow on through the term of the or the life of the building and this is the thing that I cannot get my head around why on earth you know that you know people the users the owners of the houses the owners of the commercial buildings why you thought they being seen as the beneficiaries of this instead of this focus on the cost to the developer instead of the lifetime cost to those who use this use the facilities I i think it 's at the front end and have it as a requirement of the rebuilt I mean it just doesn 't make sense to me you have decided and stage 2 with respect to residential to keep the similar type rules and again right you know and we know that we have to protect you as staff from the from from the inevitable result of putting up a proposal that doesn 't necessarily align what the approach that the hearings panel have already taken but i would i would much rather that we put it up and and and and and invited the people of Christchurch to actually submit on it because I think you know that the end canon hearings panel does need to hear what we are hearing and we do need to encourage you know sort of residents and citizens of christchurch to be submitting on what on the kind of city they want to rebuild this is this is a chance in a lifetime we 'll never get this chance again they 've already indicated it through sheer an idea we 've got to put it at practice would need to indicate under commercial and industrial recommendations 137 recommendation 3 8 to retain the resource efficiency rules yep so to retain really retain not change yep yep yep oh yeah ok well I 'll move that and yanni sick in the stitch so I 'll just put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place I know that 's carried right right yes is there anything else in that chapter there are a few things if you don 't mind if we can go through them yes recommend a recommendation 138 new bright commercial area again the the ministers really wanting us to reduce the river design and put into into these suburban centers the recommendation is to that no changes are recommended that we and the region response to the minister 's comments and the phase two provisions proposed new bright to be subject to the same move and design thresholds as other centers and subject to the suburban master plans so basically then they will be considered by the hearing spend anyway in stage one so there is that there is a on stage one whether the younger run was staged with new brighton are not so much will keep them in and yawns we go I agree with that I think it 's really important I mean we 're going to be considering the establishment of you know a Development Authority it 's got to have this focus on suburban development as well and the idea that you brighten could be a bit of an exemplar for the city and that process I think as requires us to keep the Sun so it to me it 's a it 's absolutely imperative that we do but that 's your recommendation and I suppose I should look to the counselor for the area I did different few last time but things have changed i think between their and their own yeah yeah so you want to keep in the the the provisions around urban design and the master plans yep yep all right yep recommendation 139 this is to do with making the firefighting permitted activity and so that 's fine we agree with the minister 's comments their recommendation 14 resource the sorry 140 guys are some 139 in your comments you 've got stage one ccc officer evidence and you 've got exemptions from street scene and landscaping rules for emergency services facilities is that is that already been done as part of chapter 1 or stage one yes we can discuss that no well this well I mean that 's just much less a supporting why this resolution is as it is there 's the recommendation okay so if you live next to light the beacon and place will sit in police station which it isn 't probably the best design thing but the relationship of the straight i woulda thought was pretty important where are you talking about firefighting here right I 'm happy with the firefighting staff but I don 't want this to be seen as kind of you know if people are having emergency services next to their houses and I think of st. John 's that have a number and residential areas that we wouldn 't have some sort of expectation of you know landscaping or street or immunity from the street here so it don 't have to deal with the unintended consequences well I mean I 'm just trying to think of the emergency services amelie overlay the fire station for example I 'm thinking of the one and sprayed it that 's built right up the street is it 's not it 's not practical to have landscaping really there and foreigners come out I mean they 've got to have easy access and egress out of the place so you 're not going to get too much of a street scene enhancement it 's probably more the side boundaries with the neighbors which are more important in those are covered and it 's like well I 've got nothing then here said they 're not I would have thought for example you might have some screening at the back if you take me i 'll come oxford terrace you know having barbed wire fences facing into a residential neighborhood not particularly attractive no no reason you couldn 't have trees are the vectors screener when I was i 'm basically looking at there 's any exemptions from the street scene that 's my understanding of this yeah that 's my understand again yep carry on okay so one for one remove the industrial parks over more 11 you or 140 the resource efficiency that 's the same as 137 so that that recommendation has proved 13 see the 14 sorry and we need to go back then and change this recommendation because you agreed to keeping in the energy efficiency rules on page 161 we need to go back and recommendation to retain them here Oh in such regions so recommendation 1 43 and eight so can you just add them to yes you could just just put and so so just add the numbers 140 and you 've got three and eight there three and eight is it still as it 's three and eight yes three and eight or two and eight it says three recommendation 3 on page 164 yeah but the other one was too yeah so oh no I beg your pardon though it is it 's just three and a touch I get it too there should be a to know and I okay 's right so it 's 130 and 140 three and age yep yeah it should be energy and efficiency rules energy and efficiency rules well it resource efficiency you it 's good OIC 141 yep 141 141 the this concerns the mail site look up quarter ma 'am or 11 you on Russell erode the the minister has basically submitted that we should remove our proposed industrial park zone and rely on a plane change that was submitted officers don 't agree with that approach for a number of reasons but basically because by putting our own zone and it gives us more scope otherwise we 're limited lodging submissions on that particular plan change and but we have made it we have item yes nations yes that we belong we believe that the plan check that the zone lipid and perhaps a better outcome than the plan change I guess that 's it but but if the hearings panel just say we 've got we 've got the plan change what why would we put it on ozone well simply because the plan change that was lodged has different and it doesn 't make any difference well but there any difference is that we 're minister saying is that submitters death to submit both on the plan change on an hour proposal that 's right let us know but that 's not unusual and planning terms I mean that what will happen is that the presumably they 're independent hearings pattern will hear that the two together and if people are going to make submissions twice for that again it 's not unusual for that to happen there is the intention for the hearings panel to hear this zone and the plan change together should we should we continue with this recommendation but are they just going to give us a week for putting on a plan chain I mean are putting in our own zone change while the plan changes in there well I don 't see why they should it is all because it 's it 's we 've got the council has its entitlement under the process to zone that do a resume all this Minister has asked us to take it out so I just to get a slap down for putting on our own process which is over and above that which has been submitting proposed through the plan change _"

    "text": "go okay all right reconvene the meeting and I 'm just yeah it does raise some issues about the the quantity of material that people are carrying between meetings so Brigitte 's already just raised with staff about having some storage capacity out the back here for these kinds of meetings where where significant documents are required I think the bulk of the the boxed material is for Friday rather than today but yeah I 've just see that that pips could have been made a little bit clearer but anyway look I 'm terribly sorry Ellie and I no no no it 's not your fault it 's just a genuine accident but it does raise health and safety concerns which we at the council should be you know promoting best practice and well we did we wait but it actually is I mean that 's a well I 'm a knock anyway I bit the issue isn 't going to go away because I 'm going to talk to whoever it is within the council about about whether it 's whether we can actually do a little bit issues so anyway moving along we are back to Riccarton racecourse out yeah just what I mean just to summarize we were up to so the proposal was to go ahead with the with the classification of right residential suburban no residential new sorry what does that residential neighborhood residential new neighbor also recommended that 's the officers recommendation the crown and consultation with the developer nataar who is talking about residential suburban des ents density transition zone Riccarton racecourse density overlay and open spaces metropolitan facilities record on race course zone and I think we got to as that that the choice is between a proposal that has an an ODP an outline development plan of this correct and within the context of an outline development plan the wider community 's concerns and issues can be more readily addressed and the problem with the other zone is is that it 's strictly down to the subdivision rules ones more flexible and more interactive and the other is more inflexible and not zones welders own specific which creates another overlay and complexity within the plan is it a fair summaries questions and then yarny and then Phil what I 'm really keen to avoid as an Aidan field concept so that 's my sort of benchmark of what I never want to have anybody ever achieve again and so how do we best make sure that there are some community spaces and facilities with they don 't have to be shops they can be anything within the Riccarton racecourse new development in most instances it 's developed a lead and they will demonstrate commercial viability for spaces although the council when it comes to reserve lead that is out what we would accept is reserved contribution that is where we have I suppose the greatest influence and power to ensure that there 's adequate spaces community spaces they can be designed so we can have important normally we 're working closely with the developers to come up with an agreed approach to the lean juice development so again it 's through that process that we do it in much green spaces around this particular one for something that was a community facility that wasn 't a green space no no to do in most cases the council 's done a sort of a level of planning for the area itself so all our green Ford areas because we did our area plans we actually knew what we needed in those areas we 've identified there so it really was just getting down to the detail of where exactly and what it would be designed and you know we do that through you know different consenting processes in this case I 'm not really aware yet what community facilities spaces mizzou 's that we need I would need to come back to you about what we council officers across the council considers needed and then would have to use that and I suppose try and work with the developer to see that achieved okay now that can probably be provided for as a permitted activity there is a neat chorley neighborhood rules work permit quickly I think it was an apt of 50 or 40 square meters public open spaces are permitted activity it had some controls so just sorry I 'm just having to find well so you can do but is there a difference between the two types of plan because we 've got two choices we 've got an a new neighborhoods with an ODP and we 've got a blah blah blah record on over ladies so which one is more likely to lead to a positive resolution in that regard the outline development plan process right as where we identify those locals so that we can 't require it we well we could we could prepare it we could go away do some work yourself about the key what you call structuring elements or key principles for the area we can go away we can prepare our own outline development plan based on the information that we know no we don 't want to do that we wanted we liberally with them but we can 't legally require them to do that so what is but it is it is true that outline development plan process is what I 'm hearing you say is the best mechanism for achieving what we want to achieve which is a neighborhood not just a suburb it 's the master structure planning exercise right and that 's where you do that you can do it i 'm not saying that you you know we could still submit if the hearings panel preferred the suburban density so we can still I suppose make a submission and even that some of the land zoned local center yeah we can still do the idea it 's the only through evidence we would I think that there is the indication that you 're getting from us because we we don 't kind of you know we 're very aware that it 's the independent hearings panel that will make a decision and it 's kind of like we want to make sure that and I look I know that you know because I dealt with nitre who how they got to this ridiculous you know state and tomorrow park that I know that as an organization as a developer they 're very keen to make sure that they 've got local facilities but they 're also a business you know so they will be looking for the business case around around these things so collaborative way to get an outcome that works for everyone because the last thing that we want to do is to create okay so Vicky 's called it here Aiden field and I don 't want I don 't want another tomorrow park I want us to have neighborhoods where people have the opportunity to connect and actually it doesn 't matter what it is that they 're connecting over it 's just the connections that make them great places to love yani since Susan made inherent problem is that we keep talking about working with developers Sarah 's consulting with the developers working with the developers but who is working with the community and what stage to the community gets see what is the new neighborhood that 's been built and their front yard all their back yard and how it relates to how they currently love because I 'm really concerned that everything we 've heard there 's a process without clarity without opportunity for those residents but we 've already agreed to set up the zone we 've already agreed that what we 're discussing now is notify the one recommended by the ministers so I 'm sorry when you say we 've already agreed so as part of stage one we resigned this into stage two so we 're here emigrate to say that we 're responding to the minister 's colleen 's yes but we 've already agreed and the motive to notify the rezoning of this we did that we have before it went to the ministers know so what happened does we do a draft it goes to Minister for comment that 's right we 're told that there 's no consultation with the community we can 't talk to community boards but then we hear that series been talking to the developer and we 've just been given the extract from those discussions and now we 're saying we 're going to respond to that no jaani jaani we already decided when we sent the the material often ministers that we would notify this change fun it 's not it 's not so your issue only for this meeting is what we actually notify by way of the two options the one that the ministers have referred back to us which one is a very high level they haven 't talked about just quite the page they have for about a very high level feedback about how we support certain things in terms of simplicity clarity certainty rah rah rah so what is why i prefer what we notified to be what we notify what we sent to the ministers i prefer that option okay so can I just ask them in terms of the density that Sarah are proposing meter squares as a minimum minimum and at night it 's my Tahoe Sierra night I have worked together to put forward some draft and run rules for discussion and then 10 meter wide year so there 's small size so potentially as a minimum site you know 250 sq meters is probably getting more akin to residential medium density it 's gig very small side so but I suppose in their approach what they 're they 're trying to get greater variance within the residential density transition zone I think the issue that you 're raising in terms of community involvement to making a submission through the stage to process if they don 't see something that they 're happy worth then they need to make a submission on it and we had we agreed that we didn 't have time to go out and consult on what we notified to the ministers because if we did that the numbers of people who 've come here and stage one who think that influencing our decision influences the final result in a does hunt and we agreed as a council that we wouldn 't our community through that that we would have one process where they could submit to the to the independent hearings panel once we 've notified so the question for us today is simply what are we notifying on this occasion we will certainly be talking to our communities and I know that Jimmy and Vicki will be absolutely talking to their local community about submitting on the sochi airy and we will be providing background material to support them during that you know in the community board as well this is where the community board actually gets to and as I 've said I will be writing to the independent hearings panel and making it crystal clear that the community boards are not representing that council they are representing their communities when they submit today that we 've currently got 250 square meters meter squared now in residential as suburban it is density transition 330 meters squared right and the Sarah proposal it 's 250 meter squeeze I see here that has things like so enjoy the minimum dimension of 10 x 16 so that 's in the subdivision that 's to make sure you have a workable site put a household so so it 's Alisa what 's the minimum minimum minimum household unit size 60 square meters oh well you 're looking at different depends but housing typology you 're proposing would you know I 'm determinist in the worst-case scenario well it may not be a worst-case scenario some people like living in town houses that 's when I spent most of my youth living in town houses you know and it 's just crazy to think this is what the district plan should be be such an auntie developer sentiment around here which it is I 'm it 's always developed who builds these places I mean who builds the developers build up until we have the government building them or community housing associations building so we rely on developers I like the idea of Community Housing Association pal sector and it would be good if we could all get around that idea but we rely on we 're allowing developers to build stuff so that people can live in them yeah but and then and then when when they have a plan the community then can say actually you know we 've got certain issues with this buddy i did this amorphous blob of the community i think it needs to be dispelled yeah but them r my thing from the experience that we 're going through here and it is the case on a number of chapters as the experience we 're going through is is that we all know examples of where it 's been an utter disaster and what we 're trying to do is to future-proof so that in 've had in the past everyone agrees Aiden field was a disaster and yes it involved a developer but it didn 't it didn 't actually involve anyone that was interested and that the broader concept of what makes a neighborhood as opposed to a suburb I mean just don 't know that people really get the importance of what we 're doing here but we 're side trekking on to a range of issues that issue comes down to which of the two do we notify Phil thank you because I think we need a speaking sort of order I 've been not going to speak for a bit odd my my question really around the notarial proposal was worth the with the UM higher density in a smaller minimum size sections does that mean and in fact there 's more better potential for more affordable housing with their proposal its effects the exemplar yeah part of the minister 's announcement at riccarton was that a chunk of this would be affordable housing I think the third if I 'm not certain at what how this has been presented 's what the minister said at riccarton was the record to my sport race course people and their night out who people that big chunk of this would be affordable housing to really was around what I understood for the exemplar planning and that one of the reasons it didn 't achieve that you you 'll know is that was traffic issues and like clearly that was one of them wasn 't it well for affordability and but also traffic issues was another one and just seemed to me that you know a real problem was more intensive housing is that am i right that would be greater and more significant traffic compete it 's smaller well I mean Trevor defeats give doubt were through before again through the outline development planning process it gets dealt with through the subdivision consenting process if they need to do any upgrades to intersections that 's with maybe a condition of subdivision consent and lenders consent again you know our typical approach to greenfield development or large development of sites is to identify those meters early in the process it mean in terms does is one contributor to housing affordability but it is not by no means the I suppose king-hit to make something affordable it 's here what we 're trying to seek for in this side is variable density across the site so we 're trying to allow greater flexibility so the officers we just feel that the residential your neighborhood rules will provide you know greater flexibility for for the developers and you know that 's what we 're trying to facilitate we 're trying to facilitate a lot of outcomes for this lead so what are the beasts own provisions to do that and we think on balance the reason it renew neighborhoods out there thinks he and the other thing too used to Volusion to this unrest from Vickie 's comments it so the concepts or now of achieving exemple status that kind of us could have been put aside is it the exemplar hearings were held last year late last year and the decision has been released so this this housing proposal might seek to do affordable housing but it 's not going to reach exemplary status that opportunity yeah all right so I know I I don 't think that there 's any disowned there 's no reason to have any more questions because I mean I just can 't see the point of it so I just think it 's probably better to ask whether we have agreement to pursue the existing notification provision so do we have agreement on that matter right the best we can see the officers recommendation for is Aditya clear open space okay so open space starts at 147 _"

think our Tia and horse will waste that 's right they come up sorry so you you 're not going pass tonight ok now I 'm just going through the document and order very I hid them in the previous chapter ok let 's cool yep is there any any other issue so that 's a tick on that page 93 that 's all so moving on to now residential the Riccarton racecourse and there is a proposal attached to the additional sheet that you got the short one there was a meth on the bay I may not have brought it with me it 's one of the pages i didn 't bring items bring the box oh right yes I 've got the picture you 've got the pitch there 's ways to go with it too how many people haven 't_''_102.46 bought this because perhaps I should get it copied the next okay go into the next one get copies for everyone here you go back you can have your pick okay so going on to our tier then on mm-hmm no it 's here page 115 there is some possible agreement or not to relocate the cat club up to a quarry which hasn 't it start to be dug McLain 's island so what are we actually approving of the our tier development and I see earlier on the skin there 's a proposal for affordability out there but I think that 's been taken care of under the loop so yes I have a picture of our the Aldea the envy or the housing again how close are we going to them okay so it 's right one part of it is right meets toward the cat club so so part of the housing a cord site yet which I understand is there is soon to be a resource consent or they may be even like already lodged and to develop the site and part of it certainly the south side of the motorway that area would can come up with some right you know amazing solution to deal with the cat club noise whilst that still remains like a residential develop year there is an inch of development couldn 't occur but could it be built you might be able to conceit energy do something that 's fun so we 're not approving any development near this noise area and lease that has been relocated and this is or at least they can demonstrate or provide and totally mitigated this it 's okay it 's fun thank you alright better check open space and it was erasing it no no it was cause we 'll West I think that 's right yeah sorry it wasn 't written down sorry that wasn 't written down and for small waist was always that 's the fulton hogan development and hotel junction road and that was the that got rezone door part of it got Ruiz owned under state won the remainder was proposed to be at one point and the version of the Living G which we called residential established your neighborhoods but as I advise last week just carry through residential new neighborhoods will use that for the risk of the Living G signs halls will whisk however there has been as quite advanced it 's just about completed all subdivision consents of being granted for it and so we have great certainty about the pattern of development so we 're proposing and with support from fulton hogan then the whole of the site they 've resigned a mixed of residential suburban and residential meeting density okay right i want to so we 'll go back to rotten racecourse so Wrexham racecourse and the key point here i supposes about thirty eight hectares of land and as of last week we received a proposal to rezone that residential suburban density transition zone subject to some new provisions that would provide for a higher density within that zone of 250 square meters for a minimum site sighs so there 's two options to way to deal with the studio tds one is to zone it the as the Sierra has proposed is too and I think it 's in be as well to propose all night sorry night forward some a recommended approach where you insert some new provisions as I said to provide for some higher density than what is provided for in the residential suburban density transition zone council officers still think that the more appropriate way would be to mean that has meerut not saying that does not have merit and that would deliver some of their outcomes but the benefit of Zone in it which we think is residential neighborhoods which typically comes with which comes with an outline development plan is that you get more of a comprehensive approach to it there 's also great flexibility and you know I still will note that the residential new neighborhood rules the store being decided by the hearings panel so not quite sure well inform they 'll comin but that zone we officers still feel that would be more appropriate for this 38 years if it was a smaller land area you know under 10 heat is we might see that you know it would have more merit or residential suburban density transition zone will be more appropriate but in this case it 's just a need for an outlined development plan for the area and you know we do think there 's great enough flexibility for them to achieve their variable density within the new neighborhood rule so that those are the two options they both work we just think the one has a slight advantage sites like this or anything of the direction that we 've already received really from the independent hearings panel which would suggest the preference over what you 're recommending because that 's the way i read the advice not not i mean as i said right at this moment literally this week that resident those residential new neighborhood sewing rules have been just you know considered by the hearings panel and you know i mean this can just all be resolved through submission process and through mediation so safe wiki this is creating another overlay on a policy right right and the way that i read the independent hearings panel sort of advice on strategic directions was that they didn 't want to have overlays and multiple different classifications quite right so yeah yeah and and it 's 's a Riccarton racecourse overlay which i can understand why people want their own special set of rules but you know if that can be catered for and the concept of the ODP that would be required under the residential new neighborhood so it seems to me that it 's more in line with what the independent hearings panel ISM as leaning towards rather than a specific one off case for record on race yeah officers comics we 've highlighted that as well I mean overlays are just getting incredibly complex I mean there 's so many of them yeah so to reduce complexity it 's simpler to just sign at residential neighborhoods well that 's my preference I mean the point is is that that enables people to argue the toss so if the independent hearings panel wants to you know introduce that layer of complexity then so be it but I think we should be promoting the idea of simplicity and and and unless overlays rather than more that 's my view yeah I think so yeah so am i miss anyone 's got an alternative point of of the party owner in the residence of the stamen street and also your the area around the 200 people they have a rest this kind of issue to the erect member i was in there late too late we do to attend another the outer the long term printed publication meeting because they put you concerned need no matter what kinda over the case and they would like to have a pavan notified because they put you consume the area because current is kind of the base under the resurrector HR is not now yet any subdivision arrest any to going on to the Parliament the bill is passes in otherwise their concerns are trans transporter issue and the school kids the kind of the teaching the safety issue a sexually so I 'm wondering so if I based on this civil cases is only exemplar or change the Toleration of the west coast resort actor or theater or msn so I 'm not sure you know which one can go to the public notification all right well mark neither of the proposed zones for wrexham racecourse would result development all effects can be addressed through the rules within the zone at either zone whatever approach but in this case of the recommendation is residential neighborhoods then it can be dealt with it is not the intent and we would not want a nearly way to frustrate development of this land and in terms of any roading effects well that 's something council can look at but you know generally safety improvements will that is reviewed annually and if there are concerns and and they 've been assessed as real concerns then that that 's a measure for a different process to resolve road safety concerns but I mean we we don 't want to result of notification of this land and frustrate development but in your toast road in terms of the processes because I 've got John to our knees for me because I couldn 't be at the meeting either as I understand it from their point of view to address what they see as the impact on transport particularly around the edges of quite a major new residential subdivision they actually need to go to that 's the benefit of doing of undertaking an outline development plan I mean they still have not prepared an hour on development plan so we would we would be hoping that through submission and mediation we 're going to be working with them and that will you know appear and you can look at lowes meters so can I just ask one question in terms of the outline development plan for the entire area because it 's quite a large area and an intensity residential part of the city are their requirements for places where the community comes together like shops or is there some creative collision use the Vita 's where you the outline development plan process is where you resolve those matters and in normally they 're always done in consultation with the community as well in this case it will be quite fast traitor and the difficulty will be that fact that at time of notification we won 't have an outline development plan to notify so there 's two you know we hope that through some missions an outline development plan is put in place panel will go with the ministerial advice which is to go with the other zone which doesn 't require that one develops right so them in that that 's that 's the issue and and then it 's really very much lifting your subdivision consent process to resolve any of those issues and that is where you get down to the detail division consent process because putting these weekend so yeah and we will reserve well that 's the point for the subdivision casino officers to work with them on where the Brazilian would be where the you know any setbacks from I think it 's a waterway through there in eroding layout so yes but there is any like well in terms of local centers then you 're talking about that would have to come though probably would need to seek out through the rezoning of a pocket of land if they wanted to put some shots in there because we have just a similar to greenfield areas well it 's pretty very similar to a green field area and once they 've identified the spatial dimensions of a that we would make that easy wouldn 't_''_938.259 we wait of course of you but no because I mean I know the history of tomorrow park and there 's nothing in there just zip not one ireen not nothing you know you have to walk you have to give me a car to get a paper on a Sunday you don 't have and alert and I know it 's just as nice but anybody that it 's the same developer and it as a end it was a set of rules that they came up against in intransigence that and that meant that the small group of shops that they had and their plan just didn 't proceed they just gave up so that 's what so I mean I know the history of it because I used to be the MP for the area and I wasn 't the MP at the time the development when turned but I knew straight away what the impact of not having any local facilities was for such a mess of development yes and again I come back to this is where and then you need to follow through and end rezone I mean the council itself if it I don 't know what the retail assistants have been in this area but local the thing with local shops they don 't typically they don 't have retail distribution of X so we don 't actively go out and put them in place it 's not to say that council can 't signal you know a strongly advise a need for a local center and a few shots but the other thing about this is a lot of the area 's the it 's the market that needs to drive the need or and eventually the developers come I know this is like I mean sorry we were at a meeting last night listening to what makes a city happy and and actually bumping spaces walking distance they 're all about what makes people not only happy but healthy resilient the environment more sustainable I mean there 's just everything goes in favour of heaven yet local yeah I mean at some point we can come back with some more advice from more closely and he can sort of advisor we are very act with a detailed planning of the year I 'm desperate to avoid here because it is potentially a really cool development but can we just adjourn the meeting from an up please _"

    "text": "thank you mix black moving on to signs page 50 was it okay for hang on yannis not here so we 'll just can we defer that one 's okay subdivision subdivision develop subdivisions about mental earthquakes noise just before that Oh noise sorry sorry i take x if I got through it yeah and we don 't have our boys expert today but my past John Alps of our from our environment our environmental health yep what page we on 57 56 so where did we stop the last time I 'll 50 semen so they the question the issue relating to littleton and putting in a more restrictive rule via yes that 's right because I all Android raised us that 's right Andrews not here today but that 's yes i think is he good with us now or all of them to give that no no little terns always had a different rule everyone else and there 's no running basically this is bringing it into line with the rest yes but andrew as i recall raised a concern yes about the then the restrictive nature solving a problem that wasn 't apparently a problem at the stage and that is exactly it it 's not a problem at this stage we are looking forward it 's simply putting in about some braces approach but we 're in your hands as to which way you 'd like to deal with it here we can put them all in Littleton but and then close and then close the tunnel no just joking no would so I think that I think that issue is that is a standardized response required for a little Sun compared with other parts of the city and that I don 't know the the issue with little Turner 's not so much that the levels in the town center but the proximity of the residential and also the elevation of the residential above the town center so there 's a potential there if the levels are too high to cause a considerable amount of nuisance in issues for the residential have had an example of that occurring the year with a resident who 's not actually in close proximity but he 's in base from one of the bars there so the idea with us is to control the noise in the town center with it which will also help assist keeping the amenity in the residential areas right so as this after ten o 'clock at night it 's the the old standard was basically 65 anytime yeah in a town center and in the resident but it 's generally controlled by the residential levels which are forty eight nights of our 13 o 'clock right so measurements we 've taken in the town seen it would indicate they would comply certainly with the 55-day time yeah it may be a little bit of a challenge for 45 at night but it 's with the right design of the premises there and they certainly opportunity with a lot of new buildings going in there to do that they 're going to affect current premises they 're like wunderbar or places is that the sort of place you 're talking about yeah yes the men they 've had done done quite a lot of work to ensure they currently meet the standard the I 'm not going to about that enclosed proximity to the bar I mean this place has been there for years I mean yes you know port town is I used to live here you know it 's just actually yeah it down there at night yeah no no you know i mean i know that worried about very wary at the town it 's a port town it 's lively I 'm not kids families yeah I ya know I completely I completely understand it but i 'm not sure what the local viewers i 'm assuming that they would want some protection from noise but the thing is is that i mean III think that probably the solution is to notify this but also encourage council tuna to talk to the locals to submit on it because if the submissions from the locals are overwhelmingly we just don 't want to go there then you know then there may be the independent hearings panel would be interested in hearing that oh and i just i just think that if I were if we were the decision makers I could let us know what they think about that because if you don 't notify anything and people won 't put up apropos you know I won 't put up the alternative that 's right this can be tested through the submissions process alright so and and and okay so um I think we should we should move well well I don 't think we need to move that will just take this one off but if if you could yeah if you could just prepare a note for me to refute a counselor tuna because i think as part of the our communication generally about the whole notification process we could do a little to section saying these are the sorts of issues you might like to raise and we could do that in consultation with counselor Turner and maybe the community board as well yes they 'll be great thank you right next one subdivision development on earth works no there are more noise wants to go through all the do you want to said oh sorry yeah we only got a thanks to the first ok so straightforward but oh I see we just haven 't took them off no yep yep in christchurch stadium what thats well it 's the it 's the it 's the temporary facility is not that you 're apparently this well basically that they 're saying that because it 's going to be there longer then we need to extend the noise provisions is that all right I 've meet a few people on the left this morning that went to the concert last night Ricky Martin yeah they 're all giggling away yep right ya know so I mean for games end for concerts it does need that to be recognized that it 's extended so what 's the next books recommendation theatre recommendation do th-16 yep military and emergency more firearms year and then we 've got 31 31 helicopters without tool and yes I family are their recommendation is that it yep no time 30 to six to the Visionaire infrastructure and crush it cheer port yep and the next one 73 33 34 35 any six and that 's a thirty-six yep that 's a tuck no to subdivision development and earthworks page 70 page 17 right Oh big pardon Oh away from you he 's sorry here are cool of amendments here in relation to the agent testing yeah went through the minister didn 't comment on ministers some people didn 't comment on these new rules but these are as a resolution to create some errors there was actually a gap and one of the policies with regard to putting in the 55 DB LD inline-four engine testing noise contour hits and regard to noise insulation being required within that area so it 's just adding those extra words and to reflect what we 've already gotten the rest of that chapter you pardon well it 's just tying up with the fact that we 've already got a proposed rule requiring acoustic insulation within the 55 engine testing contour that 's largely within the 55 airport noise contour but these are bold where it actually extends out so this is an extra area that would need to be acoustic because it insulated the bowl just sort of at the end of here wood road yep site yep all right do you need a motion for those papers yes please yes I 'll move there seconded by Vicki back i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried good that 's fine thank you thank you right a subdivision development and ethics that we we 've just not dealt with the whole of it that 's correct right okay so let 's go through this the first one recommendation 37 now without the big picture oh okay well isn 't there one that that that has exercised us in terms of the recommendation versus what we want food are you wanting a description of what this chapter does yeah just basically oh hey Simmons me just two minutes on your big picture so I said this is stage two of the subdivision chapter so that was already a subdivision chapter and that dealt with priority residential zones commercial zone and industrial zones that included all of the general servicing and transport things this stage to really just fills in all the other zones and so will now come into here and the other other addition is in relation to natural and cultural heritage there 's a few rules around there that are coming from stage to mature eight point three point eight yeah there is an earthwork section in here as well and it deals it 's a bit complicated it deals with m.phil of quarries in some instances so we 've hit to revise the bits and pieces between rural chapter and the earthworks section of this chapter ok so the own part of queries dealt with in this chapter is the end filling of the quarry 's post thee yeah you know after they 've taken everything out they then call them in and have we put walls that are enforceable about what is allowed to go back into that space and we can 't come to them later on and back okay so that 's not in this chapter it isn 't as children it 's like a subdivision development in earthworks we 're about 70 so so raising you know the minister 's comments on that chapter you have actually received the understand that but my reading about the recommendations is that is that in this area there is nothing other then the quarry 's a man form the location gradient and deep the quarry pack that 's it it is a check as it recommendations 45 that we 're referring to that 's the only one that seems to have anything is yes of substance yeah respecto really the what the minister was raising is it was some overlap between the Royal chapter and the earthworks chapter there shouldn 't have been so it 's just taking that out so most of this is just not niceties fairly straightforward terms of support for his ground there is nothing about that what goes in there and um back into the quarry yeah and there 's an existing rule in their accession it deals with content of Phil right and I need to comply with that but we 've already notified that but it 's it 's within stage two and there are no comments on that from the minister right so we 've already got that and the thing that we 've it 's already Errol no it 's an it what 's in both chapters it 's okay yeah crap in terms of the fill is very good monitoring system because obviously they can dump whatever they like without your know we 're nobodies and that 's probably more the concern than the digging out oh yeah the monitoring probably is somewhat of an issue and it 's certainly not something that we can write a role on the district plan to say you have to be there and monitor it I guess it 's more something that if there was an issue that we could go back and he 's real he 's leaving a responsible for monitoring the lane thorac and yeah I think it would be as if we 've got rules ner district plane and we need to be monitoring and enforcing those I mean we should have rules around the fill and it should be done in a certain way otherwise it just becomes a potential rubbish tip I mean that 's how they have feigned on its how BIG 's they got created and it Lawson well we 're living so that part was develop was that a walker pit there should be some kind of inspection before land gets filled back up I mean because you 're going to have some good operators and then you have some less good ones we don 't really care but the district plane has the rules it 's not the enforcement occur so but I think that what counselors are saying is is that they want to have an idea of the enforcement regime so that they can you know really understand how this is going to be meaningfully and false because we all now know examples of where the failure of enforcement it 's not so much the rules it 's the failure of force now it should be a cost so that the cost of a permit to quarry should price in the fact that there are extra costs in actually enforce I monitoring what goes back into the film relatively low so most ball refilling of quarries will require consent so you have the enforcement three times I 've consumed yeah that 's it going to cory 's are the air yeah what are they actually allowed to fill quarry 's worth under our current scheme under the current plan essentially the same content of filled provisions have been carried over clean fill it as clean fell wasn 't the info meaning fill them is clean anything is not a few traceable or rotten or rubbish essentially so it includes kenta concrete rubble from demolition for example but shouldn 't include timber the rule doesn 't require it to be tested but is but is that the rule or the consent provisions well not all of them will be consented itself it 's a real quarry so I mean the name there may not be that can sing for that I think we need I think we need an overarching report on the whole process from whoa to go just just for our sake so because up that we don 't we can 't see where the gapers all we can see is that there is a problem in others in my view a little ticking time bomb for for the city maybe a representing the enforcement arm of counsel to this meeting no I think a written report would be easier for us to digest a short written report on the start to flush of quarrying and filling so that we can and then and then I think we could have a meeting around you know having the different the different arms here to go through it but I mean we 're not going to do it on the time frame for we notify but i have to say that this worries me because if we do lose the argument on the exposure of our land exposure of our multiple exposures of our groundwater it 's actually the film then fills me with trepidation about what that could potentially do as well okay what i 'd like to try and bring that back to you and before the second of May so that this is included in this round of notifications okay in a no i 'm not i 'm not saying to hold this up i thought that this is this I can 't see that this chapter because I mean what passed the through these the chapters yes you know so but but I know that council around the table this is this is causing enormous anxiety Alan amongst various parts of our community and we want to make sure that we 've got a very clear understanding of start to finish quarrying too real and scaped environment and he 'll just seemed to me that because of the complex and my understanding is that he can are involved with the monetary enforcement to answers at mb or but that in fact somebody besides the short report someone to speak to it would perhaps oh yeah as buyers we want both so we want a Briton report and we want but it may involve weekend as well because they will be part of their they are responsible for monitoring the groundwater and can I just check that you 're okay that that happens after the second of May and that this rule stays in there well I 'm would you try would you like us to try and achieve their but it would have to be does weeks tweak yeah around to hold this up for notification can 't right and that 's fine but what 's going in there is not just clean fool that can trot so it 's probably more the enforcement I small the enforcement side which it 's not a district plan met yeah so okay we 're here I come back with you after the sick I can yeah thank you yeah Phil is a another question relation of us it moved it discussed it before and I 'm referring to okay across my mode after we raise questions about the depth of the quarrying and the impact on the echo far in the water so it 's around actually the same area the uterus Road area where there 's a proposal for to have a football sports complex I 'm just there so when they make when they make application does that application fit this section hitless chapter here in terms of requirements in for it works they probably would require consumed in in them year so I 'm just that 's another example to me of where they 'll be clearly there 's I 'll be no in fact is there is there playing sufficient to actually you keep echo for safe yes it is said that the volumes in the earthquake section of a fairly low so that we do catch these applications so there would be a resource consent and it would be appropriate conditions put on there yep and those sound eerie is called querying when the quarry stuff has been depleted and it 's been n filled with apparently clean stuff what do those what can those spaces then be used for yes so that I guess once you come to do another land use on top of that you need to i guess if it was a building where i asked that there are requirements under the building code in terms of foundations and the ground underneath there and there 's also the nes fun contaminated land so if it had been contaminated you would have to comply with the rules with the net as well if it had been contaminated of you probably do some soil testing there are triggers arminius that would in some instance require belly consent for a building anyway stability of the ground but I guess is the same as any property I mean I don 't know if my property has contaminated or not what I don 't see what the difference is if you wanted to be sure about contamination you would need to get somebody to test in fact so just in terms of what you can do sorry fell on those so quarry zones but big chunk of land you finished querying what can you then do never mind about the contamination what are you allowed to build and haven 't had enough to do with the real corazon to know what other activities are permitted presumably as they continuously deplete the aggregate then the land use will change quite yeah you 're right I just don 't know what that chapter has s permitted activities does anyone and I don 't_''_1414.339 off the top of my head I can bring our dell here if you like it just at some stage it would be really good to know because looking forward it obviously has a big impact on plan change if all of that quarrying were the Lacroix razon were finished obviously the owners of the quarry would want to sell the land after it 's been rehabilitated and if they want to sell it for it you know to be available for other activities they would initiate a plane change tell I just have one other question in between the like you said the new of you and I 'm not question your expertise it that the aquifer would be safe and enters the development like the one I was referring to but what what when it comes to foundations for four buildings for example yeah likely will propose for the what depth are they allowed to go down to turn piling now I can 't answer that question i 'm not a building code not spin with the building code but there 's a range of foundation options that in most modern house is probably i built using a concrete pad particularly in the areas west of the city where the land is better it 's more likely to be concrete paired-end_,_1491.109 piles i think also are reasonably it 's quite a long way down three or four meters at least at in those areas so i think they would beat some pretty deep piles but yeah we can find yeah the specifics will be the solution okay so so essentially we 're going to tick off this this chapter and we 're going to get a briefing on all of the issues that we 're braised and and actually organized a separate workshop to to discuss those and in many respects it would be quite good to do that and a live stream session because i think that the public are really really interested in this as an issue and it might be a really good feed into the district plan and dependent hearings panel and hearings all right _"

    "text": "I 'll now hand back to you project thank you madam chair good morning everyone well I hope today that we can finish the approvals of the stage two chapters so that they can go forward for notification on the second of May we 're also looking to approve all of the officers comments with the amendments from last week and what we need to still go through further today so that we 've finished covering them all so the documents that we need to be focusing on again other spiral-bound minister 's comments table and there is the very short table that looks the same that was also circulate circulated with some amendments and it to the spiral bound copy I have I believe you have been circulated a memo as to what was still remaining to be approved today so if we go to the top of that list and this will be in numeric order as we go through the spiral bound table so first up we have ellison just finishing off the temporary activities table i would note that there are two matters that will go to the central city chapter which will come to you on friday right and one of those is the sale of alcohol rule that we questioned last week you might recall we will bring that to you on friday specific i 'm actually pleased about that because we deferred the consideration of the local alcohol plan for a number of reasons not the least of which was the late notification so it came through as a late paper but the feedback from ministers on this issue has raised for me alarm bells because the previous council absolutely determined the local alcohol plan on the on the basis that this provision would be dealt with in the district plan and I 'm now deeply concerned that if we leave the local alcohol plan the way it is and the independent hearings panel were to prefer view of the ministers then we are actually stuck without any protection around the socio so this is the advice that I want to take between now and Friday because I 'm I 'm and and I think that we need you guys as the district planting in order to come up with some shared advice because it may well be that will have to completely start the local alcohol plan process again on the basis that we can 't rely on the district plan for a very basic rule that actually every city would expect to have by way of distance a buffer between you know venues let sell alcohol and in residential property so I think it 's a significant issue and it 's it 's it 's probably better that it 's arisen now and the in the time frame that we have to actually address that in the alcohol pack plan if we have to right yeah we 've invited the policy lead for the local alpha policy to come on Friday as well so be able to speak to the overlap between those issues that would be really good if the team could come as well yeah that would be brilliant they 're also getting some legal advice for you as well excellent thinking so that leaves just one rule for ellison to go over and I 'll hand over to seven around the notification requirements for fences and impervious surfaces in the water body setbacks and there was a question in terms of whether or not it was appropriate to remove the notification requirements in light of the discussion that we had last week I 'm suggesting a recommendation or amendment to the recommendation mmm so I 've distributed that before the meetings find it on your desk so this is this one here yes this is a little close i can taste going through this and so the original proposal was to remove as written approval and notification requirements for all classifications of water bodies what I 'm suggesting instead is to remove them only for water bodies where the primary primary matter of discretion is natural hazards because i think the assessment of natural hazards is generally a technical decision which requires flood modeling and extensive engineering understanding so i think in in those circumstances that it 's potentially not necessarily not necessary to have notification where it 's four types of waterways where we 're assessing the amenity effects that it is beneficial to have that notification arise from that notification process so what I 'm recommending is to remove it for the network and he 'll waterways because the primary concern there is the the flooding and natural hazards issues but to retain it for higher orders of waterways of downstream upstream and environmental asset bridleways where amenity is is one of those exits considered that sounds reasonable any questions don 't register um we had a pretty good discussion last time the thing I 'm still struggling to understand is the risk of removing this requirement for notification this is the benefit so it 's a shame fault not here we 're dealing with cases and the hills where people have got things on the boundary where water runs off and it 's causing all sorts of problems so I would have thought that people should have a right to be notified where something 's going to impact on them particular around water I just think it 's you know so I just can 't say you still have the discretion when you get the resource consent application to determine if it 's going to going to be no more than minor and you can do the notification that way so I don 't understand why we would remove that requirement because it should safeguard us against those really bad cases that a number of us care people are really upset that they haven 't been informed and they end up having a situation that is really unsatisfactory well under the fencing act when there 's a proposal to fence boundary between two properties there 's a requirement for one neighbor to notify the other neighbor and that neighbor has 21 days to object to that proposal so that provision acts in some way as notification so in most situations you wouldn 't have one neighbor being completely blindsided by the decision to develop along a property boundary except what people do on their own property can have a consequence on the waterway which can then ever further consequence downstream or men to people that are in the close proximity so we 're that 's a flooding issue that 's why we 're requiring consent at this point and the council would assess what those is that I think council is in the best position to make that assessment because it requires quite it 's quite a technical assessment that needs to be made and it 's a question of whether or not the neighbor would be able to provide that level of assessment that the council would provide in those situations but for something like amenity effects where it 's it 's not it 's more of a qualitative this decision making process in those situations I think it makes sense to retain the notification requirements yeah felt mine was a besides of feet soon I 'd like the impervious services once example layers of concrete driveway or put down clearly they can impact on neighbors below below that the drainage catchment yea this takes away the rights data to say this is going to fit my property again it 's because it 's a flooding issue and that 's quite a technical assessment that needs to be made in terms of how that impervious surfacing is going to affect flooding across the catchment I think the same argument holds for impervious surfaces for what you 're experiencing from counselors as they there are examples where the council has approved certain activities to occur and they have head flow on deliberate choice of words effects to other property owners but what you 're saying is that you know that the council ought to be providing really strong technical advice as to whether those fly on effects will occur but the trouble that you 're having is that it hasn 't always protected people right in the in the operative plan there 's no controls on impervious surfacing in the setbacks there 's no controls on fencing so these are new rules that are being introduced so this should improve the situation from where it has been in the past we are essentially neither fencing more impervious services we 're subject to the degree of technical analysis that you 're saying that the council will now undertake because the rules we 've written unto the plan right because now it 's triggering of concern for the first time well it sounds sensible to me so I don 't know what it may compare with what know I just would have thought this could have been stronger like for example but what we 're talking about I guess with water movement aren 't we we 're not just talking about flooding and clearly you know if people end up with having water running out of their house but that 's something they should know better than that which is why I use the phrase flow on effects quite deliberately because I think that what we 're hearing is is that the current or the operative plane didn 't have notification requirements because they didn 't have these provisions so writing in the provisions the question is is it a technical issue whether there are these flow-on effects and having not tune their minds to it in the past we 've had disastrous outcomes for some of our people when i 'm afraid the earthquakes have kind of exacerbated that and our knowledge around it has increased I you know I reminded myself of a report that was done on the on some of the decisions for developments and liquefaction prone areas which should never have gone but that 's the way it was this is a district plan for the way it should be yani the way I see this as for probably ninety percent of the time people probably won 't need to notify but when you get someone that owns say it 's a hit a lake or a river right it 's a good thing of Henson 's part where you 've got all those properties that have sorry I don 't know he 's dead up in the house Rudolf Steiner school where the heath get goes around Henson 's park so it 's that 's sort of here it off stone a skull where you 've got the rumor going around you 've got all those properties they have an interface to them but it 's not up in the house no that 's not but it 's it 's it 's um it 's the in the water what I sit back so what 's this for network and he 'll waterways so I presume that that he has a network waterway know it 's a dumb stream waterway right 's not applying to lakes and ponds or two larger rivers it 's it 's only to open drains and to Hill waterways where the gradient is over 1 + 50 right so so what 's an example of one in the city of a bird rain yeah of a network or a whole waterway network waterway would be ministers second and segments along edgware road that our network waterway so it 's just whatever it 's fine does open drain isn 't that work waterway so it dearly has constructed sides and low ecological value I think this is a distinct improvement on the current plane I you know I just I 'd really rather you know move on i think we 've answer question so some people obviously agree with it and others don 't_''_757.81 so shall we move to I mean I mean how do you want to bawl like a like a fortress alongside a waterway and the gets can see and the neighbors have no notification and suddenly you this is about impervious pervious surfacing and fencing standards that don 't currently exist our plane you need to consume understand that the question is if you need to apply for consent cuz you don 't meet those hunting standards do the people that are directly affected on each side of you or across from you have any right to be informed or in notified and to give their view in my view is years that 's a technical issue taken a military no it 's a technical issue as to whether it will have flow-on effects to other properties that 's the point so look I think that we agree that there are there are some councillors who think that this isn 't strong enough and there are other councillors who think that it is so I 'm happy to move that this the staff recommendation have I got a seconder for that position nobody would like to see connect position right so i will put that notion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so if we could have a show of hands please those in favor of the motion 5 those opposed 353 that 's carried thank you thank you copy and will now look at a specific purpose own Wigram and i have with me ben baird who is new to the council and assistant planner so this is the first time you will have seen him okay page 25 and the spiral bound copy this is the Sloan or they won I 've got little labels on mom yep yes all of that boxes for Friday right so what have we got here we 've got draft open space general procedures we 're on it 's not first Wigram specific papers no sorry i 'm just looking at what we 've got coming up and done to me that seemed to allow firearms to be discharged all day and every day and a military base component left in there yet the there is a designation on that area by the ministry of defense which is the purposes for defense purposes outlined in the 1992 pin sex so what does it actually mean that can happen there they can bring they can do raise and maintain armed forces for the protection on interests of new zone in that area that what could look like and the model of I don 't_''_992.64 I don 't know what I 'm destitute for they can match with guns like they did the other day at the big celebration offer it was more than matching with guns they can actually fire a whole pile of weaponry and things in the attack they possibly thinking I heard what we just recommended was to use the word defense purposes to recognize the fact that the Ministry of Defense has that designation on though they currently have that designation yes but what Gomez narrow highly intensified wizard each of subdivision is this just applied to some areas like the old runway or it 's just the specific purpose area as the designation area so the area around the museum this kind of vacant land around their end up 00 building with a land helicopters and things like that perhaps I could help it was leftovers a gifted man the original wood that was gifted a night for the rnzaf or whatever it was called back then by lady Orma Henry Wigram and so that the rest 37 hectares has been left as that was original gifted lane and it 's basically used it is designated for defense purposes but not otherwhere of any firearms practice really thing like that us happen the main thing i 'm not i think that 's wasn 't keen to incur no no that 's pretty unlikely they 've got bounnam that we 've got ahold of antique apply they go everywhere to practice their round there there right there the sniper practice whatever they do the the two users has been good to say is that newseum and the helicopter flying especially in any idea show but my concern was what they do a twist Melton being allowed to be done at Wigram I know what they do it with Melton I think it 's actually really dangerous and I certainly don 't want it happening with rue whole communities living around it would it be possible to raise with with defense that whether they 'd be willing to give up that designation because I mean to or to give or to give up aspects of it given its proximity actually thought about asking them whether they 'd life in the context of the district plan review to review their the status of the designation because I mean I 've attended events there with the with the young trainees but it but actually all of the particular military parades that I 've watched there they would be able to parade under our charter with the city anyway I 've got no problem with parades no no it 's just the firearms and in the middle there is Aditi medley I don 't know meh Demetria I have with me Sarah Oliver who has held discussions with the things there was some years ago when we did the southwest area playing wii and i had a number of conversations with the defeat of course they do want to keep that designation it whilst it does have a broad range of activities that they can use predominantly the air sort of strategic plan for the area just mainly indicated that be using it for you no more benign activities but they they indicated they would always keep their designation because it does mention one speak for civil defense purposes a favor needed to use it that would be a good use cause of its strategic location no I mean that they did the designation to get into that I don 't think they they sort of indication at that time they would done have any desire to remove it and in fact it 's been confirmed in stage one it has already been notified the Defense Force have said over I don 't know that you could say that the main function is the museum the museum is one activity that takes place within that area now they they suggested to change it to defense workroom because it has a broader range than just the airbase in the museum this is what the defense forces have asked for through the government through the minister 's comments so um that 's all good so that 's some bits that one 's picked off all right next one okay so the next one is looking at specific purpose own tertiary on page 30 just at the top of the world second box down from off that if I might know yep and I just want to understand what it actually meant could happen and couldn 't happen so sorry just a are we talking the item a about cisco place or item be at montana in both them so montana revos i understand it is owned by the university except for one property that 's right and is likely to be developed into accommodation for students yes and i 'd mentioned last time that that 's possibly going to take a bit longer to hip and then i had originally and undistorted but I 've got no problem what they already us for university practices and the other one the other one was in one property in cisco place which is also owned by the university and my general rule here had been to a fith it--is_,_1389.94 is owned by and contiguous with the wider property to give it the same zone so that was why it was originally shown on the stage to planning maps as powder for a wider community property I didn 't realize that actually yet probably wasn 't such they won 't to use it as an alternative service access to the hostels and you know put heavy traffic through local residential streets so I took advantage of the fact that that was Christian by the minister not for that reason but because it had changed from stage one to actually go with taking it back to residential okay okay thank you and no other changes around the universe no okay thank you very much that 's great so that 's a check _"

    "text": "oh the whole infrastructure committee just do we item CFO Berlin ripped if you might like to come and join us in Tim right that I think the staff speak to part of the pate accessible City one will be good the minimum tier you says as previous reports before you won the the first phase transport projects Demi from an accessible City this particular 16 approval from council to consult on three of those transport projects the three projects themselves are the one around Hospital corner so that 's what we call TP 1 b which is really the final works and around that area we 've already done the council 's will really enabling works I get in the traffic going in the right direction and those have been almost all implemented the other two ones that we 've briefed councillors on and I 've been before the ite committee as well and that 's tp3 which to do with the cambridge durham works and that 's really a renewal of that particular part of the street and TP for which is the Manchester Street which is really transport and we ended up with a I guess a high degree of immunity for both pedestrians and for PT users and around that area so the at the moment it 's not seeking we 're not seeking to prove would go out and do the works we 're only seeking approval to go out and consult on them and we know that there 's going to be a number of issues which members of the community will have an interest in and the process if we do get approval to go out and consult will really be to to take on board what their consultation is and feed becker 's look at potential changes as we 've done with previous schemes were brought before you brief the counselors on those what we think those should be get some kind of uh I guess tested approval of those and then report back through ite committee back to Council for approval to actually go and construct them so we don 't envisage to all go and well if we get approval today we don 't envisage construction starting until you know obviously in light of our review of our capital program where everything 's on the table what 's the BCR for each of these projects don 't know if the top my head to be honest that the funding for them is already provided through the cost year agreement as we 're referred to in page 263 72 million of which sara council an NZT a part funders they 're off the indicative costs for them as around the 14 15 million for each one of the projects so there is no chunky projects I don 't actually have the the bc 's for them them the they were all dealt with in a what 's called a sort of streamlined business case for that first phase of accessible city projects which was approved by the board of a New Zealand Transport Agency some time ago and the benefits of these projects are all being taken account of in a wider programme business case for the delivery of the entire accessible City program so as we briefed council in the past the primary drivers for these early projects are to achieve the mode shift towards those other modes that accessible City sets out to achieve and really are supposed to make those changes early changes to the road network that are prioritized in delivering accessible so I like I understand all of the reasons why these projects have got support what we didn 't know in there is it a question yani well yeah it is a question or come to question um so in terms of our capital program review any of these projects going to be reconsidered in light of the entire accessible transport theorem which is no not not these ones Soria venom cheer not these ones these are all funded and I was just thinking we do have a program business case and for all the Nexus and accessible city transport projects i think the BC was about three two one four two one so if you think of it around that sort of error you get a pretty good rate of return on your your one dollar investment you should get three or four bucks back so just the question to me on the financials between council Ciera NZTA that that figure excludes the bus and interchange until currently so I just want to check out of that 72 because if you take Manchester straight that projects gone from 22 million to 15 million so there 's money that 's being saved so I just want to get is it possible to get an understanding of how much of that 72 have we already committed because I understand that does that include the super stops and the wicked and road and can we just get some idea of okay can we just get nice like that question of the 72 million what has been spent quite cancel the the only funding that 's already been spent on these three projects where the interim works at a hospital corner so those who are think we 're in there about the region of about one and a half million of the summit you have before you today the other works as designs have been developed for the concept designs for all three projects some of the individual cost allocations to those have buried a little from the year but the overall funding for the three projects as they stand at the moment is almost identical to the Sun that we brought to cancel last May 's I think those about 43 23.5 million okay any other questions well this doesn 't like so if the government says we 're only and it 's been 22 million on me sorry 15 on Manchester straight and not the 22 that we hit on budget we 've prioritized and removed some projects from phase 1 because it wasn 't enough money so FF lacoste have gone down so what happens we 're is an unspent capital stage 10 the accessible transport plane I 've just heard that we spent 6.6 million after up to really much of that content so that 's how much food are you still anticipating that 72 million will be this cost of this entire project you see only I think remains over the the first year old twin bridges and basically there was money allocated for were betterment in relation to that but as we know that the costs of their overall replacement is significantly which are unallocated at the end and that would be the main thing that relates to okay thank you so you have recommendations before you is there any other questions questions yeah thank you just on the funding split there which that includes that with the three parties is that you include the whole splits yes so the Senate 52-48 so 272 million is 27 from us 27 from Sarah and 18 from NZTA so that 's the split thank you right you need abate yani oh yeah um in live our financial situation I don 't support these projects going ahead until we 've managed to do a capital review it 's interesting to note that the government appears to have done some capital review because they 've reduced the cost of the Manchester Street project from 22 to 15 million which I still think is a huge amount of money to be spent on it on it on a straight and the central city if you think about the scale of money that 's been spent on these individual streets these are the costs of Swing pools or think it 's good to go out for consultation until we really have been able to go through our capital works program I 'm not convinced that the benefit cost ratio sticks up for these projects and I think in light of the information that we are still to receive around our infrastructure repairs we don 't know what the shortfall will be but when we 've got broken streets and some suburbs there are not going to be fixed in the next 20 to 30 years and these projects getting gold plated I can 't support it I want to see all that motion together so that we can work out where the priorities are and actually spend the money accordingly i 'm also really concerned at the number of trees that are going to be removed as part of this project I think it 's really sad that we 're losing so many mature trees and our central city what we know from consultations previously people wanted the central city to be a green space they wanted more greenery not less and sadly of course we 're losing know on men chester street we were told that that project couldn 't change but when you look at the changes that have been occurred you start to question why the majestic theatre was pulled down and doesn 't even look like it was necessary so i won 't support these going ahead today i think we need to work through our capital program review first okay felt so when the project aren 't going here today clearly as a lot as the staff of seed this is really the council are prepared to put this out to consultation to seek the views of the community and I I too am a tree lover I have been down and looked at those trees on along numbers heat and clearly unfortunately many of them are uprooted their lifted up right now and they are one has already fallen over they they have been deemed to be a health and safety matter I think the matter about broken streets in yannis right and unfortunately we 've got broken streets in in a city and we 've also got people trying to get 's to me really what that 's about and there is a new design and on top of that of course the there 's a serial requirement that and we have an agreement with the van in fact we would do it so I 'm supporting the recommendations they are simply really asking the people for their views about this important part of our simplicity okay can I put them out clean I have a lot of sympathy for council yo Hanson 's point of view on this item concerned about the costings but I do want to hear from the community I do want to hear them talk about priority so if we look at the pages road bridge and the pits to your bridges these are our lifelines and I really want to hear the community 's say we 've got some big programs in the city is we do have the accessible city projects but we have some major lifelines in the city which actually needed attended to so I do i do really encourage the community to get behind and make your voice no cool so going to put it those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and do you want your vote recorded against jaani jaani would like this boat recorded against a fine public realm network playing streets this is now got all sorts of lovely things in it it 's got quickly designs and edible trees and all sorts of things editor sure do you want to say anything look I think this plan is a good example of working collaboratively with Sierra trip to put together to take some some basic information that the council are developed and a draft streetscape plan and standards and things and working with Sierra to put together some agreed standards to guide both the streetscape works in the central city and the anchor projects so I think the important thing to remember as it doesn 't commit you to any spending doesn 't there 's no you know you 're going to see all these projects such as the central city transport projects you were just looking at they 're going to come back to you for both for approval for the projects before but it just provides some guidelines for for for designers for the different teams of designers working on different projects we 've been to a couple of workshops with you and you 've asked some changes which we made we went to the the the Environment Committee and and we made some more changes there which are embodied in the recommendations and we have group mocked up how these would appear in the final document if you 'd like to see that but really you know I think it 's just it 's that I 've disturbed let 's go back to publisher and ask questions is just around the parking issue is i 'm really pleased to see the parking plan and in this document the concerns I have is the reduction of 10,000 on the street parks to buy 3900 is it the next whatever okay see you don 't want to come too late i think so it 's so on is it the same with the delegating there is the decision making out as well going on but they will put they all fall under the question I asked you at the at the committee meeting that when we see the word greening yep it doesn 't necessarily denote grass set correct that 's great to you yeah and so that was you i won 't wanting to broaden it out to see if we can actually be open to including that in some areas of the public places because i think that 's interpretation of what i 've taken from this year an idea that people didn 't want green on the ground not just in the trees in the shrubs so it 's possible to take into account yes my my understanding of the green section as the design principles as it would be possible to put grass and as an example of greeting and it covers greening both in terms of ground cover and crees and in sustainable design elements and the streets oh that 's great thank you here it 's not off the time do um just several things um do you in terms of the individual drawings for each particular straight is there going to be any chance to consult one that comes to mind where there 's been a deputation yep so this is making an assumption that victoria street we clear DK pets on road cycleways bus lanes but so yes the answer is year so in terms of those it is just as a design guide it 's only a guide it doesn 't require anyone to do anything so victoria street for instances as part of the phase two of the n XS for city projects and i think we 've gotten our draft LTP at around the 16 17 area so we 'd assume that we go through a similar process to what we 've done in relation to the first phase projects whereby we mock up some concept designs run them past the councillors get approval to consult result bring them back to you etc etc so don 't take what 's in there as being something that 's already designed developed and a done deal cos it 's not supposed to be it 's it 's I guess it 's our view as to what it might look like given the road hierarchy to be an approval process and there the opportunity for consultation is part of it and I 'm just the question on the naming policy that was something that we 'd previously asked for is there a naming policy and here i couldn 't i am but now i don 't have an email on this park named in this full council and roads a community board and except for central city Winona 's full council so that there 's not a naming policy in the document itself but there 's a separate process but for the layers we have lots of council policy to relate to the central city around our streets like we have infrastructure design standards to ask for an report what we did ask for that okay well it 's not covered in here okay if you want it to be you 'll have to ask for a separate report right it 's not part of this okay and then just the final question for me is when I look at the the the central city this only seems to seems to stop it Madras street the whole for ebbs and we had a number of laneways through the inner city east for example but it doesn 't seem to get captured through here what you 're doing in that inner city east area in terms of the public realm certainly the public realm plan does cover all of the central city you know some of the areas where some of the chapters are any likely to address parts of it as is their focus but some of the other ones when you look at public transport we see that shows that public transport roads going out to fits your dev so does cover the whole area but but we 're not envisage in that every part of it will have public realm money second on it covers the whole area right so if you think it will just on page 77 off Aubert we have a policy that we would have lines through he referred worcester gloucester armor we hit a lanes policy and we put money aside and we 've acquired property but i can 't see anything in this document that links links one of the key things that we 'd identified for public realm was to have laneways through those really large blocks and then at least he 's um the lanes that are shown in these plans are indicative of there were currently in existence or they 're currently planned so they don 't count out more lanes in the future that 's not it 's not an implant it 's not a it 's not a final design but it 's showing what 's approved now or or you know or in existence all right so it doesn 't preclude any further lanes going on at any Surak right and this does any further debate all Christians sorry Paul what he should have targeted my question I am a little can soon about the public realm taking away car parking spaces to a reticle degree that it is and I 'll continue the conversation are young parking claim that 's cool okay haven 't_''_1216.94 got any amendments I 've got a mover and a seconder for what 's coming from the Environment Committee can I put that now those in on to the draft christchurch central city packet central parking plan hi so rich is just staying there for the entire duration cuz he 's in charge of everything do you want to outline anything on on this case um Chris juvenile yeah so is that one yeah so the parking plan is part of the crash it set to a recovery plan an accessible City and so we know that parking is critical support the recovery of the central city we also wanted to support becoming a vibrant and prosperous central city providing safe and easy access to the city to try and reduce congestion and it 's also about trying to support modal shift along with making it really easy to access the central city and so the overall aim i guess with the parking plan is really about providing information to help guide our understanding around the appropriate level of parking that is needed to support the recovery we 've also identified potential locations at a kind of high level of where we think parking facilities are most needed based on where the highest demands are and parking principles which help to guide the design of future parking buildings short-term parking forecast tools so we can monitor what is happening on there and streets right now and out to 2018 and operations and draft operations plan which we want to bring back to council later so we can better manage our assets and cycle parking and then an action plan at the end which mainly focuses on how we offer and operational and priorities and so the main recommendation is really for cattle to focus on short stay Park came through the rebuild our own assets and by working with her life private suppliers to deliver parking as you know we started the eoi process around that and following the last cat time we 're at council and we 've done some more public consultation and with the ite committee and sort of incorporated the feedback from that into the revised plan particularly focusing on revising some of the demand numbers and looking at the model that we were using because there was uncertainty raised around that and we 've also set up more monitoring particularly around supply rates that we 're using in the parking plan so I guess we 're just here today to try and seek approval for the parking plan and have it taken your question okay any questions because it 's quite a reasonably grunty document Paul first then Jimmy and Yanni just gotta talk through the gamer so it 's the reticle reduction of the on the street parking and it 's about thirty-nine percent my figures are correct I with actually on our street parking in the central city in pre-earthquake we we calculated the amount of traffic that was generated by parking on service streets and take into account what was say let 's take literally the street for an example sake and the reduction of the on street parking on those trees essentially we could increase the levels of parking on various streets because of the reduction of the on the street parking so I just oh I don 't hear that coming through some of the rhetoric so the question is is it will you take into account that massive reduction of on-street parking that can be street parking locations that you 're talking about the supply forecasts that we 've gotten a demand for classic take account of that so we know we 've estimated how much and parking will be lost particularly through transport projects and public realm projects and we 're now monitoring that as well and we 're adjusting how much off street parking supply we need based on that so is included and accounted for on top of that I just I 'd like to flag a concern just just with regard to a one rule applies with central or Christchurch has been decentralized in many respects or the we have various business districts in Christchurch now lots of central city and what we 've got is we 've got a duopoly of how we treat these areas so we 're allowing some of these large suburban centres to put massive car parks on that actually generate a huge amount of traffic and constrict streets to the to the ridiculous and whilst we want to have a beautiful nice easy friendly walking City that 's just a point just that i 'm about actually applying that same rule that you apply here in central city into the suburban activity centres so in terms of mingling this doesn 't that like the parking plan itself is a non-statutory document and that and the whole purpose of it is for it to be live and that 's what we 're seeking you know approval from counsel from so we recognize that we need to update it when your information comes on board in terms the rules this doesn 't change any of those is a very permissive regime in place for the central city at the moment what 's the minister made through the through an accessible City you basically allowed to provide up to fifty percent of your gross leasable floor area and parking now many developers are choosing not to do that that 's their prerogative but in terms of the the malls themselves yet different rules do apply there but we 're looking to kind of change those through the district plan as well so this this is really a guidance document and it 's a policy document and what it it really says these are the areas where we think you 're going to have a shortfall and car parking these are what we think the demand rates are going to be and and we will use it ourselves in terms of saying well this is where council might want to invest its money but it 's also got to be used by the private sector as well to say well if we see an opportunity in the market we 're going to use this information we 're going to go in and do something about it so it 's not supposed to be sitting stone it 's just supposed to be there as a guidance and policy document for all those people so hope that clarifies some of it dan has I 've got Jimmy Yanni Jamie Jimmy because I based on your presentation your particular mention this is parking place their life document by we reviewed on page 273 the Stargate we dated for six point four quarterly monitoring the you please confirm with us this quarter mandatory is so that under four times a year will be not necessarily I guess what we 're doing is giving board and his team are going out there on a quarterly basis and monitoring the amount of on-street and off-street parking and basically working out with it whether they 're sufficient supply to meet the demand and we also get a whole lot of information that other information that filters into that as well but but that might show that there 's no need to change the figures or it might sure there 's a radical need to change them it 's just moving that quick that we feel we need to monitor on a quarterly basis but that doesn 't mean the document needs to change on a quarterly basis it will depend on what 's happening on the ground okay so if there should not any the na show the impact now there 's no it 'sit well the financial impact is in terms of us doing the work I guess so that there is ongoing costs but I can 't speak to help but those are I want to mention that huge thank you for um Yanni the principles which I think are really important our accessibility and affordability so have you done any work around those areas in terms of for example coming in to use the library or to go swimming paying you know more and car parking charges than the cost of soil is there any any consideration in terms of accessibility from from an affordable point of view for car parking in the central city I think while we might not use those words per se you know accessibility deserts it needs something which underpins those principles and if you turn to page five to one of your report which has the parking principles outlined in a little bit more detail though the first one parking sport economic vitality that 's top of the list you know you 're not going to support economic vitality if you 're if you 're charging it 's such a high rate that 's going to use it so it 's it 's almost inherent within that assumption but the parking operations plan that that Kevin and his team are doing which will bring back which he that 's all about pricing to ensure that we get a good all year but you explain a bit of the moment well it 's about utilization more than anything and that 's where it to a certain degree it 's it 's blind to the type of activity that is so you 've got a fixed resource you want to make sure that utilized is best what you possibly can and that were the utilization and the mechanisms around determining that and pricing if you like we 'll be all picked up in the parking operations plan and more detail but sure there would be I would think that there would be some some allowances certainly for accessibility to public public facilities very just just in terms of you know one of the things we heard about Litchfield was that it was really good for the disc it was it was probably the best car park for people with disabilities but I don 't really get a sense of that those sorts of basic barrier-free design things will occur through parking provision particular off street definitely in then yeah the existing city by definition it 's in the parking principles have got picture underneath and we 've actually got to say old and short stay parking Illustrated right on that basement levels it 's the first thing that you see when you come in right so that 's kind of what we 're trying to do to go thank you a lot yani just a final question is the thing that 's missing for me is that we 've got council provision of car parking so um in this room well if you look at the man so 517 you 've got opportunities what we don 't have in here is where council spending a lot of money on car parking so at our community board yesterday one of the things that that came to mind was the fact that we 're spending money as an organization and providing car parking for our staff at a huge cost and in providing on off street parking for the community at a lower rate than what we 're paying so if we wanted to save money using some of our own requirements meet rather than paying private people to deliver that service set three or four times the cost would seem a sensible way to go so is there a work stream in here that looks at where we currently got leases on car parks and where we own car parks and making sure that we 've got a financial efficiency that that area probably sits between property and in my team putting lots so it as you mentioned at the board meeting yesterday the it was was highlighted at the time I have already spoken to a couple people about that the possibility of picking up one side and then having a look at the facility side of things at the moment they are split but do take your point that the we do provide some public parking in places where the public will require it for access to facilities like eglee back but not very far from there we 're paying on a property lease basis if you like which is different to a parking lease basis for car parks for staff and for various other council activities yeah with the residential yeah there 's the front of home sorry Ivan to raise it but just when I look at you met and I presume 517 is really the kind of key kind of map but I know since this is being done we 've had the changes to Central City living so is there a work stream in here around just looking at that whole intensification of the urban residential areas and what possible solutions there are in terms of parking provision Western you know no longer hit require minimum requirements as part of the development because I would have thought a net northeast quadrant their significant demands on on parking but there 's no kind of so in terms of the residential provisions obviously those have been set by the minister as per the residential chapter and I think we 'll have to see how it shakes down in terms of what people actually provide on-site because while they might not be a minimum parking requirement through the statutory provisions that doesn 't stop anyone actually providing for car parking themselves and one of the things that they say fear regime to parking as what people are actually providing because previously we had a degree of certainty with the minimums that we had and we knew that people would hear there to provide them or seek a resource consent now we 're playing a bit of a guessing game to see what people will do so yep it might become a bit of an issue for us if no one 's providing in your on-site parking but then I 'd really question whether they 're going to be able to they all don 't sell residential properties and not provide any parking on site so i think you know you 've got a the market and a sensible determine what degree of parking is required for properties to shift okay Jamie I have full confidence in the IT committees that 's nothing along those lines but it 's just done just interested in the staff rational around the delegation what was the point of delegating there 's there just to be number just to be number really I mean that it 's one of the key recommendations moving so quickly and and we want to keep this as up-to-date as possible so really to do that rather than report back through ite and council we simply thought the delegations remain to her twice year and we weren 't really impressing that that be changed the parking principal will call fundamentals of the document has really just going off the number starts shifting and someone got bangs and a big parking building somewhere then all of a sudden that could have a bit of a change to this there you go okay you modify your fingers accordingly so it 's really just to take into account what 's actually happening on the ground what people were providing may I do kind of a yarn final panel then yep perfect year of your indulgence um that 's just as really um around the word recommended thing just so I 've got a handle on that is that recommended by staff or recommended by the committee when you just say to approve any recommended changes do you mean staff recommendations yep so as long as they 're not deviating from committee had a new recommendation that differed from staff and would come back to councillors they 're up to be honest I thought that one through but that might be a way forward maybe fills those velvet flea what I consider a dance that was discussion informally this morning and like it clearly if there are major shifts for example including major numbers of car parking then I would expect certainly be clear agreement that the committee would maybe recommend a recommendation but it would be a council decision and I was also going to ask them can we just clarify that because it came very early this morning on both riccarton road and parking and various other big issues those big issues we agreed the ite committee would refer back to the council so so yes what would it be easier if it was happy with it just to say than any staff recommended changes good it 's just verifies it a bit Thanks yep because I was just going to cheat with Richard like I would expect from what 's in the report that in fact any changes all likely be talking about large numbers of car parks in one in my head well I guess if council widow her make a decision on something you know north of the square is an area which the IT can I te committed you if you look at 6.5 on on page 273 the committee noted there was concern about lack of confirmed shorts day park in north of the square so something like that is a someone came in with a big facility north of the square that would be a bit of a game changer and you know that would be the type of thing that we 'd look to bring back Paul just on a delegated stuff in central city is a part of the Hagley theorem award and there is no one on the eddie committee there are fears so there 's no representation so I 'd like to move it up I have discusses with all that from a member of that either yeah I like to go on the committee right so it 's not have another one of those debates just now how yeah that 's fine for you so you thought that would fill and bring something back okay so what we 've got before us in terms of staff freak me in terms of the recommendations is just one minor amendment is the debate our debate on this Yanni picking up on the point that that committee might be authorized to make changes but actually the board should be involved like actually this there were before the earth quite similar and a half thousand people have lived in the central city who vote for community board members to present them a number of parking issues are right with the local community board as people in mira vale record own or phenyl some way Murray will be aware so you know I don 't_''_2367.849 I don 't think it 's right that the community board doesn 't have the powers of recommendations as for any other community board in the city so in terms of those delegations is it possible to add some step that at least that community board can be notified and have an opportunity to comment mr. Phil what sensible in my view to actually incorporate solutions like that and being decisions when it comes to looking at the delegations for all communal Ords and certainly with issues like this is a big one and so mainly from the point of view making sure whether all of us is a workable however if it comes up before then you will actually deal with it yep okay right right any other debate if not can I put this up with there 's slight amendment there put that those in favor say aye those opposed carried and in Part B items moved by Phil seconded by pauline and I put all of those and Patsy and that again comes back to that issue of delegation okay _"

that without actually seeing the slam well I would like to know that it 's going ahead and win because we 're stopping the road with no indication that there is any building about to begin so can you give us an update on when the convention center project as likely to commence and as this a time-sensitive decision around road stopping that now I can 't actually tell you how important this is because I don 't know how long this process is going to take but I do know they want to try and open up as fast as they came so open up what I could come but I don 't know if you know which is it all question there 's no important that building is imminent but what we 're being asked to do though is to support ccd you using its statutory powers to road once stopped and be stood on the council to the crown under Section 53.3 of the CRA which preserves any offer back obligations account to my head is I 'm totally fine with it into going on that side that 's right and I would just really like to know when and how that is about to happen because we 're sort of stepping up the road access without but certainly no foundation stones being made in there no but I think you 've got a briefing on the winners and how is part of the mondays briefings got requested I think it the Community Housing Committee and we 've put it into the program sorry i don 't have the program with me but you are going to get that breathing in the very near future yeah so as the paper says we don 't actually have a choice unless mentor we 're not actually making a decision in this matter because this is a process of quote consultation not approval so there is effectively no decision to be made it 's an opportunity to provide feedback and that we would like to have an update on the progress on the convention center because the convention center is called critical to that you know that the infrastructure of the central city for you know that our visitors strategy for everything that we need to be doing and and that land is already yet and so that 's that 's what we 're that 's the feedback we 're giving and it 's the comment we 're going so I 'll move the motion Becky Yul second up no yes you will I 'll pull down step Paul lonsdale was second doing up take out council it back all right take her out just a further question of staff has has there been any traffic muddling done because the thing is we 've got the approach there so I mean I recognize that this is designated and we don 't have a lot of choice although we could challenge it in terms of recovery whether it 's actually needed to take the road from the city but but the thing that concerns me as in the interim short period I don 't know why you 'd close the road now ahead of having the plans in the designs and you know what confidence can we have that this can be used in the short term to actually deal with you know pretty chronic access issues to the central city I don 't know if any modeling has been done that would be out to the accessible City project i 'm sure they must have had something i don 't know personally about that the road won 't be closed just because it won 't be closed that quickly the process itself can take i believe up to a year it probably won 't you 'll probably be quicker than that though but I mean it 's not it 's not something that you could just go out there and just stop the road up because you have to you has to go through the process including approval by the minister yeah it does a reasonably long process but perhaps we can include in our feedback we want the road to remain open as long as it is practical yeah get across the Gloucester Bridget canvas right so the exes is not really there impeded yeah and and it was it was closed at some time when there was demolition from the library building as well so you 're right but I presume that the Gloucester bridge will become more of a footbridge rather than a braid else right now people shaking me I say here was important for our work but Sarah saying it will be part of a convention so we said they 'll pay for it completely the time across the streets clean other seems impossible anyway because of the things like that well maybe maybe we need to transfer the bridge ownership is at the same time and then they 'd have to pay for it yeah oh okay videobook somebody 's staff has been abuzz that the initial route from the convention center could start in may 2015 they 're cold that 's next month what 's the degree of likelihood a bit okay that we could repeat depends on your definition of work also I suppose I certainly demolishing stuff on that site at stuff happening on that site that there are issues of that contract obviously they 're working through those are looking through the financial application of how they met a necessary part of the briefing right but there 'll be some ground preparation anyway before they even start building yeah no no no but they have to dig up the road there 's a whole lot of infrastructure stuff anyway but anyway i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no yes have that recorded thank you carried me in the end that so do we want to put a note earlier about leasing it remain open for as long as possible well we 've our staff to include that in the feedback formally okay yeah _"

the criteria in my head and uncurling Edwards head so but I 'm happy that here and I sat down and establish a set of criteria for you to look at yeah alright so the next item on the agenda is infect your own committee 's report and I know because I 've read this report that you are not going to move this item on the agenda because you voted against it so I think would like to move it and Ally would like to second it so i will have we got staff here to assist us with this one Richard I was born right if people got questions for staff yani just on page 133 you have a date for that table 1 that just energy more scenes what what that 's telling us telling me is that despite the fact that we 've lost a large number of machines we still have some of the highest expenditure in the country per person on these machines you signifies from the country have you got any kind of ideal well I manager good 10 change yeah because one of the things that we were I get on the assumptions behind the thinking that previously has been that limiting exceeds the more availability and accessibility the the more problem gaming which is in the more community calm but actually this is kind of starting to show that maybe there 's some other factors as well but we need to be thinking of there 's no there 's no clear reason for the expenditures being so high rather not changing the Department of Internal Affairs said you know just the context situation and the girl sorts of different reasons now looked at the literature and there 's no hard and fast answer so that when they say that there are complex reasons what are the sort of is that any any of its earthquake-related no I don 't think it 's quite related it 's simply that if people are going to gamble then they will and they have a certain amount that they generally spend and so they just that 's what they do what 's a week may just use the same if there are fewer machines they use what 's available more intensively so that the actual Heather of off gambling and in the population doesn 't really very much and the amount that they 've got doesn 't very much the expenditure in Christchurch is very level really a few spikes kind of around the earthquakes but then back to level again around it twenty million dollars a quarter that was probably because the casino was closed from februari through June and so people were probably gambling more on the pubs and fruits because they couldn 't gamble in the casino right and Paul it 's just on that is here has it been any work done on the age group of people with actually gamble and just thinking considering we have a all those the Asian population you 're empty I think they aid renal Asian aging with an older population here are crisis of this wandering effect as a factor of why it hasn 't changed much don 't think so it 's across the board although typically Mallory and lower socioeconomic area people tend to gamble more so um so you 're saying that even if we had more machines or if the machines were simply distributed elsewhere that it wouldn 't make a difference to the figures no it just moves a problem for one area to another eight centuries thing cuz it 's complete opposite of what the advice has always been it 's the complete opposite of the basis of the policy the report on page 131 actually in 4.2 says there is little evidence that a relocation policy that move venues and machines away from lower carriers of low income will reduce any harm caused by gambling or oh and over expenditure because I remember a case in point last year where we support what wanted to support the removal of a license from one area all of them they want you to shift the machines into Eddington Raceway which is kind of weird gambling happens every 10 after seems out of surely into the Raceway and and this policy stopped us from doing after doing it so why are we recommending not to change the policy so everything that you are now telling us is a tour that this report tells us is actually contrary to the basis upon which I 'm assuming that policy was initially derived that if you cut the number of machines the inclination and the actual expenditure on gambling diminishes but what I 'm now hearing is that it 's a constant it doesn 't really matter how many machines you have or where they are or where they 're so if you relocate them it doesn 't make a difference to the amount that people spend no that 's what we are assuming based on this evidence that we 've got that the expenditure stage relatively stable and even though none venues and machines have dropped the expenditure hasn 't viewing now yeah basically now we understand we know end in australia that show that accessibility does make a difference there if you are within five kilometers of a venue you are more likely to gamble thing or use the poteen thing then if you were further away but that 's what we mean when we say it 's complex it 's a complex situation it but we did want to put in front of you the fake you know that we do have this evident evidential base now that suggests that the expenditure doesn 't very very much even when the numbers are dropping and do we know that sorry yeah do we know that some genes per thousand residents and relatively do we know that that 's true for all levels of machines so is this evidence borne out in other places and in any sort of other densities of gambling opportunity like with casinos and so for example do we have research from other places in the country from other places offshore where they 've got less than 4.59 per thousand residents where if they 're dropped below a certain live all that the that the you know just tear on a district as a reasonable it 's not a bad example I guess I mean they have you know 37b news for example and only 520 machines but they spend per capita for your resident five dollars 71 oh sorry machine sorry expenditure is 77 21 which is higher than what we spend in Christchurch pure and we have fewer machines yes but does this research but like is this research sort of situational or would it be borne out across other research that we 've looked at was that is it that you like is this research profound enough and detailed enough or is their contradictory research around such that we might want to change our view upon the relocation of Sheens well no it is it is like all the literature sees that it 's a complex social assuring that up to up and I mean up until 2009 the studies the most recent study that we did and we looked at in the impact you know social impact suggested that accessibility does make a difference um so yeah there is contradictory yes otherwise well it 's not that 's its literature you know that the the studies you know what that was a but that it 's referred to as a meta-analysis of surveys of problem gambling prevalence but our actual evidence of what 's actually happened in christchurch shows that it hasn 't made a difference to the allowability seen it reduces access for problem gamblers and the problem gambling foundation and the Salvation Army and the likes say that yet the more accessories then the more you know to have an effect on problem gamblers so reducing the number of machines or venues does help problem gamblers despite horsham Utley I were they were very strong supporters of keeping the policy as it was because from their perspective they felt that yeah moving it to another place just move the problem somewhere else it wasn 't actually going to change the problem no no no and the two different issues so you know i mean the example of moving machines out of shirley which is a residential area into eddington raceway which is a gambling area to me i couldn see what I mean like that was that that 's the actual practical example that we have of how the policy has worked and practice and so to have no flexibility on relocation hasn 't actually helped you know I mean if that 's true then reducing the number of machines and surely would be a good thing because people who go to Eddington Raceway go there to gamble more mainly they might go there for other reasons but coffee mainly gambling I mean I do you know I don 't know it 's just I kind of would want to see I personally would have liked to have seen just a little bit of flexibility around vineyard relocations rather than a hard-and-fast blanket rule so that you know that I mean effort you know like the one that was that the actual example that we 've got that there could have been some flexibility around that one but anyway Glen Ben Ali thank you my question is about the reference to post disaster studies we can use the post-disaster study Vicki referred to situational before so that 's what our mental health services are overrun and I think it 's quite reasonable that we must take that into account as a high conservative you know top considerations of page 189 69 in the in the work with this the post-disaster studies acknowledge that disasters place added challenges on individuals for you is that a strong part of this report hmm it is yes so we 're on we 've had a policy up till this time we 're on the other side of natural disasters still feeling the effects but obviously that must be taken into yep and different from other cities it was the first question I honestly that was the first question I asked was whether the earthquake made a difference this may also apply it 's not conclusive but the number sorry I 'm I was outside with it I 'm visually visually challenged at the moment you like my glasses that first that first vigorous September 2009 so apart from the spike after the earthquake yep that wasn 't maintained it actually went back to situation normal so that the practical experience doesn 't match paid yes but that 's all we 're talking about are the other venues crees from the casino been closed yeah and it would have stayed but if we take out their spike it hasn 't yeah but then I 'd expect to see the numbers going up yeah yeah Ellie think one of the issues when we discussed us around the committee was if I can just draw your attention to 5.15 on page 135 which related to regardless of and correct me if I 'm wrong regardless of what the local authorities policy is on gambling there are circumstances where these are overruled and that is a good example of that and what would have been required to change our policy for no reason because it could be overruled that 's why I certainly voted the way I did on this could you just talk to 5.5 a 15 a little but as regards its relevance with any change or not that we would have in Christchurch the our policy doesn 't allow for relocations per se but if a venue is moving a short distance say up same staff keep the name so number of machines then there 's legal precedent for that to be able to happen but it 's our only regardless of our policy but it 's only a short distance and it 's keeping everything else the same what is a short distance subsequently well Alton you could say 50 meters or it receive if you if you took a tier in a TI v or of gammon venue in a mouth then it could just move right down the melon smells are quite large I think the legal precedent was something like 25 meters yep yeah no no it 's true so i 'll put that motion oh oh sorry okay yep sorry gleam okay I 'm gonna stand up for this this is a big deal for me and for a lot of us we as a council I 've had a long and proud history of upholding the sinking lid policy in my view on this today is if you open the door to relocation you will actually serve to undermine this is my view and compromise that policy and previous item when it came before the council earlier in this term and which was accepted by a majority of 12 22 I can give you figures here they 're quite compelling of the social cost of pokie machine gambling to this city in terms of lost economic output 30 million dollars a year loss loss of household income is 8 million loss of employment 630 full-time equivalents Christchurch lost seventy nine point eighty five million to non casino gambling machines last year at first of those who use them have a problem and two-fifths will develop a problem at some point if we start compromising this problem on this policy the mental health service providers such as a problem gambling foundation Merck and others will be very dismayed take note of page 130 that are pretty clear over that we 've got to keep the policy as it is as I said we are known for our sinking lid policy in the city and I think to go back on that today by compromising on this really opens the door to weakening that policy and I really implore you I just wanted to make the point that um although the information we 've got shows that despite having this thinking love the expenditure is staying you know roughly the same I think you also have to recognize that crushed urge despite having the sinking lid still has the highest number of machines per thousand residents out of any of the major cities so we actually still have a huge number of machines across our city which I think means that they are very accessible and so I think it is probably a little bit hard just to look at and say well because the expenditures stayed the same that this policy hasn 't worked in fact maybe the expenditure would have been going up exponentially if we not had a sink England and I would suspect that with everything we know from the health services around the increased demands on our mental health system and on the addiction services there actually it does seem logical where we 've got to I guess the reason for me asking the question to start with was is there anything more we should 's been caused by Gimlin because we know how much harm has been done and when we look at the map and see that it 's the poorest areas and poorest neighborhoods that are paying that price I just wonder whether there is any more that we can be doing to try and address some of those negative impacts that gaming hairs so I think we can do more work around around there as a social issue but obviously with our policy I think I support keeping it in place as it currently is and looking at what other conversations were money to have with places like dia or maybe the health system around what the treatment patterns are and what the abduction patterns are and whether there 's anything else that should be done could be done going forward but you know I think this council I agree this council has a proud record of recognizing the harm caused by gaming and trying to address it and I think we should continue on David thank you i 'm probably going to take a totally different tekton this whilst recognising community that does have a problem with gambling and we do have problem gamblers the reality is and we noted on page 131 there 's little evidence that if you relocate these machines outside of the poorer areas of the city that we actually improve gambling harm if you 're a problem gambler you will go anywhere to play the machines it doesn 't move it I think the other thing that there 's two other aspects that I really wanted to address in it and this comes down to more our role as funders of community produce community organizations and I 've had a long and a very involved association with a number of sporting groups when we are applying for funding to to run our particular activities the City Council has slashed 1.5 million dollars off its community funding programs and I know that just in the LTP that for our own reward I think the community grant scheme has been cut another seven thousand dollars so my concern really whilst acknowledging problem gambling is more for the funding of community projects when we 've heard that the 't changed but what has changed is the number of community groups and sporting groups and other groups that are applying for funds they are exponentially increasing and the pool of funds whilst it may still remain the same in the gaming industry it 's reducing an hour pull the number of people that are applying to it increasing significantly even this morning we had the Mount Pleasant community group in here who who have applied for funds for various things and they 're now resorting to the mural fund to to get money for their project that demand on funds for our community groups is as quite as organ so I look at the sinking lid policy and whilst in general yes I do support it I do think very seriously about its impact on our community to to fund projects the other aspect those two aspects that I 'm concerned about is sinking blood policy which yes I could possibly agree with but the location of machines i think is absurd and we heard the example that Leanne gave and I supported her late last year where we 50 meters of each other each of them with 18 machines and we had the absurd situation where we could have lowered the number of machines in one venue at the specific request of that venue to relocate them to the eddington Raceway our policy declined that activity to occur I think it was very sensible and and for obviously for the reasons of the policy as it stands now it couldn 't happen though i would i would actually urge that we perhaps look again at our locations policy that does seem quite absurd that you know on the one hand doesn 't matter if you take them out of low socio-economic areas that we that has no impact and on the other hand we have a policy that doesn 't allow so i 'm going to vote against the resolution i would like to see some more work done on it I believe we have room to move on certain aspects and and particularly where we are in our own funding model reducing our support for community organizations I find it quite absurd that we are curtailing the number of reasons which show most of them are outlined I will be voting against this proposal today well I would have accepted I would have voted for an amendment that would allow for a review of the relocations policy only in relation to the removal of machines from areas of you know residential areas to 2 locations more suitable you know for tunics that to a gambling venues such as a raceway but that amendment hasn 't been moved so i 'll put the motion sorry yeah what would you like that amendment that well I mean oh let it be reviewed because the evidence and here as much as I support the concept that 's not substantiated by the evidence and here so I 'd like to do more work on it personally I think that it 's probably too late to take an amendment now that the resolution is that we retain the existing policy unchanged if fedders lost then we would review that aspect of it so it 's not I mean because at the moment it is that is it is the existing policy so i think they vote against this resolution and then we would decide to turn to review it so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so division oh ok okay so that 's carried so we 'll move on to the next item item 21 _"

    "text": "thank you we it was passed without much to sit and the I mean the plan it 's not it 's really good it 's obviously not perfect it be great to have off-road cycleways and things like that but for what is you know an industrial commercial area that it is it 's very good and we 're really pleased at how its developed I think both boards were but we 're concerned that develop the development has gone forward with the anticipation on having a lot of parking available and so we are staff both boards of our staff to have a look at other parking possibilities okay totally agree on page what I late and when we have the response to consultation there was some real issues there from the from the feedback from the submissions at the to find 114 car parking spaces and that 's why our boards have recommended on the bottom of page 113 that the board 's decided to request after further consider and report back to both boards on the provision of aw street parking options to offset a lot of on so this is what we 're stressing if we can possibly do that somehow mention was made of the of the Sarah building in that proximity as well and after its know once it was scared good yep sorry skirt so that 's one of the sort of things that was talked about is the possibility of from car parking becoming available there when them skirt has finished it anyway just just since then to Paul I 've had a call from a business person in the area he 's really concerned now that Birmingham drive and X perming him is gets gridlocked several times during the day I 've experienced myself it 's it 's an absolute nightmare getting out onto bedam road and to rights road at prison and he 's concerned that I 'm just reporting on a phone conversation I 've had call 16 it is an issue that we hope can be addressed looking forward after the some this road as some is built to try and improve traffic movements through that area in post won 't erase the important so ensure the council impact and cycleways have on business because this is this it seems to be that people think I that 's just it it 's for people who are completely unrelated to them and that that 's not going to bring people to their business but also that that understanding of the people who make deputations it on this was that it was booked taking people through and not to there so it 's not for taking people who are commuting past or people who enjoy riding or whatever rather than for taking people dear employees and their customers to them and I just it would be great if we could ever before the major cycleways really pick up if we could have an education campaign around the benefits of cycleways ok so the resolution that 's here is that the council approves Brandon Heath Kendrick Lamar Graham community board components of the preferred scheme design is that something that you want to move Phil and Vicki do you want to thicken there right so Yanni just a question really off the board sent to staff but in light of our of the other costs like we 're spinning team dollars and it 's quite a lot of money we 've got broken roads that we were considering flexing so have you thought about whether this project is essential right now or whether this is something that we could do in the future once we 've dealt with some of the more pressing earthquake I guess the first answer is yes it is an important project the end but you know I do that the general point around going through the capital program with a fine-tooth comb you know I totally support that but in this particular case it is very important for the growth and future of the ward to ensure that the that you deal with the traffic congestion and access to the business back there is a subsidy that we 're expecting on this one as well can we get a comment on there but just under five point three it talks about the high benefit cost ratio of 17 dennis has been further investigated so I 'll just like staff to kind of tell me what that come to the table and can you comment also on the expectation around the funding from NZTA park Germans project manager yeah the VCRs of benefit cost ratio it 's a standard financial measure defined by NZTA so the benefits are measured in terms of travel time reduction waiting time reduction at intersections primarily those are the benefits subside reduction in co2 admissions things like that and then the costs are the costs of us implementing the project so at the moment it 's got a strategy of leak it 's got its got an extremely high cost benefit cost ratio anything over one means benefits exceed the costs so I mean it 's saying that the benefits are sending times the cost of the project which we 're reviewing because we think it 's a little bit but I it 's much better than the roms sorry the question is is why why is it being reviewed house it 's exceptionally high compared to most of our projects so you so you think that there may be an error and benefactor it could be I mean typically a very so just taking on council your Hanson 's point about the review of our capital program which is really stepping up next week I 'm wondering whether this actually now has to be made subject to the deliberation on the LTP because all of the camera program is up for review and we 've undertaken to do that as a council and I 'm a little bit uncomfortable with you know I mean I know that you 're not asking us to sign off on the spin because you 've you 're asking us to approve the components of the preferred scheme design but actually there are financial implications of the spin and we don 't want people to be just kind of getting on with that if we 're going to make a decision not to proceed with this project any time in the near future this is on this year 's clear currently it 's Alicia 's planned right and you 're going to you 're going to get that underway and completed by the financial year end does it it 's known as it 's currently in is on the financial year sorry 22 million table towards the back but it 's not going to be it 's not going to be in my part of our 450 underspend so so this already had monies allocated and spent is so in 1516 it 's about 7.1 million and in 1617 about 1.1 million so a total of starting in 2013-14 a total of ten and a half million doors but this financial year is 2014 15 at the next financial year is when our LTP starts and if you 're saying that we are not reviewing anything that 's in the budget for next financial year and we 're not looking at priorities compared to I mean if we 're saying that things are off the agenda for not looking at in terms of the capital spending program then but but we have a 400 something million under speed and capital yes oh no actually gets stuff out there happening which people are desperately at that is this we don 't you know but I want to know is the 2 million dollars that 's allocated for this financial year close to so the remaining worker would happen this financial year is most the detailed design work and when does the funding application cocoon for the nzta and which year will that impact on because this is not a neat figure this is a graceful both this year and next financial year so there 's separate applications for each stage of the project so that an application for detail design it 's the next stage and then a separate application the following year for construction there is 22 perhaps rather than points if I may make them one is the key objective of this project was to try and manage the downstream impacts of the Woodrow modelo link which is being constructed so it 's a new arterial between the southwest yep and more simple parts of the city so that will create a lot more traffic through these routes yes what this this project is trying to address the second thing is Jane you may know more about it but as part of the review capital of you going on I I just heard this morning food is so mad amir i 'm just just want to point out that work has actually commenced on this that does doing the pile work as we speak so to be very very difficult to actually drop it so I 'm really concerned that if this they 're going to be a review of the budget process that this could drop off and we already agreed as a council that there would be a review of the capital program council Johansson asked the question about the priority attention to this and that is what we 're exploring so I 'm trying to get a handle on exactly what 's on the agenda and what 's off and but but now I 'm concerned that a staff member says that the planners are thinking of taking it off and I mean I knew my normal John what would be a logical post we 're just doing more work on a plan here what would be illogical pause time so in other words we 're not spending any more money because of this resolution is that right we 'd be going four or six months so I mean it could be pause now okay KITT I just say might be the construction that 's happening now is for a different well it 's a different project of bridge it 's for the bridge don 't think this is a this is a separate project that are highly linked to me yeah something with such a high I know it needs to be reviewed but it 's unlikely that it 's going to go down to you know but so that the cost-benefit ratio is really high we know that it 's there for positive and needed like the sort of things that need to be delaying and things with much lower cost benefit ratio is but I 'm all for having having a look in keeping the cost down but i think that the cost accounts are likely to be higher rather than lower by delaying this particular protein do you i think that council johansson raised the issue quite justifiably because we have a resolution on the box that says that we are undertaking a review of our capital spend some really interesting discussion about this and I I 'm actually going to suggest that and future council papers that come forward that have these financial implications really do need to have some analysis around we 're that sits in terms of the you know in terms of the that the review of the capital program I 'm you know I mean I 'm actually of the view that this this should proceed because what it doesn 't take into account and either this current financial year or the next financial year what more looking at the next financial year is the amount of NZT a subsidy so we 're looking at a gross hug I went when we know that the cost is not going to be 10.4 million it is going to be potentially just under half that amount so you know I just I kind of you know that that 's that 's the but that 's missing from from here and the sense that I mean although we 've got some comfort around the BCR but then we 're also being advised that it 's being high that might be wrong so but I mean I 'm hearing a lot of things that perhaps need to be in papers in the future because we can 't_''_928.02 be signing off on decisions that then impact on our ability to do the review of the capital program which we 've signed up to do but I 'm really quite comfortable with us this proceeding but I think counselors need to know that that means that we 're committing to the 2015-16 in 2016-17 spend as well also just note briefly that element our board you know it does have a list of capital projects that we think should be to food so it 's not simply this is a my ward so it 's important the high cost benefit ratio and and and a business park that is severely constrained in its growth I think it 's really important but there are a whole bunch of things in our world that could be delayed but this should be one of yeah there 's a an entire section of christchurch called the east which is operating on roads that down or to navigate streets with their mobile scooters you know the extent of damage and parts of our city have got to be addressed as well so we are we have a we have a serious serious set of decisions to be made and it 's not going to be an equal amount per award based on a ward location and help here at it and our submissions to date that we support the east getting more than us like we we agree they will don 't worry good you 've got that right yawning thank you I know there 's been a lot of work done on this project I just you know I think the designs fine so I mean I 'm happy to approve the design today but since it 's Friday we 're getting the new information around the capital review obviously we just need to think about what happens so i presume staff can just take that on board the comments that have been made and obviously see what happens next week and if we need to look at council reprioritizing the spin we should hold up the approval of the design today but can I just say I mean I just you know heard on the radio this morning this spring 's and people 's areas and Aranui for example for years on and pages road bridge all these projects and projects that we need to kind of understand the big picture you know I can tell you a story about the pages are all pretty much trying there is nothing to do with whether nzta can fund it right now execute you 've got major decisions to make around the residential red zone and we 've got major decisions to make about the location of roads new brighton roads of classic one you can 't make a decision about a permanent repair to a bridge until you know what 's happening on the other side but the e yes videos that 's not but we don 't know whether it 's going to be realigned don 't you know where it 's going to end up so there 's no point doing a permanent repair now that 's why it 's important temporary repair anyway anyway I just know so that you know I welcome us looking at a capital program and looking at the the the writing optimization and actually the NZTA stuff because ngt I don 't have unlimited money so it 's not we shouldn 't just assume that projects because they have a high bc r i will get into ta funding we know there 's a competition for funding amongst in GTA and it doesn 't actually matter if it qualifies it 's actually going through another process so yeah you know I just I 'm glad to these discussions of invited I 'm heavy to support design today recognizing we 've got another week to look like April work um Jimmy to ask a start to be clarified because this project was for four years in my right from the design here the construction and also if we review back to two years ago actually this project has been approved in the former council meeting but maybe the purest council already secured is budget and also lets year 2015 in 7.5 million dollars weather has been years ago and also this party has been called here for two years already if we review part budget regarding to list of project with review is a third in the first year again always reviewed a plastic whether need to go home or not this Mike regime so it 's been approved in the current three-year plane and the table for native table and the 5.1 and the three-year plan hearing seems to have moved a bit that table through the formatting so as I understand it this year is the final year of the current three year plan I mean the 2.2 million dollars already oh poo in the go-ahead you Wiz reviews that year demerit because next year is a third year of the three-year play pass three year plan regarding to this project already approved by the formal council meeting take 22 years ago am i right whatever is in the three-year plan has been approved can someone tell me yeah I thought three-year paint finishes this year either three-year plan finishes at the no that 's 2015-16 as the third year because it 's 2000 that was replaced with the with the L first year of the LTP the third year so the 1516 I don 't mean to look like I 'm doing that um the next year would be the third year of the three-year plan but it is the first year of the LTP so and I think that what counselor Johansson is quite rightly put on the table is that the consequences of the decision to review the capital program means that we are reviewing the whole of the capital speed but in making this decision today to go ahead with the design I think we 're going a step further in fact we 're pretty much taking this off the agenda for reconsideration but but my question series review we will review is we should review you know whether this project p honda parkway or show of the budget rather than we reveal whether this project has been approval not approve no no no it doesn 't matter whether it 's been approved that 's the point that yannis making you know it 's all bets are off we 're as a council to do as part of our commitment to seeing how we balance the the books for each year of the next ten years so that is that the work that we are doing behind the scenes while at the same time we 're consulting on our long-term plan we committed to the people of Christchurch that we would do that and the operational expenditure as being reviewed internally by the by the chief executive being led by the chief executive so but the thing that you 've pointed out is that the three-year plan reference on this is incorrect because it takes the third year out unto 2016-17 widget listen part of the three year plan period yeah that 's a formatting error that wasn 't originally how I have it right okay so that just goes bad for ya alright alright can I just had a quick point yep if if the council approves the scheme today but withdrawals this project from the capital program starting next year then we will either could make a start on detail design for the next two months or maybe if there was no Carol funding for it no but the thing that I 'm kind of saying is is that there 's no point spending 2 million dollars on a detailed design program if you 're not going to commit to the 7 million for the building of it so that two million was for the skin design and detail design now most of it was spent on the scheme design but I mean we 've only got two months left of the year right and if we know that this project is planned to come out of the LTP as being proposed by staff then we wouldn 't start detail design so we wouldn 't spend any more time or money on it it 's going to be very difficult and any capital review to take out something that has the benefit to cost ratio that this does this Ellen what this is a factor of a huge growth in this area may look just roads need changing I hate spending money on roads but I cannot deny that this workers needed anybody who 's used any of it will speak or know that so I mean we have this awful figure of a capital underspend we just need to get on and do stuff if we I mean even if that figure goes from 17 to 12 or seven it 's still going to be at the top of the priority works it 's a very very high benefit to costume hmm yep sorry oh well what do you need to add something to that I just want to point out Madame mayor and councillors that we 've already spent two million dollars what we 're actually looking at if we get the forty-eight percent subsidy that we 're probably looking about 32 min 3.2 million dollars was my very very very very rough calculation so when we 're talking about 10 million realistically we 're not but we sort of budgeting for that as a worst-case scenario so when we 're looking at reviewing the budget by the time you get to review your capital program you would be looking at the cost of this is about three or three and a half million dollars no made that point and we don 't know the answer by the end of june but anyway that i think that people are going to support this but i think counsel johansson is right to elude us to the process that we 've agreed that we 're going through and it 's going to be a big effort and everyone is going to have to you know play a serious role and making sure that we get that capital spin down but we we also we can 't we can 't you know pretend that reducing the capital program is going to solve our problems financially as a council and the reason that we can 't do that is because making a decision to defer a capital spin there ultimately will have to happen at some point may have flow on impacts on the topics in the meantime but it also may have it 's simply a deferring of a decision that has to be taken at a future stage it doesn 't reduce the council 's obligation to spend on a on an embedded basis which is where the paying interest and I hate paying interest it 's for the privilege of borrowing money the interest that we are paying I 've got the latest figures of how much they 're actually goes to you but it 's over a hundred million dollars a year just an interest and it just seems to be such a vast sum of money for the privilege of borrowing but I also agree with the you know the intergenerational equity arguments as well we can 't_''_1690.72 put the cost on this generation of ratepayers of something that has a benefit across generation so all of these considerations are coming into the consideration of the long-term plan and and this has you know sparked off that discussion but this is a serious reminder to everyone we 've got some hard work ahead of us and it isn 't simple and isn 't enough just to take things off our capital program so I 'll I 'm gonna put I 'm going to put the motion because it 's it I don 't know that it will assist has you said if we reveal you to take questions on the capital program yeah we 're not going to do this are you in relation to this I don 't know that this project is going to survive that review we 've made that decision really with this one so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and mike if you could stay at the table and turn to Clause 16 _"

    "text": "you know cotto Qatar yes these are pretty much a business-as-usual meeting I just maybe like p.m. mention a couple of other things that are happening in the ward levels on Mount here but recently had a by-election as you know and we 've last meeting not just one that 's got the report we welcomed our new board member dennis Aldridge and already he 's picking up some of the tasks that you know commutable members often do attending meetings of other organizations so that 's great boards a bit overwhelmed at the moment by all the consultation that 's going on with the LTP in the district plan review and the representation review and of course we 've got the littleton port recovery plan which is a big one for us because it 's feels like it 's our one big chance to achieve some of the things that we 've long hoped for with connecting littleton whether it 's more for front again we we had a we win on monday with agreement from een to do some quality monitoring we 've been this community concern about through the the community and they 're going to do some monitoring of PM 2.5 for for the next year for you so the only other thing that i would mention in our report was item 2.1 where we had a deputation and some correspondence from federal or cucaracha about the pequeninos owing a zoning and we 've been advised by staff that in fact what they 've request request it is already in the proposed district clean as it 's coming from city so here we had a discussion at the district plan review committee year then the open session the other day and that checked has been completely rewritten and conjunction was the bruna the various Runanga that have submitted on it so i think that the way it 's looking now is much much better but i encourage you to go ahead with the workshop because i think getting an understanding of what the public hangers own came mean for local community is within your grow here I think were really really important so it might even be worthwhile having it as a joint one and and boards who might be interested because that 's a it 's a very it 's a great opportunity to utilize land Marty lien for the development of of housing and in a way that 's kind of really respectful of the off the land and our relationship with Marty so that okay yeah so I 'd certainly encourage you to go ahead with that are there any questions Johnny um the thing that sticks up for me is 5,000 people living in that area so just turn to their registered to Brian to the Runanga they 're descended from the real allison is only about lab night probably least 100 living yes that was gonna be my question just in terms of the existing infrastructure and that does end a number i know that 's the number of people registered but obviously you wouldn 't see that many build but do you have any sense from the infrastructure that 's currently in place what I could cope worth in terms of new new sections being developed I don 't think the instructor existing infrastructure could although we 've got you is a community I mean their own mirai is public gathering space one of the things that we are aware of when we closed the for shal road which isn 't that that report hasn 't come here but recently there was a batch on on for legal road which we 've asked to be removed and there 's a development proposal that the runo already has and the removal of the batch on the m4 legal road will enable the development of three residential units which are going to be as I understand it holiday homes that members of the ruining I can reach so that they they 're not thinking about building permanent homes at the stage he 'll be a sort of to know and the end we will advise that these would also be available outside that time for for other people using a not part of the ruling us so I don 't think they 've got a grand vision and just because the land is in public hangers owing showing doesn 't necessarily mean that it 's actually owned by the Runanga or even so I just thought through that workshop like if you take the context of the money that 's being spent on Victoria Square which we told us you know some of it for cold jaani jaani jaani it 's not money that we 're allocating under our budget if you give the infrastructure only what I was trying to make is I support the development of these pop accountants office own I 'm just worried that our long-term plan or our capital budgets haven 't thought through what infrastructure we might put in to support it when we 're dancing up we 're also going through a district plan review process which has you know completely rewritten as I see the cover clang of zoning provisions and we do need to understand the implications of those in terms of any decisions but that 's not going to be made before this long-term plan is lot done because this district plan will not be in place until next year so you know it may be in an annual planning process that that will be picked up but it actually is more at an LTP that workshop which I 've certainly love to attend does is he going to be you need any advice around the infrastructure because I think it 's important to get that on the table earlier if we 're aware of it yeah but if excellent if they haven 't gotten any specific plans now and the zoning isn 't changing until next year i think my my and I think if you 're if you have a property that you 're still going to have to go through the normal process of applying for consent and everything like that we 're those sorts of things get to see so I mean I 'm a bit vague about educate all the applications of it but yeah but i think is right while how do i need okay maybe a more general a general workshop rather than the specifics on that particular site i mean one of the things that i personally think would be good would be to have a kind of development plan for each Bruno where they kind of set out what the vision is for thing and that enables the consenting process to be simplified yeah and gives the Runanga more power to design a community that meets their own needs and which will contribute to the fantastic diversity of communities that we 've got on big splinter which is one of our great things very well put thanks oh and I assumed that Andrew Turner would like to move and Phil Clearwater would like to second that the report be received i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed i know that 's carried thanks thank you very much _"

hope anything right Greggy thank you my name is joy low in my husband and I live within 50 meters of victoria street we left the in the city during our working life and the country we purchased a townhouse in the city which we affectionately call dare and used as their holiday home this gave us more enjoyment than any big chairs they made us realize we could never live in the suburbs we have since built our inner-city retirement home and have been full-time residents for eight years and have rejoiced in the buzz of city living victoria street was a delightful restaurant area until the earthquakes we also hit a post office medical center pharmacy convenience store freak shop and other retail outlets not forgetting the best fishing trip shop and cry street we have few of these amenities now and cannot see any made public its desire for more inner city residents we suggest that the council listens to the existing residents and what does and does not make in the city living desirable we are the people who live behind the earthquake cordon we had no assistance from Red Cross student volunteers or even the support of our own call their families but we stayed stoic and the belief that our neighborhood would once again be a great place to live at the present time Victoria Street is turning into a replacement for the quake destroyed in the city stroke every new office development includes ground Thor hospitality space but what we need is post of us we need rubbish bins and we it 's not that we the district and wrenches we love the vibrancy of the inner city but it needs to be vibrant in the daytime as well as at night we would just like Council to consider their credits and me plainly thank you thank you very much and Maureen Thompson morning everybody is also got to talk about the LA p so I also decided to talk joy was going to say so sorry if I repeat things many years ago I used to be an au pair girl living in Paris and I used to just love the fact that the woman that I lived with wig down and got her bread and her cheese and her groceries and all on foot and i found the victoria neighborhood area which was exactly the same used to pop down get my cheers from the cheesemonger breed from vic 's which is the only place that you can still go to get anything nowadays and you could go and look at the little carpet shop there were art galleries there are all sorts of amazing things happening in the area so now we have the most densely populated residential area and Christchurch and the Victoria area and here we have nothing except for vex which is the only place where you can actually go and get in your real food the place has become a victoria street in particular has become a place that has descended on by the 22 or the 20 year old age group just we 've even heard of things like I maybe will close off the streets so it can become even though you know more of a mayhem on saturday friday and thursday nights so yeah I would love the council to provide incentives for some small businesses to set up a post office a grocery store there was talk of a supermarket going in near the Briscoes site big sign went up and then we went down again so I don 't know what 's happening there currently our nearest supermarket is South City well I don 't know if you 've ever tried to cycle down the one-way street of Durham street just an absolute nightmare the cycle lane just disappears about 10 times and then you have to go down the middle with cars on the other side when you sort of get near the restart Lord it 's absolutely petrifying so you know I did we all try to cycle everywhere if we can the other thing that I used to do was I 'd volunteer usher down at the court theatre and so I be walking around five or six women on their own and we do like to wander around town on our own at night I want that area to be safe that when i come home at eleven o 'clock i can walk up montreal and victoria street on my way home all i want to see as a light buzz of activity i don 't want the mayhem of thousands of thousands of students creating you know vomit and urine and rubbish so we need pedestrian crossings on on that street we need better defined cycle lanes at the moment the paint sworn off on victoria street you can 't see the painters all on the run the cycle markings and we just love some normal little shops and places you know where people can actually live a normal life that way you 're going to get your 200,000 visitors residents moving into the city and when they come and talk to me they 're not going to say oh don 't really want to move into the city they go oh yeah yes fantastic which they used to do so please some of vacant spaces left in Victoria Street the failed contain a corner that hasn 't gone very well that become a place with maybe a little Tim Cook bread shop chemist I don 't know how you did incentivize people to do it but that there are just a few spaces left yes it 's for just some little corner stores but I don 't have to be cheap enough for them to afford it thank you very much thank you right the next item on the agenda is deputations by appointment and we have one deputation representatives from the Mount Pleasant residents association regarding item 5 and item 40 a community organization loan fund request and we will deal with the deck report straight after the presentation so thank you _"

    "text": "as part of the public through public participation standing order three point 19 the public forum I 'm advised that at the previous meeting of the council redcliffe school were provided with an opportunity to use this at this meeting today to make a presentation so I would like to invite come Alexander and I think Mark Roberts as well to come forward and to present to the council good morning morning morning man thank you for allowing us to come and speak today yes we did come along a couple of weeks ago and spoke and the mirror in the chair we came to speak very briefly about the situation with redcliffe school which as you know is relocated at vanished deaf education center currently and recently we have had a proposal from the Minister for education are to close the school and we have until the first of July to make submissions on that and we have come to ask the council to also make a submission in support of reckless school returning to its cool site in remaining open into the future just in addition to that the Ministry of Education delivered by omwh which basically comes up with a safety plan for the school which gives it a background safety level of one in a million and your life risk which compares quite favorably to the Green Zone house in 1 in 10,000 and your life risk so in other words the background risk on the school side at the moment it 's the same as us sitting in this chamber here it 's the same as the life risk to anyone at anywhere in New Zealand so that 's just one of the points we 'd like to get across the minister has acknowledged that in her education report and administrative acknowledged that but the reason that they 've given is potential disruption to education in the future and we believe would the advice we have had in the past few weeks that this potential disruption is a very solvable issue to deal with the design of the mitigation that would go in place and also to do with the actual potential for that disruption to take place so these are things that we 're would encourage the council to work along with us in that regard in terms of any planning to that mitigation and councillors yani johansson and paul lonsdale have met with us and we would like to work collaboratively to assist them in writing a submission on behalf of the council in the two minutes 18 seconds of gotland is there any chance to field any questions from the counselors I just want to kind of thumb tease out in terms of our contribution to a submission on it I think that where the council would be able to add value to a submission process would be that we have access to you know the expert staff who have analyzed the the hill sites in their area who have worked collaboratively with other engineers and I don 't know whether mwh or and that mix as well but I presume so because there was a whole portholes group on geotechnical engineers that actually worked quite collaboratively right across the ball in terms of the universities as well so from a scientific research and practical engineering approach I think we have a them probably any other area of New Zealand and that that mapping process has given us a better understanding of what the potential future risks are the life Brusco shoes we 've dealt with them as far as the district plan goes and ways that you know sort of discourage further building in particular areas so I think that what I 'd quite like to do is to kind of make and make an offer that we open up our expertise as a council to support the community to make a submission and in that regard it 's we 're offering the technical support I mean obviously the moral support comes from your your local councillors right so what will be the point of contact for taking up your offer of that support well I think that will lead that with the chief executive to to decide how that would would work but I mean as I say we 've got a is a port hills geotechnical team which we could really make available to support the community so I use this thing that that would be an addition to a way it says well is because obviously our submission couldn 't be absent the technical advice i mean you know i mean it 's it 's a hugely challenging issue and you know my mistake we 're aware of that and and that 's forms of the bulk of our submission is around that those technical issues as well yeah yani drafted a resolution but i think we do have a working sorry are we rock for subcommittee has been the governance level looking at things around risk and I think it may be appropriate that that committee just gets together and we row as well I just had a draft resolution that um says that the council make as much in support of school returning to its home and that councillors lonsdale in your hands and work with the school representatives on the draft submission to redevelop for council approval so obviously the submission will come back yeah I kind of you know don 't really want us to to start from a position on without the without the background report I actually want to see what the it is so I 'm you know I mean I 've had conversations with various people but I kind of want to take a degree of comfort we 're talking about a school with you know I mean children we 're playing on the day when when they 're rock full rock face basically collapsed in front of them so I just want to know what I want to see what the technical advisers I haven 't seen the minister 's report for example and so I don 't want to start from that position I want to start from the position that we want to support the community with all of the technical advice that we have available to us so that we can then both support the community but also to develop our own submission so I sorry I 'm not aware of who 's on the rockfall subcommittee generally the poor health counselors so the ones that are affected by rock roll cliff collapse yeah and it 's been very successful working through those individual rock protection structures there 's a cross collaboration of council staff from I felt it was I was doing something very similar to know what we may need to do in terms of our submission yeah it was just doing on an individual basis yeah so well I mean that that 's that there 's perfectly acceptable that they that the subcommittee work with the local community yep quick question you mentioned the risk of just disruption being or formulating or being a big part of that definition as far as the risk that the ministry is identify how different is the risk of disruption to education to the education provision to the risk of any other school is that sits now anywhere else in the city yeah that 's a very good point and that 's something that hasn 't been quantified and its really somewhere we don 't want to go looking at relative risks with different schools around the around the whole country really but from what you said one could surmise actually that that risk is the same as it is for any other school in the city yeah one could assume are so right yes the safety our school is away from potential rock fall show that it 's one in a million fatality risk which is much higher than what we 're people love much lower sorry much lower than where people live in possibly we are other schools and public places may be located not just in christchurch but throughout New Zealand it 's not a can that of worms that I think the Ministry on drivin yeah yeah so um I yeah so I 'm I 'm just trying to work here so so a because it is with while having a resolution on the books so that the Christchurch City Council provide all technical reports and advice that we have to support the schools its analysis of potential disruption really because we already have a peer-reviewed report that declares a slight safe it 's really around the issue of future disruption and and design well solution what well there may be maybe we can yeah because that may but may not be stuff that we already have it may not be accessible so so advice that we have on hand no give them don 't know I 'm not quite sure I think just making those resources available to us well for help because they 're still resources that are needed to answer that question yeah they 're still geotechnical questions that need to be answered okay that we will provide all all technical support and advice that we can to support the school developing at submission and that the council itself will prepare a submission through through the rockfall subcommittee yep thanks very much so so that that

's a there 's a whole lot of things that yeah yeah it 's not ideal but various things got put on people 's Diaries that is just can 't shift all right so how we goin watch which is next well the future urban development here is to be clear that its proposed that they are sound is really cleaning methods yes yep so that recommendation that you 've just exception yeah so to be clear that means to rezone either what were the future urban development areas to visit through neighborhoods and sorry what sorry outside anyway and I 'm gonna now lost myself completely page 109 of the spiral by Kane yep that talks about the very bottom of it talks about future urban development here yeah what what we suggesting is that all of those areas on the right they are going to be part of a future urban development zone now simply be raised owned immediately as this visitor your neighborhood enables oh yeah well I don 't don 't have that information and some thousands and currently and we 're razon another the issue the issue here is whether they are already signaled for development they already have geotechnical advice all the technical assessments they are certainly that they will be able to be serviced by public infrastructure within 20 years they 're they 're identified as what they are needed to 20 28 or beyond slightly beyond so they the reason they were held back from being zoned was you know they were probably or some of the so they were sort of kept in this future of a development based on I suppose long-term infrastructure provision but you know infrastructure programs do change even when you remodel these areas where they do the wastewater remodeling they find capacity that on that as grounds to you know stop them from being you know zoned residential your neighborhoods is not considered you know strong enough grounds to you know not enable them to be developed as at least the act of rezoning them so if they 're ready to go be razon we see there should be rezone the two questions I have on this are one what impact does this have on people living coming to live in the central city until given our financial situation I would have thought this a huge uncertainty about the infrastructure in fact one of the things we 're doing is reviewing our infrastructure speed because we certainly can 't afford it so how on earth can we afford to commit 2.4 which is providing the development you in requiring previous public infrastructure okay these are already identified required to meet the household targets for you know you know 20 28 and beyond you know it will be beyond as well the issue was yeah it 's our decision around the capital works program it sound a certain around the long-term plan after consultation with our community so we 're out there seeking views at the moment as to what you know our priorities ought to be and there will be people that think we ought to put priority into making sure that land use is available and you know I mean by zoning it it means that the decision isn 't made that we are going to provide the infrastructure for its right a winner through well we 're going to have to make that decision associated with when we when that developments going to occur I just ask the point of today 's meeting is not to read I know and I 'm already agreed I really drive and I think I know something very good about that the staffs recommendation is to move forward yeah simple as that yeah and your recommendation that 's definitely that we go straight to zoning them rather than creating a future urban development zone and it makes absolute sense to do that now rather than create a future urban development zone which gets activated as a residential zone at some stage and the Philly through a plan change probably through a plan change so let 's just do it in one fell swoop fright well the country sorry just before you move off there can I just obvious have my vote recorded against and also just have a response in terms of our urban development strategy my understanding is we have very clear targets around the percentage of Greenfield versus brownfield development and this will be contrary to that why don 't know it is entirely within the context of the years and the ll the loop the land use recovery plan has got specific areas identified and we are simply giving a bit of it rather than our stage planning it you we 're going to do it a staged approach we are now going to we 're sort of getting out of the with zoning it and the it 's the zoning that 's the problem or whether it 's the various other causes say we shall see so so so this is just one that you you just want your vote recorded against is there anyone else that 's kind of in that space so if we just make a note that yannis yeah I mean we 'll have to get a full list from you Yanni about the ones that you 're recording your vote against right next so in light of this approach to resign all grateful priority areas just making known seduced it we can make it clearer the fact that we 're rezoning all of them as a policy approach to enable the land use development and really to provide the direction of the development and the room review of councils long team plane and I 've just included some some words here because the point was is that it isn 't the act of Zoning that leads to an efficient use of them stronger and if a long-term plan that is how you deal with efficient use of infrastructure yeah I the other object you know they talked about it and the higher level objectives you know that would not we are going to achieve efficient use of infrastructure but they never there 's no policy that she sees how you 're going to do that and how you do that sir when complete I just wanted to suggest it make we can make that here yep no that 's good thank you Tim I think you could think to do with bass yeah and you want to rename East Belfast Oh is southeast hey some of you what would be confusing very good and then we get to oh do you did our which hear what I was away I we haven 't hundred what the egg 215 well I think a gig in that sounds like he 's that 's not doesn 't it Jimmy yeah we better leave they don 't want to do that one and we have stone okay I 've done we 've done page 117 so next one is page 108 recommendations nine and ten 118 recommendation 109 and 110 that seemed straightforward yep relating to the proposed crampton basement that we 've put that one off every way it 's all for Rick for residential apart from those ones that we 're putting forward to another day which is Ricky a race course oh it 's here ok good i 'm living in 2 112 rural that first one looks pretty straightforward yep and we 've dealt with lift out with 113 yes so we 're over 214 I 'm Pam on for on page 130 that 's just improving some definitions and clarity is highlighted by minister 's comments yep straight forward inhale Rock forward recommendation 115 you know once again it 's connected to the fact that the minister commented about the rural chapter being reconsidered in light of the strategic direction decision and so as a result of that as mentioned previously I have undertaken a thorough review and response to those comments removing as mentioned terminology improving objectives and policies so there are a lot tighter in just in terms of the original intention to add to strategic directions to make sure by removing those that we weren 't 's the review of the chapter just and improving cross-referencing eras removing duplicate references to other chapters and just basically having another good look at the chapter young relation to those comments recommendation 116 this is the rori sign that was the they work here they will comment specifically relating to whoring once again so how did you want to do something brave did deal with some of those permitted activity so I thought we had a pretty good discussion about that previously but that 's nothing Linda we lost a lot more permissive sorry 11 30 30 right one for three so that 's under one me 133 just the 123 for fourth kind of dish all right okay my fertility status has changed yeah if you look at page 143 and a recommendation 11 d I 've actually expanded on that discussion 3 143 what recommendation 118 so the ministers come into the down effect that and the operative banks peninsula plan there are a number of controlled activities some of those are being dealt with by the generals Royals chapters so that essentially left plantation forestry over a residential dwelling on a basically a one hectare site however that dwelling can only get to be established on a small site we had has been created through a particular subdivision rule and the original proposal that have brought to you previously was because we 're not yet at this point having controlled activities in the plan it was elevated to restricted discretionary however in light of the minister 's comments i reconsidered that and have reduced that to a permitted activity status now this is only the land-use aspect of it so this is the ability to establish a residential dwelling on a site that as one hectare that has already gone through a subdivision process which is has a restricted discretionary activity status so in other words this dwelling cannot be established on a small site unless it 's been created by subdivision so in other words we will have already had the best opportunity to deal with issues relating to the siting of the building because they need to identify building platform protection of the balance of the land against any further subdivision so in light to then create another consent process to deal with issues that actually we 've already dealt with at subdivision and adequately dealt with it subdivision so therefore any dwelling would still need to meet height and you know reflectivity requirements as per just establishing and dwelling on a normal 40 hectare site so that 's the reasoning behind it I cheves the exact same outcome yep is currently intended by the plan yep that was the the way that I read that for that reason I didn 't have a concern about it but since we 're discussing the 143 paper 143 144 item in the context of the issue that Jonnie raised the one area of this that I did want some clarification on was the box on the right hand side of page 144 sorry what look was jumping right ahead now so unless we 're saying that we 're taking off all of the ones before we get to 144 143 was raised in the Congress I know it was but there was a jump ahead you know based on explaining what was being raised which was generally were generally comfortable with the 133 page 134 page 135 136 and then we come down to recommendation 116 and that goes over to 138 and it was very straight and that was related to previous and that is the chorion quarry owned yep so all the provisions under that recommendation like to Corrine wisdom and so and it will take into account any decisions we made area yes yes and they were up to recommendation 117 page 114 a on page 142 is okay so okay so then we 've got ya okay recommendation 117 then we 've got the Emergency Services facility that 's all good 118 so as this where we 're getting to now this was your point Andrew yeah this is the one that I was wanting to refer to and again in the context of the discussion that we 've already had about places 133 134 in the hundred hectare example in the middle column point B that hundred hectare would have already gone through a subdivision one hectare would become the residential lot and the remaining 99 hectares would remain fully rural on it to say no further subdivision or dwelling developed that may also involve protection of any landscape features or biodiversity features as well so yes it will be retained as in rural productive use great so that was the reason I was comfortable with the 133 134 issue but the question that I 've got in the right-hand column you 've got p7 residential activity this is on page 14 for the site containing residential units shall have a minimum net site area of either 40 hectares below the 160 me to come to 100 hectares above the 160 me to contour or 1 hectare where the site has been created under Rule 8.3 point 1.1 now does that indicate and if it does I 'll be happening that that one hectare would then have at least 39 hectares alongside it that was covenant add in any case what could it be a subdivision of one hectare residential title of one hectare with a smaller than 39 hectic and covenanted area by the side of it no no so so your original the comments on it are correct so so you can have it on 40 hectares or a hundred and we 're not going to require any further consents or the one hectare site that 's been created under the subdivision rule so the intention of that is the dwellings being created being us located on the one hectare site so the balance will have been protected under that subdivision so there 's no question about establishing a dwelling or net and some balance below 160 metre contour would always be at least thirty nine hectares and the balance above 160 metre contour would always be at least 99 hectares is great in which case happy with it thank you right recommendation 119 that 's right forward 120 we 're producing those newsletters that 's very good yep they 're all aren 't straight through and appendices yeah and sure duplication that 's all straight forward then we 're on to open space through you madam chair modest request that we go back to the general rules and procedures chapter to deal with the noise rules because we have here our expert who has had input into those time okay i 'm just so that means we would go back to I 'm nervous about time so I think we 're going to have to is there anything else that I 'm going to do there will do the noise ones but is there anything else that we have to do today because I know unless I mean the only main credit critical one that you haven 't gone is the mail site but we could do that on Wednesday do that separately so let 's do the noise one swap Paige but Paige brigitte 54 page 54 so that starts at recommendation 24 yeah put in 25 and 26 are fairly straightforward yes I think 24 is very straightforward this is 25 25 is just dumb tidying up some wording to make a little clearer it 's not fundamentally changing anything 26 um why would you reduce noise attenuation of the sort well man seen in the frequency this is it at 25 yeah a noise attenuation of the source is essentially imposing levels on your level imposing limitations on your level it 's sort of repeating take it out okay and what about the frequency the reason I 've recommended taking out word frequency is that from an acoustic point of view it has two meanings it can mean how often it happens it can also mean whether it 's bass or treble low frequency high 50 so it 's a really bad word to use in a noisy room so I 've proposed level location and duration which really from a technical point of view sums up all you need to know about yes I understand why you take another word frequency and you know it makes sense but but um there needs to be something else in there I 've got there 's 160 noise complaints for one address yep so it 's the repetitive nature repeated so it 's not the duration but it 's the number of comply that drives people crazy having to you know deal with this noise every every retired so but aren 't they to do some different things we 're talking about a noisy activity whereas that we are talking about our party has I 'm just know repeatedly which drives people Betty but I thought it was I thought it was a neck it was a property a residential property or a temporary residential property it 's a residential property but yeah but that 's not what this brawls designed for this rules designed for noisy factories in noisy businesses and and actually while we 're out at bunnings you know where they put the the loading zone right by right by the residential even though that wasn 't on the original agreement and they drive people nuts every Saturday afternoon or gay like so yeah you know I think they 're different name recognition of the of the makati easily frequency but if if the noise is happening you know repeatedly it actually has a cumulative effect on someone right I totally hear what you 're saying but I think the noise rules as they 're written actually don 't address parties that under a dress that stuff that 's dealt with on a more of a section 16 bases it 's a nuisance problem and you dress that quite separately not within these rules rules are really about the sorts of things that you need a consent for now you don 't need a consent to hold a party at your house therefore the noise rules don 't maybe that should be the rule we impose on them maybe a no better reason your neighborhood or adjacent to a residential neighborhood we do have to work it out from a from it from a different yeah um a different perspective I mean the things I said I mean up the only thing that I think in it there is nothing about the about the posse that is objectionable and in my view that 's just it is the example that I gave of a of a noisy activity which wasn 't going to be facing a residential development and the change was made without any consultation with anyone and and as a result you know the amenities just destroyed every set it afternoon and Sunday now I would have thought time and I might be wrong but it was still important especially for example residential areas around supermarkets or where supermarkets are going to then pushing the boundaries on that that sort of an ongoing complaint often yes I think it 's fair to say that if you look at this this is this is a policy on what we 're trying to achieve through the rules the rules don 't actually tell you how often you can do something they don 't tell you what time of day per se they tell you how noisy you can be at various times a day so they actually restrict the level of noise they restrict the location that you can do it next they restrict the duration in terms of whether it 's daytime or nighttime noise rules don 't tell you that you can only do it one hour a day or two times a month nor nor would they ever in terms of putting a loading dock next to a residential area you know that 's that 's either going to meet the noise rules and be be permitted with respect to noise all you 're going to need to go through a resource consent process fortunately they breach their resource consent and 's that that example and I 'm fairly sure a note when you 're talking about mation right have motions robux yes we 're involved with her not happy that I 'm am involved with it actually well if you could fix it be great oh yes they 're my neighbors around here remember I love around they 're not not next door but I 'm not conflicted in any way I do shop I do shop there okay but I never used the loading zone area yeah did but that is an example where it 's actually a breach of st. conditions yeah that 's not the fault of the noise rules that that problem has occurred yeah orite is that all I think on 25 that 's Bob Ewell anything else oh well just flipping through the rest of 26 again it 's it 's cleaning up I wasn 't happy with where they how to use the rules section is supposed to be easy to understand and in my view it was so complicated you couldn 't understand the how to use the rules therefore you 're wording sort of just dropped in beyond me it 's just a clarification that 27 is to do with Littleton the issue that arose did you deal with the wood grammar I feel once what did they keep deal with thing I we haven 't_''_1761.35 we 've put that aside you put it aside so that includes the that 's I am I came right thank you yep sorry I 'm out here 27 the the concern here was that the noise rules that we 've proposed for the commercial banks peninsula zone is more stringent than than what was previously there it 's not actually previously we had two different rules for the same zone there was one rule that applied in the middle to the town center the other rule that applied everywhere else the rule I 've proposed is actually more lean slightly more lenient for everywhere else it 's more stringent for Littleton because the previous rule was actually nonsense the previous rule you could never ever have any residential accommodation of any description within the Littleton town center if people actually produce the amount of or apartments or residential secondly the previous rule it was such that nobody could ever make use of it anyway because it nominally allowed a lot of noise within the town center but because the town center is so small you 're always restricted by the residential area around it though the proposed rules I believe are much more appropriate for the way that Littleton town center functions but what I am proposing is an exemption on people noise and outdoor areas which is something that we 've recently implemented in that christchurch central city which really is much more enabling in terms of cafes and restaurants and the likes which have previously had difficulty meeting the noise walls as soon as you put people outside so this allows for people to be exempted from the noise rules during daytime hours so that would be up to ten o 'clock at night at 28 is so this comes back in some way to the comments I made around alcohol licensing for Middleton as well so if I can just clarify the proposal under office of reasons is more stringent than yes so it 's more restrictive the status quo yes it is because I mean as as someone who has lived in Littleton for many years and has run businesses in Middleton for many years including the type of business you 're referring to here I 'm not aware of huge problems with noise in little town it seems as though we 're possibly solving a problem that doesn 't exist and given the little sins future economic development may well be and again as identified in Littleton master plan may well be around hospitality and entertainment including later night hospitality and entertainment it may be that this is going to stand in the way of some things that otherwise might naturally happen here that would be supported by people who after all a residents that are living within in some part a mixed zone so a mixed residential commercial zone which is different to zoning in the sitting or people that are living in a residential zone knowing full well that there within very easy earshot of a commercial zone which has got hospitality businesses in it right _"

    "text": "I totally agree there haven 't been a lot of noise problems in Littleton town center what that says to me is that nobody 's actually been making as much noise as they 're being permitted to make because if they were would had noise problems to give it a context that current noise regime is 65 DB limit 24 hours a day which is the same as our entertainment one category in the central city which is designed for 24-hour entertainment and in that area you 're not allowed to build residential what 's it because it was a week in port no I don 't believe it is I don 't_''_36.09 I don 't know why it 's come about it 's it 's a rule that 's really only appropriate if you want hospitality at the expense of everything else if you never want anything else in the town center then it 's a perfectly fine rule but it is a working port and I think that 's why they 've always had indeed but the port only produces maybe 50 decibels at the same area that it doesn 't I haven 't found any good reason why it would be the way it is it is currently the most permissive noise own in maybe they wouldn 't cost you maybe they want a 24-7 license area as well and they could be the only one in town well I mean that might go further than i would suggest you would go about i mean there are some discussions will have a will get onto that as well but so they 'd never make it back through the tunnel yes I do yeah oh yeah my little son is quite different than other similar areas and I think the way that Littleton will develop his economic development will perhaps be quite different than some other areas as well it 's interesting to know the relationship between town center noise and port noise when some noise testing was done in Littleton recently the background port noise on a saturday night was found to be significantly greater than the noise produced by town center venues on a Saturday night and I mean that 's with live bands at the outdoor courtyards which well used so I mean my point is that for as long as I 've been there currently the status quo has worked and I wouldn 't want to change it to something more restrictive that stopped it working in a way that actually is quite unique and works really well for Littleton right it 's can we put a pause on the air cuz but we 'll have to find another time we 're past the time and I we 've either got meetings to go to so but but give it give it some thought on that area because you know if there isn 't a problem we don 't really want to be fixing up and I 'm not proposing to fix a problem I 'm no I 'm saying that then the problem doesn 't you 've been asked to look at whether the plans internally consistent and it doesn 't look internally consistent when there are this set of rules that wouldn 't be acceptable anywhere else except for an a high volume you know entertainment area yeah yeah there 's true yeah reap rebuild the British that 's what I say right oh sorry I apologize we adjourn the meeting until a time to be advised by and project _"

    "text": "just make sure that that 's for recommendation 90 on page 96 be a recommendation 90 page 96 delete the delete small numeral three yep yep recommendation 91 oh sorry yes c3 3.37 c3 I mean the next one which is about the it 's just a rewording of the port hills policy it 's not substantive it still has the same intent as previously it 's just no recommendation 92 93 and 94 quick guys you 've done those yeah yeah yeah it 's not as far away from me so come and sit up here okay so where to next in our recommendation 95 and 96 on page 195 over 96 they 're all good yep no straightforward 97 father that is a change because legally we couldn 't make any change to state 1 properties that were notified and zoned for stage 1 sorry say that again at 97 there we had proposed an accommodation and community facilities own we cannot propose it because some of the properties that were affected by that zone we had already been zoned under stage 1 and because we can 't either consider not including next own and providing for or recognizing you know guest accommodation and high level sort of larger scale community facilities down those corridors so we 've had to change the approach and introduce it as a accommodation community facilities over the LA and it 's not ideal but we accept that it as does make the rules over complex but that 's legally just what we had to do because some of the properties that we had proposed to be located in this accommodation community facilities own were already zoned as part of stage one and you cannot make a change to stage one yeah yep recommendation 98 um so we can 't really make this change because the minister hasn 't specifically directed so this isn 't removing rules extend or prescriptive math this is actually I 'm doing something different so how can we do that the minister 's comments because he asked us to in an overarching way to make sure that it was internally consistent yep he 's it look like when it basically it sees here here are all of the but so don 't regardless as the final word on the matter go through and make sure that what you notify doesn 't duplicate and in by simplifying any policies and rules that overlap yeah well this this would have been rules that overlapped was stage one if it had you can 't have one zoning on top of another zoning so I wanted to use an overlay mechanism so we can highlight that when we notify can 't_''_279.59 we hi license will highlight up to the hearings panel when we get to giving evidence you know that that 's the reason where you changed it to an overlay if it 's that 's necessary can 't_''_291.169 do that within a recommendation we could do it do it through events of submission yeah but in terms of public right so when I 'm talking to the people that don 't like these motels and these travelers accommodations and you know there 's record and Brian or be liev if I 'm saying to them just in like one sentence what we 're doing what do I tell them in terms between stage 1 and stage 2 policies and rot world rules really right stage 1 it was already zoned was it some type of what was that on stage on some public residential some of the properties were zoned and predominantly well mix of residential suburban and residential medium density right so if I say to people if you don 't want these to change it to motel zones then make a submission saying you want the retaining step existing know the zoning is there it 's all realized through stage one this is just including an overlay over the top of it yeah no delay needs is some additional rules to give you greater development rights right so people should have posed the overlay if they don 't want more much that 's right that 's right yep taking I mean if we didn 't include the overlay yes the overlay is going to go over I 've got some of the gifts of combination sewing as well no no the guest accommodation zone because some of these corridors had guest accommodations but aren 't they in the central is in the central city these are just the corridors along pepino erode really avenue and rapini area yep probably the most with this is allowing for community facilities with a minimum building size of 350 square meters as opposed to 200 square meters in the residential suburban zone so a long record term road some of those sites that interspersed between a hotel and motel they would have what we 're saying is that instead of a community facility of 200 square meters which they could do under the resident of Cebu Mazzone you can build something is permitted activity up to 350 now i will say that there through the stage one there 's actually been a shift to allow for greater scaled community facilities as of right under the residential suburban zone anyway scale with the size of building as a permitted activity city for healthcare residential recommendation 98 that 's pretty straight forward straight forward and then we 've got all of these statement of expectations or this is where we need to take you through this is a quite a big change that we 're so the background to this the loving g 'zone at the through the draft and the consistent feedback from the large block developers was that they wanted to retain the living g 'zone because they were developing and accordance with that and where you know had planed their development based on those provisions so what we had done is just converted those and into the new plan for met at least we could some of them were that conflicts but and had proposed that so that was what we proposed for the draft there 's been and significant comment for the minister 's comments kept the number of zones the complexity of zones and you know certainly with this residential we called the old living g residential establish new neighborhoods was confusing and they also questioned you know where we were proposing a future human development zone residency new neighborhoods own resident to establish new neighborhood zone and then there were all the other remaining zones residential suburban transition density so that in medium density and it was originally through stage one there was some attempt to try and integrate it was abandoned i guess at that point because it was quite complex with picked that up again and as a means to rationalize the zones made a an attempt and reintegrate the living Jesus are looking at what is most important to retain through those living G zones provisions and carry those through and integrate them with the residential new neighborhood zones there was a lot of concern that there is an interview neighborhood so provisions its proposed under stage one would be an impediment to the development of the sites of the Living G sites this is the wig room of the Preston 's the East Belfast and high-speed our tier women in the old whose mission so we 've done some theory over the last week and very quick analysis and we do not consider that they would be and Peter than any major way by their resident to new neighborhood provisions we do any concerns that they have about the residential neighborhood provisions we trust will be resolved through the stage one hearings such that any issues of the application through a lot of these living can be resolved none the least we are suggesting that we retain some of the skies the applicability of the residential neighborhoods own provisions are a little but may impede the development of the density a areas in the loving jeez now the density a areas were your higher density areas under the outline development plans so they were little pockets here and there and a lot of the these living g zones so what we have proposed us to you know provide for some higher density specifically within the standards i I don 't accept this is very complex and it is quite complex and we actually as council officers we 're not even certain whether we 've got a hundred percent correct but during this time frame and this process we 've done our best to try and integrate the living g 'zone provisions and through the mediation process and hopefully as stage one as progress and decisions are out on the residential neighborhood provisions we can work with the large block developers and you know refine any roles that are needed so that we don 't you area but it would simplify the plan significantly what this is really doing is rationalizing what we 're a number of more bespoke zones and to 11 overall zone so there will be welcomed generally yes yes as I see it it certainly simplifies the plan we expect there will be particularly submissions from the large block developers we have included all the outline development plans so I you know we 're in terms of the broad direction that 's still required to be achieved in terms of the development of these areas it really just comes down to detailed rules right and whether they will work for them and week because we haven 't had a bility to consult we will have to do that through the submission process yep all right yep so just really interested in what this means for things like cycleways I know before we had debates in the past about OD peas and how they 're pretty tasteless and people just get consents and variations and basically you don 't get the kind of things that you would have speed so I 'm just kind of you bulk zoning that we miss out on those things that are really important like the upgrading to the intersections in terms of allowing for that development to occur so you just help me understand kind of what happens to all those other rules that were that that apply to the timing in the sequencing of development all in now between now and when this is presented to you again on Wednesday or your by the end of the week we we have refined to the area specific role attitude of those under section upgrades for example Preston 's had a number of them well one of those two of those are actually just about to be once completed in and one is near completed so some of them are actually have already been developed already been you know put in place so a number of the rules that we 're living g rules are obsolete now so we don 't need to carry those through we will continue to carry through those ones you know they hit a cycleway required before 200 lots you know there 's rules we will continue to retain so I 'm very confident that all the intent of them as they were decided through the various plane changes will still remain so those cycleways if they were a requirement they 'll continue to be a requirement but I don 't want to make it easier what is seen is that a number of developers apply for variations through a regionals consent process and I don 't want to make it any easier for them to get in this new planning framework to remove the requirements to provide the you know the landscaping and the other features that they 're supposed to do as part of the there are you absolutely sure that we 're not going to make it more permissive for them to avoid the kind of things that they should be doing no I mean as I see it the the area specific and Christians was one of the major ones where there was a lot of site-specific landscaping requirements with retaining those and the areas for some extended the other ones were mainly around intersection upgrades it was a neighborhood real rules are designed to have really good outcomes for these greenfield areas so I 'm confident that those provisions as they finally you know whatever they end up being along with all the assessment measures that you 're required to meet with the subdivision concede I mean they you know there 's still quite extensive that you will get these good outcomes I mean everything that you 're saying you know you 've spoken about as a dresser and assistant and a subdivision the system you know but they yeah I think you can 't you can 't stop them making a variation and free resource can see it we can 't stop but you know you can 't but you can have things in your district play easier or harder for them to get those concerns based on the assessment and so if you 're getting rid of a whole bunch of rules around timing or sequencing or whatever then I think you know like just the point that worries me is at the bottom of 107 whilst it is not known at this stage what the neighborhood science and that some of the figurines to Magister concerns of a large block developers like I just think that 's been far too optimistic that these developers are going to you know do what 's right these are the guys that can afford to hire the professionals to argue their case the community are the ones that have to deal with the consequences who don 't have the same resources I mean one of the most important things on the key structuring elements that are set out on the outline development plans they for the community those connections those you know roading connection cycleway connections recreational areas that all identified on outline development plans for a wider community or even a local community say to me and the most important and they will continue to be showing and development will have to occur in accordance with them so as far as that I think that 's addressed and will still be addressed okay Anika notice us one final question on the timing so there 's any timing of development changing their like if you take Preston 's the you 've got high step which I 'm not quite sure probably not much happening they 're probably in trouble so have you have you looked at these areas and thought actually actually the lens not really needed for housing because development is not happening or the geotech has come back all the infrastructure has come back and now actually we wouldn 't actually makes no sense to this is actually dealt with you know I have touched on this when I have discussed the future urban development areas at more to door staging if you can separate in your mind the act of rezoning from the staging of limb development because staging of lean development is determined one by the market to some degree and secondly by the council 's long-term plan because that 's when it puts in place for major infrastructure that will stage these developments what we deal with through the zoning of land is making sure that if lenders developed that the adverse effects of that say for example on the transport infrastructure that Susan upgrades are required before that lend you know well maybe kept until that 's put in place that is continuing through these areas for some extenze as I stated before the broader issue of staging of land development yes we always we constantly are considering that and reviewing weiland is available so and there 's a there 's a Ivan what yes be there is a wreck inflatable it is a costly report the land availability quarterly report comes out and lets it that some of the staging of land development yeah but I really do go into there 's a bit and then there is another recommendation that will come to that with the future of in development here is this one well it 's just it 's the one following so there 's residential then future urban development so there 's the recommendation on future urban development is rezoning the following areas from rural to draft future urban development zone so right yes yes famine and what were then then rezoning all greenfield priority areas too that 's right enable land use development that 's right that 's right talking about changing and streamlining these agencies sorry just plans there are there were 72 of them and they had various Preston 's and its transport one had five layers to the transport one some of those are decisions for they referred to intersection upgrades well they 've been completed so they 're no longer needed to be put in place the other thing y 'all juices also is you know mostly developed or large part of it development some of the outline development plans can be refined I mean we there has been a movement you know there are two approaches here one you can have very detailed outline development plans or alternatively you can leave it to the subdivision consent process to to you know sit out we 're density areas a whole lot of detail you can leave it over the last ten years I have seen both approaches taken and you know I personally think both work they both work and so but when you 've got these outline development plans and you don 't need to overly complicate the plan by having layers that are you can just pack up your key structuring elements repeat yourself those that are most important to the community are regulated you know some of these other things don 't understand we 're saying I guess my consumers through this process the community will not go into the same level of detail and not have the resources that they would have had as these were done through plan changes so it 's quite a different process to change this through the district clean as it would be on a case-by-case basis neighboring communities to you know go into quite high level detail about a low level detail about what the implications are so one neighbor might for example not want the road go past their front or might want to go around the back or whatever but it just seems to me that um I still yeah I just think that 's not proposed what oh that was suggested Thea is that through their mediation or submission process with the large block developers that we could look also we can 't do it here before notification all those are going to have to be notified but it 's just plans for the living Jesus because some of them you know obsolete now these are signs off on it but we didn 't there 's not actually there 's nothing you need to do the it was just um no but when the plans come back like they come back to the council horn or no I know it wouldn 't way that would be a curie through the mediation process so yeah but we wouldn 't be suiting the council officers are not going to seek to take away anything from an outline development plane we don 't_''_1410.27 I mean you could clarify that by you know its refining but not not removing any of the key structuring elements that I proposed through the OD piece I think it 's probably useful to get I mean others might not worry about this um I just removed the noble subdivision do so and I do kind of wonder whether it would be really good just have an example of to show the difference between in an existing ODP in a stream 11 and actually get a feel for what the 71 we can layer diagrams that this recommendation relates to so why don 't we just pick up the general concern and say that direct that they be simplified by removing obsolete requirements while retaining the key structuring elements essential to the comprehensive development of the site and management of adverse effects till we good right future urban development did you want to comment on that to our yelling before we go into that one I made a mirror if we could just bring your attention to the smaller piece of paper that was put out the changes to the table chapter I mean page three the Riccarton racecourse hang on door do you need those words that I just gave you as we do need a ride okay yes my say-so this is recommendation recommendation for 99 2 104 99 to 100 M for the residential streamline living g 'zone OD peas be simplified by removing obsolete elements obsolete elements and retain saleya requirements while retaining the key structuring elements doctor so all you 're doing is amending that that recommendation yes and take out the word that it peas yeah and it 's on page 109 cetera yes I say you agree with the recommendations they know on 107 I don 't well just move up and seconded by hey that the living g-o-d peas be simplified by removing obsolete requirements while retaining the key structuring elements that 's not on that it 's not up on the borders hey it 's not at the oh sorry sorry it 's in front of me so in its seconded by Phil Clearwater so so the recommendation might have known to 100 on page 109 that the staffs recommendation be amended recommendation be amended to direct the living g-o-d peas be simplified yeah by removing so you got something for pride yeah so if you put by and a little italics as well and then that 's the other words that you need to change yeah have a structuring elements then you see it in addressing any adverse effects yeah Oh anticipate I see so that I yeah but I 've got bold if you 're going to write the whole sentence on near then we got a direct that 're just going to yet yeah dot dot or do no no it 's not it 's direct that the 71 you know bit better we 're just here that it 's not we 're notifying without this change we 're giving them to get on with the job of working what the the people that are involved in these Oh DPS aren 't we too through the but we 're making it very clear that this is just removing obsolete requirements I 've fixed your problem because you were worried that they were going to change things that would take away something that the community would miss we 're only giving them the the go-ahead to get rid of the obsolete requirements it 's easy just removing redundant material from the we can only do this before council submission process them yeah we can we 've got a very limited time such that the community can see anything that 's change it may be that through consultation you know the large rock diversions want to keep them all in so okay people yeah that 's all so can I to actually take this whole approach from moving from a number of bespoke zones to one particular zone called the residential new neighborhood zone you agree with that approach well except that you you were going to highlight the fact that record and racecourse don 't want to be treated that way so it 's a secret have you already dealt with that no we haven 't dealt with that yet I just wanted to know that your was already has worsened I 'm surprised sorry was on buck he 's lost yes let 's nix that 's what we wanted to come to I just wanted to make sure enjoying this recommendation that whether that meant that you are agree agreeable with everything else in those two pages yep well I mean I 'm comfortable with that except that Riccarton racecourse wants to be treated secrets right so we can go on to that one and given that I can 't read this piece of paper because it 's so tiny I 'm not a hundred percent sure you know I mean if we agree to one thing surely to be okay our secret spatial areas yeah the loving g 'zone is one recommendation right that 's integrating the living g 'zone into the rezoning the living Jesus residential new neighborhoods right okay so it is the food 's livin g carrying through some area specific rules which they 'll be given to you by the end of the week to approve there 's a changed approach yes what we have tried to do is not penalize them in any way through integrating the living g 'zone and to the residue in your neighborhoods but the residential neighborhoods a slightly different approach because every single different living g 'zone had its own different set of rules and that 's what made it very complex but we don 't think through two test cases that they can still do their subdivision consents and build their houses in accordance with the outline development plan they 're not impeded in any way under the residential your neighborhood rules except for the density a area so we 're proposing some exemptions for them that they get a 200 square meter you know which at all the heights when we looked at all that you know did a comparison between the living g rules there is it to your neighborhoods in most cases there was very marginal differences so why go and have all these you know extensive complex rules when the resident of your neighborhood should still deliver the outcomes that they 're seeking that 's that cell how big was the smallest one I was like I only screw me today sorry 200 square meters no notice I had a head I think units that were 60 square meters or maybe even less remember that we remove that little straight with cars backed into the road that was the drive I 'm not familiar with the details they had really small little tiny units and people got really worried about that but so what 's the minimum size not you know out of the residential your neighborhoods they can do these variable it 's the latest name variable deep city areas where they they don 't have a minimum site size or unit they can just do multi-unit development or amex use a 20 metre square apartment here we 've got that new neighborhood rules in front of me but it 's designed and we 've clearly exempted ourselves from these requirements for our social housing so just just saying you know if you think of traffic like if you if you go from a development that you 've expecting two thousand people or units and you suddenly have 5,000 people it has a huge impact on here traffic so I guess that was my but we 're not reducing the size are we know personally the reason you 've been presented with the residential your neighborhood rules yeah you 've signed up you yeah you 've saying that they are appropriate for every other Greenfield area what we are saying is that also appropriate for the remainder of the development of the rest of the Living G zones and that they can they should yeah so I think that I think that that 's the answer is that we 've you know we 're getting into again discussions around things that we 've already decided so can I just put this but use the language by removing obsolete requirements yes all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor set I suppose I know that 's carried right now future urban development did you want to oh so so heavy past the recommendations then on pages on page 107 409 yeah but yeah they you know i 'm i 'm i 'm comfortable that but do you want to do riccarton now okay so perhaps we should make clear though then recommendations 99 to so recommendations 9292 104 are agreed with the exemption that with the age 109 whether worth yeah with the with the exception is yeah that the staff recommendation be amended to dress yeah okay so that _"

    "text": "alright so i 'm told that we 're up to residential chapter recommendation 90 and andrew has an usher in relation to the objective clause so what is the purpose of of the adding that sentence I guess the comment was um well as you with the strategic directions as they 're very focused on Christ Church flatlands nymphet and part of it even goes as far as stating provides for urban activities only within existing urban areas now that 's fine for christchurch city for beats peninsula though it 's not part of the greater christchurch area or a large part isn 't and some of these settlements that may be appropriate that some growth is provided for of some change over time not to say that these areas are expected to you know require major extensions to them or that that will be desired but some change may be appropriate and by not including some providing for some limited growth or some something in the strategic directions it would be limited if a development proposal came forward for say you know a change to some of the small an additional part to the objective proposed ian but as you say it 's outside the urban development strategy area yes but when you read objective strategic direction objective 337 as is a well-integrated pattern of development and infrastructure a consolidated urban form in a high-quality urban environment that provides for urban activities only within existing urban areas when existing urban area is that which would be currently zoned and we 're not at this stage opposing any extensions to the small settlement zones and beats peninsula so why are we writing that on there so that if a plan change comes forward and seeking to do a future zone that we still can provide for some limited growth around the settlements and basically but why can 't you do that without putting that on the objective because I mean it goes through in strategic directions objectives you might recall and especially now that there 's that process objective and the strategic directions we need to ensure that we have some capability through the strategic directions to be able to do this otherwise if there was a plan change that have to reject it outright even though it might have had some some good values associated with it I mean it may come down to if you didn 't include that it would come down to interpreting whether a development proposal is within an existing urban area well if it 's proposing to extend it you know that wouldn 't be clear it would be saying well it 's not within an existing urban area we 're proposing to extend an existing urban area so this is just providing that flexibility for some settlements to do change so tell me why you don 't want it on their injury yeah I mean I certainly don 't believe that this would be supported by most of the people who have chosen to live in the small settlement on banks peninsula there is a banks peninsula small settlement study that identifies identification in Aurora and then development in why new and there are some consented developments in winery or reading one of the things we heard through the consultation we did over the winery wastewater scheme is that one of the reasons didn 't want the wastewater scheme development to go ahead was because they felt that it would expand that settlement even though it 's identified in the small settlement study as an area that could be expanded if we 're looking at the genuine small settlement and banks peninsula and widening that net I certainly find it difficult to believe that the sort of permissive expansion or a more permissive expansion the way that you 've talked about would be supported by people who have chosen to live in those small settlements for good reason and Jamie talked earlier about people deciding to live in special immunity areas because of their their character and amenity and definitely the small settlements on the peninsula would be places that people choose to live or have chosen to remain to live because of their their immunity and their character so I certainly can 't support those those lines in in red been been added because I believe that they 're totally out of line with the expectations of the people that live on the peninsula who would definitely prefer the the status quo I mean the intention via was to you know provide for some limited so you know the word was limited I mean we could take it out it would be as I see it if the you know if there is sort to keep those settlements exactly as they are mean some of them may need to change over time they may be affected by sea level rise or they may want to may want some limited expansion I 'm not seducing in any way and don 't believe a market will even go to that extent of major changes but it would be very difficult to even even consider a very minor change I mean that that was really what my concern was with the the way that strategic direction is currently written but you know I can just will see a problem in the future if an application came forward so what would be my process for I mean it just not include it not include that but what would be the process then for say for example sea level rise meant that pure had to move further the draft a number of and this this may raise you know part of the inconsistency I and that was the draft that went through and was agreed there was a number of their own objective banks peninsula and also one that talked about each of the settlements and it said actually providing for some you know change and small incremental change around them so what I 'm now if we take this out I actually potentially may see an inconsistency between what we 're proposed for those that objective and three policies around consolidating any bloodshot development around existing settlements so I sort of see but I actually think of Pereira zubin you know I don 't_''_428.21 I don 't clean up these little places as urban so I don 't know whether we 're scientists measurements so they actually called settlements and the RPS and and the and the Utes in a urban development strategy they are called they don 't call do it I mean even you do tend to think of a city but they are residential activities if i seed I mean you could take the other of duties and policies and I suppose trust in the fact that this won 't be an obstacle in the future that it may be able to be interpreted in a different manner yeah I think it 's in the wrong place you know like the heating is urban growth form and design so it just doesn 't feel right to be talking about residential settlements and that in their area you know I mean I can I can understand you wanted them an objective but I wouldn 't put it in this one no I mean the difficulty I hate Thea was really with Point C provides the urban activities only was an existing urban areas that was that was the main and I didn 't want to see that as a barrier to I take your point that you know growth major growth will not not occur in Beck 's furniture it 's not desired but I didn 't want the settlements to be left with absolutely no flexibility to don 't got rules somewhere else for both settle months yes I years and the residential want to make what I was just raising is there is a potential syston see the air between what the message was given through the proposed objectives and policies for banks peninsula that I 've proposed through the draft and in here that was the only the point that I was just raising but and and it 's just a you know I take your point that it is this this really is about a major urban growth yeah that 's a quickly it doesn 't really set the scene for being punch like that so no it doesn 't and it just doesn 't feel like it should be there except that the regional policy statement may bay does have these settlements on it as well as the rest of the urban area for the city that 's why it 's there well I mean this this is a strategic direction for the whole of the district it 's not just the Christchurch City yes I know but but as urban growth form and design is that really what we want is the objective the objective is to allow but that 's not even growth form and design that I take your point but this is an overarching you know the way if you take away the heating its intent as a well-integrated pattern of development and infrastructure a consolidated even for all that 's the that 's the you know we 're the tomb consolidation and there is what we want to achieve the next furniture there isn 't overarching objective we want to keep any change consolidated around the settlements in a high quality of an environment will that is also what 's sort for being sponsor so I mean you could leave it as it as you can make no mention of banks furniture and just let the lower level policy objectives and policies no stand and have the most and supposed to trust that they will have due consideration but it is this higher level one which we ultimately have to ensure that our jeepers and policies through a residential chapter are giving a feat to that was I 'm all right well I 'd in line with what I said before I 'd like as is there anyone whose objecting to that because if no one 's objecting to it then I 'll will proceed to to vote on it all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "um the excitement I actually just before we do this coffee and tea that 's coming I just I propose that we just truck on with us if you want to grab a coffee please feel free to do so otherwise we 'll move on to sams if thats well which is just the next one over which from what I understand is also something pretty important to our community and council that represents them our community ventures because it 's pretty cute actually I don 't think how do i actually think they 'll be award which are this doesn 't a fear and what was the what 's actually being suggested we like this came to you what your job oh that can i just bring your attention to page 99 recommendation 93 92 93 and 94 yes the age 99 it 's where the office of recommendation as you see on the left-hand column to delete all category to character areas and delete all rules relating to category to category areas so this is the part this is what 's the impact of it the impact of the ones that 's you know findell Turner 's in there and I haven 't got the list right near me but there 's there 's all the category to which is there are a substantial number of areas they did not meet the basis season of having a high level of integrity in terms of character but at the request of council we included them back in and put and some rules that may give some positive lead to some positive outcomes but they 're more to do with amenity rather than character because the character in those areas you know has been has been lost an easel was there to parent what it was for example the penitence the one that I 'm theory from alex is quite a large area to go potentially but that was really about the level of open space it was provided with them sites because they 're very very large sites that is only about five or 10 square meters more though it was not from memory oh wow if you were got if you really wanted to protect what that character to be put in place was to have a minimum site size of 800 square meters now that would significantly impinge on the development potential of that area but what makes it unique or what makes the immunity high in that area is the big trees it 's the open space it 's a lack of development what we are saying though in terms of special character now we have got the since the draft the strategic directions have come out and they are making it very clear that we need to again remove this level of regulation in unnecessary prescriptive pneus and you know give rise to an unnecessary transaction costs as council officers firm position that the category two areas if we provide an additional level of regulation for them it will lead to additional transaction costs and unnecessary resource consent II because we in practice once someone applies for resource concede all that 's going to happen as the council officers going to assess it against effects assess it the fact that well there isn 't they continue or a cohesive character in the area and therefore of having to get a consent for something that really you know has gone so which though surely in turn though would then mean that perhaps someone looking at subdividing something would then go do you know what this isn 't the easiest or the most business for any place to do it so due to the barriers that i do see here will perhaps to go to an area that the council hasn 't classed as you know or category one or category two yes so and we 're certainly saying for catchers rework that those areas are special they are unique and therefore they do warrant a level of regulation we 're just saying for category2 to be consistent with the strategic directions particularly an objective three point three point two which is about clarity of language and efficiency that you know we cannot support the inclusion of category two now they will not be on the maps that you 've had produced because they 've been produced based on the okay my house officer recommendations what I do have sitting down here as a set of maps so was the Purim Street an upper area the area around the university was that at one or two one moment one moment please hurry is category to everything so that oh that whole area would not be included and normal the fingleton one neither would fendall to know and what were the other category 2 1 is this different than what 's on page 119 19 attention one um the areas we are you reading from 119 of the document Oh piffle place yeah that 's gonna return the paper when the gold is killing real character are you saying that you go take this i don 't i don 't wanna say today yes the council guys I 'm healing hi very one of the gold 10 and can 't agree to other people ones certain people ones will be proposed to be dated so that will go download about capacit are for spatial area your CVA is the spatial area and then totaled the category one its twenty eight thousand five two hundred and eighty-five thousand square meters and catagory to was a total of seven hundred here just to try and just truncate this about let 's assume that the mind of the people sitting in this room that era Leda members very similar to the last one understand what started what you know the pertaining advices around it let 's say the elected members spoke this was a better they want back in this important to the community what would you recommend that we do at this point is it may just be last time that there has to be perhaps someone else that presents that all right the difficulty you will find is that if you change it having any evidence leads that 's going to support the inclusion because we believe we 've taken a very pragmatic approach to assessing these areas the evidence sort of the facts or the assessment speaks for themselves now and to have someone would have to go out there and reassess and come to some different conclusion to support the retention based on deeming them to be special enough to justify regulation I think you will find very very difficult to find someone to support an alternative at times a leader members do make that call we looking at an outcome but you 're also balancing the political realities and that 's why they were lead to members and not robots and then order very high company director a lot of people who live in them who would think that and I guess just following on with what Vicki said that in for the last example in the commentary that went around that about a quality of life both now and for the future people have made a decision to peps being an area which was classed a particular way and then to remove their despite a radical change potentially on contradicting the reasons that they might have even moved into that that area yeah I understand that peps through a resource consent process it may subdivision may be able to go ahead anyway but I think from a certainly a political point of view I can Vicki 's actually write it will go down like a cup of cold suck and out there 's no why I 'm actually coming from everything that I 've learned actually put my name to that so that 's just something that I 'm personally not not comfortable with to take away the the character area to that we designated there I totally appreciate all the advice that you 've got I just don 't comment though you don 't have you can still use other methods you can still use design guides you can still identify an area it 's just that we 're not going to we 're not saying it should be rigged all of these areas should be regulated under the district plan you can still know the design guides have been quite successful and and used through subdivision consents you can still use those but you know it really comes down to what is the most appropriate method and it 's not to say even if the community stat you know if I even taking the approach of only note regulating the category one it may be that the community does submit highly on this matter and then through that process but at the moment we actually don 't have a good indication about how know we have anecdotal and you know it 's sort of advice I think we 've got actually we 've we 've got really good clear public indication about what they feel and thats Sarah share an idea and also the central study special immunity areas we are over I don 't know the exact figure but I 'm thinking it was about 99% maybe 95 seen hundreds of submissions and support of retaining special immunity areas from our community now we know the government ignored that but there was huge public support for special immunity areas being retained and being strengthened and not being weakened and removed so I think this is basically just like the last one like I just think we quote that we want to ensure the Crushers just place where people wish to love and we actually want to see a high quality recovery and rebuild and that these character is actually contribute to that because i actually think people do like living and neighborhoods that have identity in uniqueness and special characteristics so i just think we just we 've done the work staff should just vote on retaining them and i think stuff we 're done the work to justify it but we might need independent I 've got I 've got a lobster Jimmy mine is a question around Emmett Street and the recommendation to remove that that seems to be based on the housing New Zealand development for the area that could be problematic if the Sam remained or if the character area remained is that right there 's a pretty sexy summary okay that 's cool i 'm not trying to score points or just trying to get it straight up ahead so is there anything 22 could we put something in place that would require the developments by housing New Zealand to take into consideration the special heritage elements of the properties in the area the trees and so forth so that they can still develop and do what they want to do but not at the expense of an area that is acknowledged by staff in fact when they say regrettably you 're suggesting it goes we don 't lose an area as a result what you 're what Sarah 's been saying all along is that yes we think Sam 's are a good idea however we don 't have sufficient evidential evidence to say that we can support the category two of which Emmett Street is one no Emmett streets a category where garbage Emmett Street the thing with him and yes we have suggested and then fetch the wording was we would hope that through their development and I don 't know the mechanism that 's appropriate you know to try and build that into with housing New Zealand but that they do look at the area and do design it sympathetic to the area certainly retain those mature trees and the same but their betters us you know that is has to be something separate from the district plan because that though as we were talking about before words regards to the home star you know you can hope and you know rely on or hope that people will do the right thing or that they what we need is something that will actually give us a bit more surety I mean that 's in a in a CO one area and surely it all really been slammed because of the quakes and the infrastructure damage to remove the area as a character or a special area because someone wants to do some major development I can 't rationalize that yep not council officers we found this one very very difficult and we to to fruit but in terms of what our recommendation would be we looked also a bit wider and saying I think it was the ear Utley were other areas and that provided we retained those I think a list of the name of the other character and with you know with in Christchurch that would sort of keep that social and architectural history elsewhere in the in the city this was a particular site that we knew we know that they want to they suppose the development plans that they 've looked at wouldn 't be able to incorporate the existing buildings so they would be you know going essentially clearing the site and redeveloping and maximizing the develop potential just we 're the site we each site we each quite big sites they set far back from the road I mean that 's what makes it unique susan lee this this is essentially what we considered as the fact that no they would lose that character area there would be no way to retain those buildings and to comprehensively develop that site and because they own you know all of these sites it was weighing up is that more important than retaining the character is achieving some of these other outcomes that sort through the strategic directions more important than retaining special character and because it was a lot you know multiple properties owned by one housing provider they were social housing provider in this case it was at difficult situation where council officers are saying well given the strategic directions those outcomes you know override the character so that that is simply too what we could look at is you know our last sort of comment there about making sure that it 's comprehensive and empathetic years well we could look at some assessment meters for the site we could look at some again design guides for the _''_1044.15 'm not aware of any disc discussions Josie Schroeder is not here she may be more party to some of the one-on-one discussions with powers in New Zealand but we can look at doing that but we 'd have to bring that back to you character in this some part of surely there are regular discussions with housing New Zealand done through another part of the strategy and planning group through Carolyn Engles group and we can relay these thoughts through those meetings most definitely but that isn 't regulatory then then it won 't it still won 't be regulatory in the district plan ok can I appeal to my colleagues here because actually I I don 't know whether you would support it anyway but I see this as a thin edge of the wedge and if this can be done in this in auburn 's and surely this can be done anywhere else and I don 't think that it 's a good enough argument to say that will retain the type of history and character of this surely area in other parts of the city these these neighborhoods mean something very special to the people who live there obviously they can 't_''_1123.89 be quantified those emotions cannot be qualified a quantified and neat provable points that 's just the nature of the human condition so I have very little respect for rules that just as so neat that humans can 't fit into so I 'm totally and fine with since I think that if people want them great that 's actually what the plan is there so what do you what do you got Paul for another question after you but so what are you specifically asking in terms of negotiating the best outcome for some development here but if we take all this out and just jump all now we 've got nothing I mean I 'm happy that there is intensification as well as some of the years as long as it 's done well what 's the move and design which one concert could retain the character area and through mediation or through council submission between now and then have some discussions with housing New Zealand and try and come up with yearning in this lean and then we 'll make a decision my dot I mean I drive around and crushed just quite a lot and and I had to say that largely the horse is bolded he drive down most streets there 's a modern house in an older developed area and I I just someone just wonder through progress things do change eventually and you might even find new characteristics developed so a question probably is it has the horse bolted kick and and can we stop it from actually Bolton further yes for category to it has bolted that 's exactly what we are saying for category one know there is an eighty percent level of you know them what we call primary sites where they do demonstrate the characteristics that we have listed or identified in the policy which make an area special there 's exactly what we are saying not and you will know when you drive down these category one streets and you look at them and you read the policy and then you look at the street you will see that they are different other ones we need to focus on and put our most attention and to trying to continue to retain the second part of the question is is it by by going to the distance of a she pushing to keep Kelly to do could that actually interfere with trying to retain the category one to the level we want to retain it by being so staunch on expanding and if you 're not event I hope that the evidence that we put forward and as will demonstrate that category 1 we will be certainly differentiating between category 1 and category 2 so that we hope that it does not happen but that is a risk that would certainly be a risk cool and I 've got Yanni and then blend this is part of the land use recovery plan housing New Zealand was supposed to do area-wide master plans for intensive housing areas the best of my knowledge not a single one has been done we were supposed to have a look meeting this week I think it 's just being postponed so you know I think we do need back to the point that these areas have an intrinsic value if you talk to our heritage people tourism people on the reasons people came to Christ Church was because of our heritage and our character so you know I think I think we 've already changed the special immunity areas in this category to section from a bit of a tighter restrictive rules to more kind of assessment around the streetscape so I think personally I think we just need to stand firm on this and we probably do need to start actually asking housing New Zealand where their master plans off all these intensive development areas I mean I just know originally what they proposed to do in like Richmond was totally out of character with that local neighborhood it was just really you know far too excessive in terms of the density and the expect so yeah I just think we should just vote on this and move on but I 'd support retaining what we 've got and how we will assist lean may throw us all off with a curveball but no no fully support Zealand change and other Nui with proposals there so I 'm sure both with this edit local level the outcomes that we really want can be achieved or I think guys I should stop beating around the bush and I like this as much as Jonnie go head-to-head sometimes once in a blue moon we do we do agree and I would be actually delighted to move this and yanni would you would you see him eat with us I 'll tell you what what it 's for just to simply like last time simply changed delete to retain so retain category two carat areas and the one that also says delete all rules or draft provisions just changed changedelete to retain is that is that fine Brigitte where is this i mean they told me there are quite a few categories so urban avenue riccarton you 're keeping it the same so there 's still no change so it 's only regarding here that straight I think well that would do it was it because it will stay stay no change what Emmitt Emmett Street was a different recommendation say retain yeah and whoever says no change that remains as know exactly no so anything that says delete we change to retain that 's right that really covers it nope just to confirm urban street we didn 't recommend of being removed anyway that 's right no it 's a bit no change change obviously remains no change that 's evidence so if we have a really clear record so that we can have a process I 'm not sure why you 're doing that so that we don 't lose track of a so because I know that those are we really rushed but I don 't get we go with letting drag over okay for sure expert witnesses will be called in as they need it so that is what we want as counselors we want some oversight over the evidence that we 're providing on these sensitive ones because we don 't want to put you in a bad position of trying to defend the things that you 've previously comedy evidences left to whoever is giving evidence that is there evidence it 's not written some other side of what evidence we think has it as needed I think we 're running the risk of over complicating this more than we need to also just that I don 't that we need regarding Emmett Street surely okay do you mind if we just put this toolbar it 's just recommendation 30 93 94 on page baba just change the word delete to retain regarding am category two character areas that covers everything yeah and I don 't you need the industry surely do emmitt street is a category one so just just yep and end retain Emmett Street yeah and retain is straight and retaining street as a category one character area so and I are the only the only thing I would say to this is I I think that well the planning advice has been completely correct I think that it 's looking backwards and I see the kettering to zhe looking forwards because every time I go into a community board meeting in these areas people have actually moved into these spaces because of the Sam they don 't want this taken know I understand the planning advice I appreciate it but I don 't feel comfortable in the past if someone 's been swayed by that but i bet my gut and I and there 's no way I 'm deviating from this rightly or wrongly I want this retained I believe that everyone else here feels the same way this is a battle i 'm prepared to take on and i 'm delighted to move it yani is lighter to seeking that and he may I may I ask those in favor please say aye I a post I 'm Justine carried unanimously thank you guys _"

give the grunting runs out of the way I 'm in your hands so whatever you saw the gradual odds over the way okay so home starters I don 't_''_35.46 directed by the people here what page is that record I just have to find it so it 's of the and spiral-bound document page 117 from 17 and a spiral-bound statement of expectations reduce regulation recommendation actually it sucks the sixth star and then when they come back there was obviously some controversy about a bit the fans panel but obviously it stayed in here okay so when we put forward the draft to you for your consideration at that stage we were aware that evidence was being lead through through the Hearing Panel on stage one and at that stage it was just the decision that we put forwarding you supported that that we retained for the remaining remaining zones that were being proposed through stage two since that position council officers have been aware of the evidence lead and they changed position of council staff through the stage one and there is through evidence that has been given and the light of that council staff consider it would be inconsistent to continue to oppose the life star and energy-efficient standards under the stage two so in chapters because it would just be in a way re litigating something that 's being addressed and pretty close to being resolved through the stage one hearings there is no decision released yet the hearing is still ongoing so until there is a decision released we don 't know what the resolution will be 0 why would we change our position what well it 's a staffed change so it 's council officers changed position and also I believing lead through legal submissions as well in terms of those two standards and it 's also based on the evidence that 's been given the main reason rationale for it is that it 's more appropriate to use other suppose as a first measure to improving so awesome use the district plan pop very leading if your reticle why can 't we I am not actually fully up to date where the number that 's actually being a borough your tomorrow is a friday okay well yes I mean the evidence it 's being lead through this council through its council officers and other advisors are there other methods are I could you tell them that I 've ever look at that well such as an advisory and supporting information all through the building code I do I am aware that the ministry from building and industries are looking at changing the building act or introducing you know suppose it 's similar to building design codes or looking at changes to the code so that it 's been considered outside of a suppose of resource management eat oh but that 's not we have got infantry know what NB does they currently got a two-star a sedative building and and yet these data strategic direction talks about a high-quality rebuild question it I mean the option is a stall is that we will end up being leading the same evidence the same taking the same position for this stage two chapters but you you know there is the option of store including them and still notifying but just recognize at this stage I suppose my position was us to try and remain as consistent with stage one and I suppose you know leaked that to be the guiding what 's guiding us and stage two I can 't see the point personally and ask them involved in all this unless we can achieve some high quality outcomes and one of the highest quality outcomes are one of the most desirable outcomes would be that we actually build energy efficient homes in the rebuild of Christchurch so personally if we 're not going to do that I 'm just happy to hand over I mean this is like run through how you might have a district plan and exits of an area mate really I mean this is what they 're practicing like to speak and but if we 're not going to actually have decent homes bold which is whole shooting box to the government and just say you go through just as part of the urban development strategy ID number 6.1 1.1 and housing the action is to publish sustainable energy efficient housing design guidelines specific for Canterbury and incorporate there is an implanted provisions and building controls and the key progress from there is actually build maxmara initiative and it was supposed to be addressed through the district and replacement district plan so I 'm quite confused the fact that is part of the urban development strategy it says this and then on the other hand we 're getting kickback fresh you doing what the UDS is actually directing us to do it seems quite bizarre but it 's this is an earring fennel this is this the urban development strategy as the greater Christchurch coming together government is actually involved in that process will they get up form in that process I 've agreed to the development strategy development strategies build back a more sustainable warmer drier homes which home star rating actually is so we 're getting told and guided by this particular plan but plan comment on me when an action has put forward in a non century document it still has to be carried through and considered under whatever statutory document that 's you know that it 's been indicated as being dealt with so what 's happening here is whilst that principle still remains and council officers are still in full support that they 're achieved as how it 's achieved so the issue that we begin to look at is what is the best most effective method the district plans about what we have been required to look at as whether the level of regulation that 's required whether it 's most appropriate to deal with it to get you know to get the desired outcome through the district plan it may be in is my understanding now I am not part of the evidence for stage 1 I will state that so I 'm only making this comment based on my understanding of where that is and it would be more appropriate that those who have provided that to come and speak to you but what I can say is because there are other methods to maybe a chit to achieve those outcomes that they 've been considered as more appropriate at this stage or the level of regulation difficult your hands so the other methods can be and through the building code through design yet changed no that 's right so yeah we don 't have anything what so end times oh no this that 's right i mean at this stage all the decision is to rely on maybe future changes or that may or may not happen equally the council we do have no design guides or we do have advisory so you can still promote you can still advocate and promote very strongly and hope that the market will begin to pick this up there has been in that is the always with design guides the issue is the fact that they don 't get taken up by the market quickly and they just look that is the risk so just push back from the ministers on this what do you think the chances are of the change in the building code given one of the think we can answer be a week we can actually I 'd say though all right all right we 've got Glenn been yawning you just want to Becca this some for me if it is as it reads and black and white I find it quite disturbing so page 12 of the minister 's comments about the council apparently changing its mind over life mark and gloom start with what Vicki 's said to me if we didn 't kind of make that explicit in our plan we sort of have an unconference unto ourselves given the fact we built housing and our social housing we have a partnership look like Mark over that I also feel that while there may be other approaches that could possibly be relied on to me in some ways I actually see this plan I mean this is us it 's our voice so maybe you can talk about those other approaches but this is our plan and I know it 's is a takeover by this panel but I still think we need to make explicit in this plan this brush now and that we are barrier free and yet we are refusing to say that we want to build houses so for these same people who really use the city can actually use it we 're opening eight units built to life mark standards this Friday we 've been having sod tunings for numerous other you know so I 'm not sure how we can have a plan that actually doesn 't promote that on the one hand in social housing our own housing on the other which does do that it 's just it is yeah also pretty similar things here but by yanni I think um so staff have got you know their professional advice which is fine you have to realize that they operating under the statement of expectation as being the strategic direction of this district plant so we 're in it we 're in a new dynamic we 're not doing an assessment against the RMA anymore like we used to we 've got a strategic direction air planet says we have to remove or so minimize as many controls on development as possible we have 's really obvious so you know i don 't think i don 't know it 's really for us to start having a big debate with staff over like the merits of that because that 's or even agreed by the independent hearings colonel so i think what we should be better focus our time on is why under that statement of expectation not minimizing these things make sense and I 'm Paul 's gonna have some really good evidence I think we need to start getting more legal advice supporting up position and and probably some technical evidence as we talked about when we were preparing this chapter y lifestar my horn sorry life mark in Home Star if she makes sense from a resource management point of view I think it 's the only way we 're going to win this I so let 's focus on getting that information supporting our case well no yeah what we heard before as we get independent advice to support a position because it 's hard for staff to go and argue on a pure technical point of view given the there 's no reason why we can 't I mean I suggest Vicki goes to the hearing in front sup I 'm happy to go um we all kind of feel the same obviously that this little pointer and feedback little points coming from a little pointers are having that discussion and things if it 's not to make any difference what is it at the moment that is causing the position of the most or creating the minister 's position on rejecting will not be supportive of this the position that we 're taking I 'm just seeing if we can look at that and intelligently support like it 's probably possible okay right right okay so based on their to Brigitte that 's what I want to ask you because I know that obviously you have to do things reasonably prescriptive Lee within the systems and processes you 've got earlier we talked about how the the policy the land policy statement around the quarrying for example wasn 't it wasn 't multiple the situation was different when there was adopted and so forth could one not apply building and new houses and rebook going on in Christchurch now that it had never been envisaged a hets that there was this degree when perhaps the building code for example if you want to use that as a measure of the minister 's using that as a measure because it 's totally contrary to the points that vicki has just laid out with regards to making the set all the points that are Vicki 's may do about it being a great place to learn House of the People and 11 can we not use illogical yeah and stage one and support of these rules and still there has been a movement towards having the regulations removed and moving towards as a set here on on page 12 of the minister 's comments where councils experts are changing position more towards other methods or other assessment matters so what has been proposed here is to be in parallel with what 's being discussed under stage one in relation to the same rules but you have every right to reconsider the matter when it comes to stage two because it though is that it 's highly likely that the questioning and the evidence potentially and the mediations will go the same way as the head of the stage ranged our position I mean how this is something we 've said from day one I don 't know is the difference between council changing position and this is this is really just coming through evidence being lead through stage one so there 's quite a big difference there between what you notify and what you agree to to get to that point compared to what has been led by officers in expert witnesses so when they 're producing evidence that and going through mediation that is where positions changed and fetters just part of the process but this still has to be consideration of the statement of expectations and has been as it has been explained to you this hearings panel is placing quite an emphasis on the statement of expectation so there has been evidence also alternative evidence that 's been given by other witnesses to say that this in court that this is incongruous with the statement of expectations additional layers of housing provisions through the draft residential proposal will add unnecessary constraints to achieving the Crown 's housing objectives and goals despite the direction provided by the decision on strategic directions proposal the draft proposals remain confusing and overly prescriptive which is why savings through you know oh this is your decision is to decide whether or not you accept officers reckon emotional you want to change it so anyway guys in a bid to consider bullets and stop wasting time we 're all saying the same things the question is do you or do you not want to pick this metal here it appears that this majority of people saying yes you do want to pick this battle which in turn means that we just go back to what we had originally said so let 's just do that now and put it to a vote why are you trying to change this alley because we 're actually agreeing with you so I just don 't want to waste any more time what we do is we may need to change the planet giving evidence and we or different planners before their visit mrs. Bennett this has been a consistent position we are talking about like those core elements in the and his statement of expectations two of them save minimize read red tape and one of them talks about a high-quality recovery and rebuilding project they 're actually completely contradictory and where we 're going for the high quality one and he 's saying don 't do anything yep Egypt Direction 's is the first thing that the independent government appointed hearings phenol dead so they now set the framework for staff who were brought them the really difficult position of having to argue and actually give evidence based on a strategic direction which wasn 't something we 'd signed up to as a council it 's something the hearings panel signed up to I think I think we are ok so effectively you need from us then to just to put to a vote that we revert to what we originally had yes we need to pass a motion and that recommendation 108 on page 117 on page 117 of the table change the risk delete Jackie yeah so we place a new place to reach extra time yeah retain the following built in a minute maybe that the key should give some reasons like she did just before it should be record do you want full we thought we 've taken down all of your reasons as you 've been speaking here take that okay yeah so everything I just need to see that that 's correct before you don 't wanna yeah yeah writing it up do we can just have retained the following built form standards with with a heading of residential please right you 've got querying there yeah well that 's right so you 've gotten six point two point three one I don 't need those are those numbers 6.26 6.3 it 's going to get quite confusing I would just say recommendation 108 on page 117 change the word delete to retain that 's right all right would you tell you what Oh Vicki 's Vicki 's moved it you can see conduct clean all those in favor say aye aye opposed carried okay _"

    "text": "straightforward recommendation 53 this is all cemeteries and various other things recommendation 54 recommendation 55 thanks forward the honor down we 're on to public I a recommendation gosh we 've gone back to recommendation one little bit here bun hey ya know but how come we 've gone from recommendation 55 to recommendation 10 it 's on page 25 we 're just following the recommendations numbers that the minister has used oh I see fortunately sometimes they go back to one okay all right I know I know I thought I was really cooking on gas there the puppy playing zone so recommendation one recommendation to yeah I was just really struggling to understand this topic I Inga so basically they want us to be more permissive and enabling is it as it kind of weather getting too so we just basically say this is papa ke anger it 's up to Maori to basically develop as they seek first it 's the chapter as it was written had a number of restrictive standards and Christians and they 're essentially what the chapter was designed as we talked that very enabling zone essentially we would just deal with any of external adverse effects and if you say counselor it 's really up for the owners of the public anger area to determine how to develop the area in accordance with their culture there are some standards and provisions will still apply for example natural hazards landscape coastal and those matters still apply but in terms of how they wish to develop the area with us for some housing for education cooking sentence or whatever their nets up for them to determine and to deal with within that area of land or we 're dealing with us in external adverse effects excellent is there any controls of things like height yes the height is controlled by those standards which relate to recession planes in maximum height well I think that 's amazing that you 're able to do such a you know extraordinary amount of reworking and I think it will be responded to extremely positive Lisa recommendation 3 recommendation for reward recommendation there 's lots of recommendation for 2 30 ml rules and procedures recommendation 5 what changes you what you 've done so the minister 's comments was around the stage two chapters seeking to make any modifications and stateline definitions so it 's part of the review for example for height the stage 2 chapter was recommending adding another exemption for Heights for spires on find spiritual facilities the advice impetus is to try to avoid and the minister 's comment has been to avoid making any changes to the stage when definitions to reduce the complexity of the process for participants so what I 'm recommending here is rather than changing the stage one definition to add that exemption adding these emption into the rules themselves so the effect is basically the same it 's rather than saying that spires and spirit facilities are exempt from the definition of heights were saying in the scheduled activities rules they 're permitted to go up to nine meters or twelve meters for spires so I 'm not changing it yeah um there 's many under the recommendation three we 've got general rules and procedures you 've said additional strategic direction of digital memory subjective services are not so basically have you you 've put an objective than strategic directions on each different chapter now full of random additional minister is that we consider as a result of the decision on the strategic directions chapter whether or not we needed to introduce additional discipline policies to cover our stage to chapter right so well that 's removed policies around certain things just to ensure that the provisions that we 're proposing are still consistent with the decision on the strategic direction chapter and this is to say that it that they are we 're not proposing any additional objectives can I suggest something that would be really useful to put and here would be that we 've also done an assessment under the RMA so because if you take the coring for example what it it becomes really clear that there 's a competing contradiction often a contradictory approach between the RMA and the minister 's statement of expectation and so I think it 's our job to kind of you know take into account the minister 's comments but also we have to have consideration of the I just think would be useful to have something in here that made reference to the fair particularly where we 've disagreed with the minister 's comments or not made changes the reason for doing that is based on an RMA assessment about sustainable management and the principles of the are sorry I can 't see where this fits into the general rules and procedures what you 're talking about council is already in his section 32 which is why she 's giving this recommendation what you 're saying is that we 've put on these things on a chapter but I on a topic by topic places which is fine no no instead of saying that a spiritual facility is received from the maximum building height it says the maximum building height is this for everything but this for aspire on I 'm sorry you went really quickly I was on recommendation 3 which is sorry what does recommendations Freeman Oh God sorry you actually haven 't_''_417.31 moved to recommendation for no 22 comments from the minister 's here one was around making sure that we don 't need proposal for general rules stage 2 and the other was to consider whether the objectives and policies in the proposal are giving effect to strategic directions so the recognition that I 've made is that we don 't need to add any strategic directions objectives or policies but that each of the subtopics was considered in its objectives and policies whether or not it 's consistent with the new decision on the strategic directions chapter yeah the latest but about what we also need to do like if you take quarrying is we need to lay out the sustainable management under the RMA of our natural resource and our environmental impacts so I 'm just worried that we kind of assume that the only kind of direction of other strategic direction for our general rules and procedures is based on the statement of expectation and the new strategic direction rather than the actual RMA which is also equally as important there 's an assessment against the RMA as well integrations but I mean we 're going to we 'll deal with it when we deal with the individual ones that that that we 're going to come back to a strategic discussion around the buffers for for quarrying I mean that the meter and things like there then of course the resource management responsibilities are part of it but I don 't see that that 's relevant to our discussion around general rules and procedures so can we move on to recommendation for recommendation five yep on the first part of recommendation for the overlay for little time creating an area for the markets I noticed that you 're not running any or you 've got na impact in there the complexity for participants the only participants involved would of course be the people that run that littleton market in that stage one definition when we take that out of the context of stage two the reason why that was in stage one was in response to community feedback to littleton master plan in particular I noticed now that the stage one definition has become involved in the stage two decision and that 's already been done what concerns me is that that potentially delays resolution of this matter where supported by the community and littleton masterplan outcome which continues to be a non-complying activity and by merging stage one with stage two we then don 't deal with this as an issue of its own which in fact it is but in the wider context of temporary activities done that actually wasn 't question I 'm sorry the yeah I mean I guess just some explanation of where we 've landed on that and what the likely outcomes are going to be now because I mean the the minister 's comment is around reducing complexity looking at the background to why stage 1 and stage 2 have been dealt with separately in beginning there is no complexity because the only person or the only body there would be complexity for other people running the little to market and they 're desirous to get this result as quickly as possible um with your leave if I could just call Mark Stevenson he 's just gone back to his desk he 's probably the best one to speak to that because of the commercial nature of this particular definition okay sure so it was recommendation for till it 's the only issue on recommendation for that we will come back to that when yeah okay recommendation five recommendations sex what are setbacks this was raised at the start I just want to kind of someone to explain are we making it easier for people to do stuff and water setbacks are we making it harder what are the choices that G is based on online platform rather than PDF no that is a number of stuff around water setbacks this is this library come over this is heading but online Mets of water body classifications under the theme you know I 've got to do a sip x yeah there 's a whole bunch of roles and fought and 4576 work for what I setbacks know Gotye right gombe can 't afford it 's the time it 's it 's all of them I asked for a general information as to what we 're changing our own water setbacks and what effectively it means so um so it seemed to be where is it we 're going back to jump ahead water bodies setbacks yes but as you were rightfully saying that 's about just simply how they occur on the maps the actual issues of water bodies some page 26 exactly what it really asking for clarification about the effect of the rules overall or about yeah so it 's not changes its intolerance I 'm a very fixed for water bodies like Justin generals I 'm just trying to understand it a high level kind of what their proposed amendments that we 're looking at leaders in terms of our water bodies so there 's am there 's several changes that are proposed in the chapter and generally if the effect will be to make it more difficult time to develop in water body set max so one of the changes is around removing some of the exemptions studies just at the moment so one exemption says if they already have a building consent they don 't need the resource consent but the resource consent process successes different matters from the building consent I so for building foundations potentially it would become more difficult to develop in the setback of ecological significance and introducing some new controls around fencing and impervious surfacing in order because they have effects on the flood storage capacity and land drainage so trying to assess are trying to address some of those effects so I think the general effect of the rule is is to make it more difficult to build in the setbacks which is around again removing written approval notification requirements right in this case in the operative plan there 's no controls on fences are impervious surfacing in the setbacks so we 're proposing for the first time that consents would be required for those types of developments and setbacks and one of the reasons for potentially removing the requirement for notification is because it is a new rule which would significantly potentially increase costs for applicants I 'm for fences and some of those types of Dell developments so that was why I was recommending in this case in order to simplify that process for applicants to to not require notification and yeah okay so i 'm just so like a camp for example might be interested in what people be notified for something like a fence that was built over a waterway if this recommendation was adopted there wouldn 't be notification for that for the fence I 'm just trying to understand the test of leaving a turn so if something really bad is proposed and the neighbors or someone that uses the waterway it gets really concerned they would be notified if we make the changes that you 're recommending people basically wouldn 't have any chance to know that it happened and effect effectively there 's no control wait I thought you said there weren 't any controls now there aren 't in the operative plan so the fencing controls are proposed for the first time this is a new new control when one of the reasons for the control is because of the effects that it could have on transferring natural hazards to other sites with the amenity effects on other sites which was writing the original draft proposal I hadn 't removed the requirement for notification because it might transfer the risk to someone yeah what else which i think is a sensible thing on then i think they should be notified and weep or am i doing with a number of cases in the hills still want to run off and boundary fences so personally I can 't see any justification for removing it other than I know that the Minister wants us to remove notification but I think the risks here too great and it 's difficult to it difficult to kind of make a final call on there can we can we get some more information on that one I just I don 't think that there are many areas where we we need to depart from this but but because i don 't really know that implications of bringing in a requirement for the first time and then and adding on this notification requirement and how would you know i mean i but but if you have to if you have to get a consent for breaching the impervious surfacing and fencing standards which are introduced for the first time what what who judges whether the impactors as such that you wouldn 't grant the consent well the the standard so if somebody wanted to develop more than that they would need to come in for a consent and when they come in for the consent application normally the planner processing that consent would make a decision about whether or not it should be notified right unless there 's a rule in the plan saying that it won 't be notified so the effect of adding this would be to make that decision in advance to say this is a minor development and we don 't want to add that additional costs as part of the application i 'm going to skip that stage where you can kind of get there for imperious surfacing and and trust that the consequences are not a flow-on effect deliberate use of words to another poverty what about the imperior are the fencing standards though I mean I mean does that ever become an issue and a peak people can 't just put fences along our rivers can that thing is I know but I mean what is 11 some controls in the bylaws are on fences that are obstructing waterways but there aren 's very it 's very reactive process so generally people put up their fence and then there 's there 's some rules in the bylaws that allow counsel to come along and request that they remove them because they 're obstructing the waterways but generally that needs to be quite a serious issue before that processes undertaken so why are we writing on this requirement when the appointment remove notification know why are we writing on a requirement for impervious surfacing and fencing standards if we haven 't had them before well based on the advice of the asset and network planning units and there 's been a number of issues around fencing being built directly along the edge of the waterway and it has quite negative amenity effects it transfers floodwaters from one property to another property sort of a number of issues that have been raised as a result of it so the council would enforce that yeah through the consent process and a neighbor wouldn 't necessarily know that that was an issue that was going to have an impact on their property if the notification requirements notification were there if I lived alongside of rubber and someone down the road was going to build a fence I wouldn 't necessarily know I probably would sign a consent because there are my mate down the road not knowing that they were transferring the flood for us to me you know like so actually it probably is better to be a council process if we had the notification requirements in there would make it a call about whether the effects were more than minor and if they were more than minor then they would maybe say it should be limited to being notified on the two people in a Jason which I there 's anything seems reasonable so there 's not saying everyone will be notified it just gets the staff an opportunity to say actually the these impacts are going to be quite sick you know more than minor and therefore we think the neighbors for the wider community should be notified yeah but thing is that maybe they maybe they don 't make maybe the truth is is that is that you don 't want fences another property you can 't rely on a on a notification process you 've actually got to write rely on a robust council consenting process well that may be the case but people generally feel pretty agreed when things happen next to them and they have no chance they 'd they 're not notified of it so when they first have a google fence that 's three feet tall three metres tall they are likely to get quite upset that no one thought that they should be notified and then we go through anything we can then do is go oh well we have to go for a judicial review and then you know that 's going to cost fifty thousand but this has got nothing to do with purple fences that are three meters tall what 's to do with convincing standard and impervious you think servicing provision that has never been in our rules before so I 'm just asking is that a step too far to require it to be notified yeah well we just have a different point of view I personally can 't see the better to do that no because some I just kind of feel like I 've really have to drive on as fast as I can the process of sort of kind of setting things to one side if they want to take time hasn 't really worked as well as I thought it might so so we 're we got the little tongue yes right if I just provide three context phase one stage one the commercial chapter had rules and a specific version which permits the market and in the street and stays to the land the market sits on the road is being zoned as a transport zone so effectively the rule in the commercial chapter wouldn 't be relevant because it 's essentially becoming a transport own through the whole review process so what that means for the temper activity rules is what it means is the tip reactivity rules apply to the transport zone and stage two and my understanding of the temporary activity rules is that the rules permit the market and the transport zone if it 's authorized by councillors Road controlling Authority so for managing it any any temper activity in the roads are in the transports owners to be managed by councils other arm being the road controlling Authority thank you so that 's the effect of moving it into the states to rather than stage one so it actually does reduce complexity anyway as in the minister 's comments and recommendation for ya it essentially avoid someone having to the big confusion as to where to look in the plan if it 's in a transport zone but the rule sets in the commercial chapter so by setting in the temporary rules for the transport own it it seeks to make it clear right thanks for that additional information thank you great so we 've got four we 've got five and six seven I just think that maybe we 'll put that one on hold and deal with that next week as well because I 'm just I 'm just a little not i 'm just really unsure about it actually okay yeah recommendation age straightforward yep nine you thought that was great 10 and then we 've got the trying to reduce the complexity of the the rules passed the ebay reducing the number of categories yeah so are having exemptions rather than committed eight ER but is getting it in all three areas so I think that 's relatively straightforward yeah recommendation 12 13 14 yeah so important we just had a small amendment and the table there was a little inconsistency between recommendation 14 and recommendation 47 and I think you can I just refer refer you to the additional piece of paper that was tabled the vio changes yep draft table that 's right yep and take them through some a number and what page a vet that 's recommendation it 's okay each of the changes hopefully on page eight yep so this is just clarifying that the recommendation is not to propose any changes to the stage one definition of water body yep to have a stage two definition of water body margin and then a very small change just removing a list of examples of water body because they 're not necessary and potentially create some confusion and then as part of the of water bodies and replacing them with the terminology used elsewhere in the plan as its of clarification of the terminology used for those definitions yep recommendations 15 16 17 just on the wetlands remove classification setbacks for wetlands I couldn 't where 's recommendation 28 and can you just so it 's a mistake in the reference number it should be number 11 has a recommendation the first one is to remove the classification for wetlands because they 've already been mapped to sites of psychological significance as additional setbacks aren 't okay so we 're not being any more permissive a run what you can do around wetlands we 're just clarifying a detail Wharton we 've them what we 've done in the natural cultural heritage chapters map the extent of the wetlands rather because it 's quite difficult to interpret where the bank of the wetland is when it 's dry over the summer so rather than saying 50 meters from the bank we 're saying we 've mapped where the wetland is correct is where the rules apply okay so we 've got recommendation 18 general board signs and this is where I 'm going to invite hey all tumors Oh Jamie adds all right is he okay he just wanted to do just doesn 't I 'll be bigger i 'll be back by history i will promise I don 't care it was I don 't think we should do it 's not a big contribution I don 't think you 'll be I don 't think I 'm terribly controversial done so but if there is a if there 's going to be a photo hostages that we don 't _"

    "text": "there 's no nonotification for temporary military training activities no notification there is there 's no clause removing the need for notification for temporary military training so do people currently get notified but it 's going to happen the current plan doesn 't have rules around temporary military training activities so we 're introducing them at the request of as IDF because they 're across the nation introducing these into district plans but I don 't the reasons for notification or the lack of as what has been raised by the mere previously right okay recommendation 13 this is reward recommendation 14 straight forward straight forward your utilities minute range 15 straight utilities and energy yes I raise recommendation 15 yes recommendatio 15 and that seems trip that was straightforward all right we 're not recommending any change around utilities well we 're going through them one by one yeah but so there 's no rig no amendment written in dirt that 's right we thought all up all the ones on page 10 and 11 so that 's through to 18 we 're straight forward okay cool yep 16 what just let 's just get straight can you just explain a bit more what you 're doing on terms of 22 also I guess once we pull through and deleting Stettin Haven Herald also there was no good revival ape with what was in the rural quarry chapter and so we 've just removed that overlay so we 're not in any way reducing the assessment that would have to do if people wanted to put on Raw rejected stayed the same as understand and it 's just some deletions from my chapter from utilities 22 this one yeah utilities and energy these rules duplicate those on chapter 12 6 so they 're just a duplication yes yeah recommendation 23 recommendation 24 25 26 27 I get easier or removing assessment matters now here 's the recommendation says there are some change they discussed further down and I a button right same thing twice noticed in a later point but yes there are some changes to include essentially and advise night sitting out we knew you would apply so you can point out that but you 're not doing ozone yep 28 28 and you might want to discuss sorry Ellie we are built on 28 for other the minister 's comments relates to reduce consenting around an earth works as one of the issues there does that relate to foundations yes would there is how of an exemption in the earthworks section for structures that have a building consent so if they 've been building consent for a tower building or something then they don 't need to comply through it but there are some that don 't require a consent does that mean that this additional what I would see is an additional protection if you like is removed or reduced as a result of the recommendation from Minister you 're more concerned about residential is this is about utilities and energies check this chapter so I need to display here alright recommendation 29 is straightforward for 30 this one do you want to speak to that any questions about 30 there 's no change 31 32 there should be some response so have we done that rigorous assessment of those areas time related to housing specifically not related to this particular chapter that comment or except by if you had a fuel tanks and a little tongue I think it 's a pretty good example a utility that 's going on a high hazard area yeah I gusta allison is a chapter five deals with hazards rather than this chapter so that does deal with infrastructure and utilities in his those areas and those petrol tanks at littleton other subject also of further information that 's going to the hearings panel that stage one natural hazards chapter hearing has not closed that 's fine so maybe what we need to sign here we are doing the rigorous assessment of areas pros to be made of bridge into the for activities in terms of utilities and energy and will prevent that will not increase the risk for natural hazards and will provide a full of creation in SVT whatever we thought it did we have the explanation under 32 analysis on that and the natural hazards chapter rawness chapter well then maybe they 're just make it an appt cross-reference ears yeah that 's also around the would want something in utility saying having explosive fuel tanks and a high hazard area the assessment shows that XYZ is the rules if you want to have them in there well those are in that chapter though not in this chapter will do cross referencing to the natural hazards chapter okay yeah I mean it 's almost like recommendation 31 doesn 't belong here at all hmm which is why he had not not applicable we 're right okay right and 32 we thought they were all straight forward down at the bottom of page 17 33 34 35 36 37 38 and you might want some discussion about that do you want to ok so the minister 's comments with it the buffer zone wasn 't appropriate and all the places where I included it and I agree so I 've amended some of those provisions in talita some of them can you see that in your document but i guess the intent of the buffer was to prevent something large being erected in front of someone we wanted to see and we didn 't want it to applicable in all the areas i included it so so you feel that you 've got self sufficient protection for those outstanding features of our wonderful environment yep laughter it 's difficult where it comes to footpaths because of their nes and but there are provisions and ian is that say where the site is identified as being of high visual amenity I think is the word that the district plain rules to apply where it 's on the same side of the road to use a phone pole to put up cellphone sites utilities would be kind of might want to have some buffer is weird to ride reserved by our senators true where it 's not a row deserves they would need and just the new rules as normal would apply so yes if you 're in front of it and within the students are in distance of a heritage building you would need can see but at the moment there be a button and to some things like more more outstanding natural landscapes significant ridge lines which is quite good isn 't it and I 've retained of the buffers that you 're removing no glad they are spelled out in say where they have you 'd have to go to the utilities and energy chapter Mustapha said yeah yeah so they want to take 13 example at t1 what page 1300 utilities an energy chapter come shutup I so it 's vacation nine of the 12 people inside at some nine and change there is that too you 'll see that struck out I and added E and then that 's means our house is throughout the chapter so I 'm not requiring buffer to if g h ni so you 're taking away from a suburban residential yes same we don 't need a buffer to their zone let 's just that one zone is all you 're doing is removing at one 's own now from fgh and I if so our side of ecological significance yeah all right okay trip line of a significant tree 20 meters of a heritage item and the suburban residential yeah you do and why would you like I still struggling to understand why you do that now few shafts to in those areas for example that I 'm the hero to drive more he has a 20-metre seatback included and a slight a big load up the significance is not necessarily about the view to it it 's about puts in it rather than rather than being able to see clearly and I think the other thing is that these areas are doing not we 're utilities would be established all right so like Charlton chart child 's with Wheatlands for example you could you 'd have no buffer they could just put holes up yep well assuming it decidedly clergy were significance but then there are already poles there and yes sure okay I mean I can just go to Kinston like if they can 't see why we do that thing is perfect lots of perfectly other good land available for some of these things so you want that that you want to vote on this separately so would you like to move that this not be proceeded before sometimes moving amendment so that we can just deal with it amendments on page 18 so batter invest buffers from trees on page 18 no I 'm looking at the stream in Datia 38 recommendation 38 on page 18 reject the officers recommendation to remove buffers from truth bubba the from truth is it just the tree ones you want it all all of the buffers sorry all of them ya know take out the word from trees virginia officers recommendations to remove buffers to remove buffers that 's right so do I have a seconder for that view I felt I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye oh there 's a place I know no yeah no I 'm not no I 'm not supporting the amendment or look let 's just have a boat so we just have a hand boat those in favor put your hand up that 's for and against hands up that 's for also the amendment fails so we will then move on so it takes us through two recommendation 13 add notes clarifying relevant national environmental sneeze a very straightforward yep except recommendation 40 na that 's good that 's buzzy picking up the you 're proposing a new assessment matter for fuel tanks in addition to this is a minute yeah yeah and then recommendation 41 mounting of solar cells 19 months yeah 41 42 43 44 you might want to consider there there were proposing changes so no one type to buy an exceeds the total height 20 meters as opposed to 15 well it 's his it says to better align the provisions with the technical report so I assumed that it was better so I think there was something few well I I guess I mean to do the words to try and read better a few times and somehow I lost sight of the fact that the technical reports did the Popol could be 50 meters and then the turbine occurs took up another five above that and it would be okay so it was just a amendment to reflect that and this might not be the right place for it or whatever but their issues around noise related to their door said and a different um throughout she 's with noise for wind turbines particularly residential areas and address it is interests thank you ok and then so I think that 's fine and then 43 yeah we just don 't do it so I 'm just I 'm just confused so you 're saying you agree the restriction operator to an industrial size is not formed warranty so are you removing any restrictions on industrial zones but keeping them in further residential yes yes correct so that the rule that 's an excerpt of only applies to wind turbines and industrial in rural zones and but it included there that long sexton deleted it was really about protection in residential areas but the rule is the previous ones I mean that in AI didn 't follow them and delete that before so you 're basically just deleting the hours of operations and industrial and residential there be any buffer like we 've got industrial right next to residential they still need to comply with the with the noise development noise standards and the ferry on the edge of a boundary that find it quite difficult or probably impossible as the current technology and so there is essentially in a rural area light side up and then saw that because there 's least kind of I forget we call it white and always all that background noise so in the city you 've got a lot of you know other noise and a peninsula we 've had a little quiet village and it 's pretty quiet at night if you had the sound of wind turbines constantly going it could be quite quite an impact what I think you still need to comply with it most provisions and those avena sisters being appropriate for for those zones and I agree that there 's probably least other noise and these deadlines but again they dwell until I much space much further apart and rural areas so what 's the worst that could happen under if taking this roll-up you get a wind farm next to a little village that 's not its own wind farms it 's about small individual turbines but this is free mother said sorry if I 'm misunderstood this I thought this wasn 't affecting the residential areas that 's not just again I think area vulnerable activity people live in people live in rural areas and unjust mindful to protect them from having a winter by going all night that would be quite annoying a little what 's the current role to control yeah terms of it but when one turbines which sure not quite sure what you mean by there or are they allowed to operate between 10 and 7 a.m. at the moment there are no rules right celebrating new Royals towing basically if we keep the certain they could still operate like that if they got a concede that just had tiny differences that means that need to concede like you via that need a consent if they want to top right outside of those time restrictions relief that I would have to get a consent if we wish we then be subject to maybe there 'll be pointless forcing people to get a consent of no one could hear them yeah and annoy statements and always standard the doctor designed to protect against their I still have to comply with their I mean if they 're outside the noise people prepare base this water that 's why it doesn 't so what the alcohol policy so i put the truth district plan try to control alcohol of this policy in place yeah next one utilities and energy it 's known you over that line shall be erected an area where no overhead utilities exist very good recommendation 45 now that 's the key wants to come back for that so okay so we can we put that one on hold and so you want to leave all the Ripper Graham ones then go on to schools and tertiary on page 27 yep okay sorry okay okay I don 't think so Thank You ones where I 've got you but somebody did raise and schools i think it was canceled your handsome was about every time so an age 27 and a spiral-bound document it 's a specific purpose zone alright so sorry recommendation for 48 are we doing no yes yes it 's no modification little right that 's right kind of take us through there 's any significant changes that you 're recommending around the education and kind nothing terribly major some of the recommendations were actually who not change objectives and policies I guess is one changing my dad to the policy and rules that we have with regard to alternative users four school sites of education use and no longer requires all or part of that site I think the crown wanted there to be promoted activity status for alternative uses in accordance with the listings we got in the school zones and that 's actually what we had any operative plan there was a bit of debate internally about that and whether that was the appropriate status and I did have restricted discretionary and the proposal for back to the permitted activity status of the operative plan so that 's kind of not actually a big change in the standard friends there 's none of nothing terribly controversial about any other proposed officer recommendations sorry no no to you sorry which one on on the first one and then I and the office of recommendation I think that 's about that word any and probably is pointed out both the crown comments in also to actually require that we mitigate all adverse effects and that sense of any so all I 've done is take out the word any so it still seems mitigating adverse effects so what yeah it 's not a bogey either really yeah next one what sorry which recommendation are we doing 51 so I still just want to go through thing okay I just need to go through 50 as well so the rewrite of that policy under 26.6 21.6 point 1.2 yeah that 's the same point really the original wording was a little bit different a bit and it kind of talked about captaining a copy here that far adverse effects hello maintain the immunity of neighborhoods surrounding education sites and that was considered to be potentially in terms of maintaining immunity and exactly the same state potentially an achievable course is always going to be some effects in the fair minor okay I it 's more permissive um I guess that 's kind of what realistic actually is probably a bit of weird okay and we 're not and just just sorry at a high level to being used for education purposes revert back to their underlying zoning well yes we 've got a kind of a slightly complex situation which I work go back to clean with it but yeah the designating authority can use the site forum its underlying purpose and our planets actually schools but then we also have a listing of what we would see that so I 've been able to be used for and you can do that as an alternative yes which is generally speaking residential zoning of his attentions learning learning that surround the schools that we haven 't had any list of schools who were intending to lift the designation okay so so far there hasn 't been any lifting of designations as a result of the schools and restructuring that 's occurred but it could be in you know medium Tim all right so did still in assessment of say he took philipstown school it was developed into like l3 housing with the community have any rights to be notified or do any kind of other public processes where people could be involved in what of the because I know because it 's an elf what I thought but it probably wouldn 't be really puts in an industrial ro so in effect of a so and it could be redeveloped as industrial because it 's an accordance bit surrounding changes so it 's the underlying zone exactly the rules of the underlying zone apply so if they need a role for instance servers and under the industrial chapter if they need some kind of consent that 's what they 'd have to go for because the actual designation for a school would be uplifted does it make sense doesn 't it in a situation that 's already pertained in christchurch you know since at least 1995 i think with the young proposed friend every bill always require an alternative zone so that it was kind of giving people what could occur on that side yeah it 's also easier to a provider because actually at this time we really do need flexibility yeah all right so on to recommendation 51 and a lot straightforward 52 notice they were saying no change the Slender Man Montana f that sorry what are you breaking induction anyone montana f basically actually still is this recommendation 51 that was just a questioning by the government departments of effect that we 'd make some changes and the mapping and phase 2 versus phase one which really only results from the fact that we didn 't review the education zones and phase one so the montana avenue and i think you might have picked up earlier and earlier discussions as university mean to end all of it except for one pass walls already owned by the university and views for things like accommodation for visiting academics in office users etc but in the medium term they 're talking about using that blamed for future student hostels in actually I had understood last year that they were talking about kind of in the next two or three years but i heard recently that they 're now pushing it out to mall out sort of maybe ten years away because of budgetary issues and now in a residential neighborhood no longer has a residential neighborhood be kind of the person that lives there now it 's gone from a residential neighborhood to it yeah I agonized about that but i think that basically in the longer term and they will end up probably being bought out or effectively deciding to move if the university is attempting to have higher intensity direct he 's all around them that 's fun i mean i think we had this debate previous base I just have my vote against it again yeah I just think that we 'll deal with that at the at the end so I mean if you just want to note the ones that I mean I 'm it 's perfectly fine if we can find a mechanism just for those that that you know voted against things along the way during the informal process that they have that confirmed on particular issue so we 'll just note that one the recommendation 52 _"

    "text": "sorry now what page you referring to so you have to kind of go to 127 and and check so the problem with the minister 's submissions as comments is that these recommendations that aren 't recommendations that are included in the text so in the text in relation to cory 's there 's a number of things that they 've committed on that they want us to respond to that we don 't have any response that 's right we are sponding only to the recommendations we had to have a particular regard to the minister 's comments and the recommendations yeah so this is his comment and I just personally think in terms of the I support what we 're doing around the core in China trying to justify our position but i think it is useful to jump to respond to his comments around those dates and they are they which page is that sorry um 60 for the agenda 53 of the government 's comments and paragraph 282 if you refer to page 138 of your table there is a discussion that does respond to the touring and the rural quarry zone so we have responded and there 's a discussion there and the recommendation is that we add some additional analysis to our section 32 we believe that we the the data that data is based on research and latest data that we had to Commission as part of this development of this chapter it was referenced already in the section 32 so we just saying suggesting or recommending that we will add to that discussion to make sure that the reasoning is well covered off and justified but it doesn 't relate back to the rules that we have under 17.6 it 's talking about a different section sorry I 'm having difficulty following where you are reading from okay so only at Jimbo yeah ok so the minister 's comments 64 or 53 of the minister 's comments paragraph 2 8264 of the agenda yeah yeah hurry up to 80 to your specific reference to certain roles 17.6 six point two point one they 're probably easier to look at 17.5 point two point three because they read the rules actually written dear date remains the same hour prior to the theater at the bank ball yup 2018 but there 's no discussion as to why that time frames appropriate or justified as per the minister 's comments it is of clarity exists in relation to cuaresma proposal they should not be arbitrarily limited to 20 18 the need for new houses in a quarry zone needs an explanation of limitation of 17.6 point2 points3 to april 2018 needs to be justified what is the purpose of the 30th abate for all 2018 just like mr. clarify am back when we last spoke to you about the provisions one of the key issues that this district came with you was trying to address was really help rehabilitation of quarries and making sure that quarry sites are rehabilitated and we had some concern about the importation of materials that aren 't excavated from the site so I macquarie gravels that excavated from somewhere else being brought into an existing quarry and processed so the effect of it is to potentially extend the life of a quarry and definitely so that date that April 2018 that there are some benefits to that particularly and earthquake recovery but after 2018 we want to have the ability to assess those sort of proposals and an ability to decline them so that they can 't happen in perpetuity and in terms of the evidence for that tapping table guys please page 141 of your table we didn 't discuss it right 14 but quite briefly because the six and duty to report considers it in a bit more quite a bit more detail so effectively always saying is that we have covered it we have a sister that is in our section 32 report but perhaps we could provide some further analysis if necessary but other than that no change so which particular one has the date sorry I can 't you took me the rule all them and I don 't know the the minister 's made a comment and I just want to see your response to that calming so come on page 141 during our sister people in this is coming to center so that the last row on page 141 where it says rural and then we say the section 32 report including the background report sets out the basis for the two 2018 limitation all right sorry didja didja so we cover it off yeah we 're is this what page so that 's under the previous recommendation 113 where we talked about the excavation to the one meter so the effect yeah on so on page 127 which one through nine so the effect of the resolution that has just been made is that those changes won 't be undertaken so because we 're reverting back to non-complying activity we won 't need to undertake the the proposed revision of wording which all the strikeouts so because we 're it 's coming back as a non-complying activity will the public notification cause will be retained changing the discretionary to non-compliant I think we need to be really clear about also changing the public notification that 's what I had meant by any consequential amendment but you could add on it including the notification yeah no no that the one at the top for six point two point one after the words and problem including obviously restoration of the public notification great contessa thank you provisions yeah no no it 's fine she she accepts it yeah there 's a good process all right so um given that we 've now lost here for a while let 's go back to page one and it 's just work through the document and what I propose that we do is that with a little bit late have we kept recovered all the key no just for the quarrying so that I thought we had what we 're going to do is we 're going to go through the document we 're going to check off the ones that we 're good with and anything that we 've got you know a flag on them we 'll come back and deal with at the end because they 'll be the contentious issues but we 've done the quarrying one now and we 've identified the seams and the other one can I just what why don 't we tune to things like the seems nearly just to get them at away because would have agreement to be here that 's why she 's going to try and get back so it splits just fine shoot through the paper but I mean the idea is that we just basically sign off all of the ones that are straightforward simple clear easy to resolve and then we 'll sort of deal with the flagged issues it means all right so eyes down and looking page one recommendation one that one 's the office of recommendation as a lion water just keeping Alice CNN that 's a tic recommendation to consider the use of soda sorry that 's on page to page two you might want to consider whether or not you agree with not accepting the the minister 's comment so it 's but difficult cause this one 's over the page consider the use of other regulatory and planning processes where there is possible duplication that oh no that one was straightforward let us straight forward straight forward yep the next one down on page two whether you agree retains out of liquor alcohol subsection of general rules chapter four the minister recommended removing the sub alcohol act but this recommendation is gives reasons for retaining those provisions in the district plan well it 's just that we 're going to notify the local alcohol plan this week so do you think that would make a difference well the the provisions in the district plan are complementary to what 's in a local alcohol policy so the minister is recommending because we have a local alcohol policy would be a better approach to dealing with those issues but actually even the proposed local alcohol policy is complementary to what is in the district plan so I 'm retaining are recommending retaining the district plan provisions after that reason but but why do we need to have the sale of alcohol provisions and the plane but what do they add to the plane so the local alcohol policy doesn 't have specific rules around we 're on licenses can be located and what the district plan rules do is a restrict sale of alcohol after 11pm within 75 meters of residential zone so what it does in some of the smaller centres is effectively require them to National sorry so the district plan introduces regulation thats related to the LAN g-sec tivity so it has a restriction on location and and noise in relation to operation and in that sense that 's what the hours of operation about that 's correct it 's consistent with what 's in the local alcohol policy and there 's also Parisians in the central city that are also consistent with its a normal person it 'll be one ie my toes I think it 's a real even team it 's 11pm in the centers and then in the central city there 's noise and entertainment precincts which have different hours and saima closer one name so what happens if so is seeing you this is surely the lepers the beater way to go about it because I can just see so many anomalies that someone 's living in not what we 're not gonna have high rise but say say an apartment complex which is near an entertainment precinct to the in say that there was an area over they were shuttered leavin p.m. even though these people have made sorry what I need to explain is that you haven 't had the central city chap to come to you and that has its own set of rules so the set of rules here is for everywhere else in the city but not for the central city so it 's likely to be the 1pm rule in the rules for the central city the only a point of us but this is only applying to even for revenues outside of the for revenues this is everywhere outside of foreign yes because lyst I 'm just wondering so the wonder bar would have to shuttle even being given given that we 're coming in Littleton given that we 're coming back to the plan next Wednesday I 'm wondering whether we could get an update on this because you wouldn 't have known that we 're going to improve that la pava note a notification tomorrow so and I kind of want to see what happens ok I 'll bring it back to next Wednesday 's you say as we 're coming back to it in any way it 's just I don 't understand is why why it can 't all be dealt with in the one and the local alcohol plan rather than the local alcohol policies I understand it is under the local government act yeah no it 's a sale and supply or alcohol sorry but it can 't put in place land use rules only the district plan can do that in these rules are relating to the land-use activity of selling alcohol which is location and hours of operation because of the noise etc and the and the difficulties that can go with hours of operation so that means that in riccarton you can 't because there 's a residential property over the road you can 't operate after 11pm at night but it depends on the location it 's it needs to be within 75 meters of a residential area so if it 's far enough away then I would still be able to and it only requires a consent for it to continue tell anybody on there okay yeah so just a question how would that relate on the banks peninsula where we as I came in Jamie mentioned the wonder bar in littleton and littles is a good case in point where we would hope that the future local economy of littleton would be based on hospitality and entertainment as key parts of the economic development met but the very nature of the area that the wonder bar for example is in is that it 's a commercial residential mix from a zoning viewpoint by taking this precinct approach we neva tily as i understand it make it more difficult for a late night license business to establish and shut in such a place or even to make changes to its operation in such a place despite that 's run in the past without any real problems it will depend on the size of the center so the center 's are large enough that there 's lots there are more than 75 meters from that boundary with residential which i think is clarified that mixed-use doesn 't is it within that definition of residential but I can check that which I can clarify that it did a consideration is in the Christchurch around trying to direct these activities into the noise and entertainment precincts in the central city so that 's part of the direction that we need to be consistent with indices therapy so we can come back to and and just cheap for example we 're the wonder bar certs and whether it is an within 75 meters of a residential properties just when you see these things here I 'm not going to be able to actually think of everything in its you can never find perfect i know that doesn 't exist but generally you know if you 're going out with friends like that it 's quite normal on saturday night to pop out in a me today to clock matter at every turn or something done it comes Ellis to the nine therefore your Trevino 's or something when you 've got residential literally within that 75 meters that you they couldn 't shut up shop you know you could be getting you know having dessert or something at live in a clock it seems would that would this fall under there and say you just a soul square type party zone this is to do with the sale of alcohol only it 's not closing the restaurant I so it means that you couldn 't have a glass of wine and the live and i won we 've provided yeah one thing your time so you couldn 't if you were out with friends on a saturday night in Trevino 's in its anarchy in a hub outside of the CBD they couldn 't serve it 1101 a glass of wine when you 're having dessert or something on a cell phone they wouldn 't need a consent to be able to sell after 11pm i can they would need a consent i conceived yet okay okay so it 's just it 's just yeah just really but we 're not talking about the central city yeah yeah I see all right so let 's just have some further feedback on the post lab so if the if the let goes through do we do we still need to have this legal framework I 'd like to get some more legal background that yeah my cannon canto and the district plan is the vehicle for land use rulings but I 'd like to get some legal advice on that just point me to where the minister 's comments we 're on the cell blocker sale of alcohol sorry paragraph 19 recommendation six ones are in the use of other planning processes to avoid duplication such as the stones if I they 'll collect yeah but where 's the where 's their actual then they go through and go through were dancing I mean they obviously think that that it 's enough do other district plans have these provisions in the district plan as well yes some do I 'm certainly aware of a couple that do only if you 're looking for the minister 's comments on it if you look into attachment 1 which is the minister 's comment yeah and go to the ones with the fourth page which is under the on the numbering on the top right hand corner page 15 you know nine I see there but I haven 't seen the detail around the sale of liquor I mean 15 2 and 5 20 here we go right yep that 's where it 's talked about yes so what are you saying us as the section 32 analysis confirms the use of this part of the draft general rules proposal to restrict trading hours and the absence of a lamp is required by the egg the adoption of a lack would seem to be a more appropriate method than the inclusion of this section and the draft proposal what I 'm not clear about is a what what strength philip has to direct any land use type activities like distance away from other entity residential zones and things like that and that 's what I 'd like to get some further legal advice on okay currently does someone have to get a consent to operate at certain hours like they want to go past deliver call do they have to Karen Lee get it to the scene yes this is the same role as is in the city plan yeah maybe what the issue is is that maybe the maybe I mean I 'm not I haven 't_''_1319.27 familiarized its Caesars that it only deals with the the two district the two parts of the central city it does it not deal with the rest of the city well the lab deals with the entire city but it doesn 't deal with the interface between residential zones and where locations where alcohol is sold because when they developed the local alcohol policy they were depending on the district plan having these provisions that covered that issue so the current draft lab doesn 't include those rules and in order to insert them with the states of the lap is on at the moment would mean having to go back no no and we 're not going to do that but in a way yeah okay all right so it may be that really the the office of reasons really need to be restricted to 2.4 but anyway let 's have a look at that once we 've seen what the lip contains and okay yep okay recommendation 3 that 's all straight aboard it 's straightforward recommendations or you might want to consider and we 're officers are recommending so there 's a recognition by the minister to provide for emergency services facilities I 'm so there 's two recommendations a response to this one is to schedule fire stations on the banks peninsula and the other is in the temporary activities to add emergency response training it I don 't think we should have any fire stations on the banks man I think you 'd be okay with it I 'm not going to disagree but I did have one question which was this little some fire station is missing from appendix 1 you 've got all the other ones that i can think of there but littleton is missing from the appendix the industrial general zone which is already permitted for emergency services facilities so there is no reason to schedule the scheduling gives additional development rights for fire stations when their residential zones but because it 's in an industrial zone it didn 't it didn 't require scheduling what a great answer okay okay so that 's a tick recommendation 5 we just thought that was straightforward yep recommendations 6 recommendation for eid emergency sorry the fire stations but the ones around emergency response training activities as a permitted activity yeah like so we 've had the issues in the red zone for example so is it any sort of notification requirements that we have attached it includes standards for noise so if they were exceeding the noise limits and they 'll be required to get a consent this is pretty frightening when you see what you know people with guns running through your neighborhood or close to your neighborhood and you haven 't been notified I mean I think when they organize these activities they generally have their own protocols around notification so it 's a question of whether or not we want to have a district plan will know that requires that well I think we do need some safeguards I mean we saw fires I think there 's some fires out in the halls will area over one of the exercises we 've seen people frightened and adjacent to the red zone so I think there 's an area that we can improve yeah but it 's not a district plan meter want to consider you know writing to the appropriate services that were involved in those activities and advising them of the concerns of citizens but it would be inappropriate for us to put a regulation into the district plane around around those uses we 're just simply saying that it 's a promoted activity but they have to comply with noise standards but but isn 't that what we 're doing by adding it into a district plan is making a digital plan I think the main purpose batting it is to clarify that it 's a permitted activity just in case there was any ambiguity about that because we have permitted activity for temporary military training activities we have not like the noise standards for the emergency response training activities so just to clarify that it is a permitted activity that 's the main reason for including it okay today recommendations six why do you think that that was controversial recommendations seven or seven or eight seven and eight recommendation nine over the page we thought that was read forward the next one we thought you might want to the three kilometer and 800-meter bootstrap management areas on both the planets and online that 's so the concern that the administration us here was that in some cases because the map that we were in the draft only was showing the three kilometer area and there might be some difficulty for applicants and determining if they were in the kilometer area so we 've changed the map to add both areas and they were also recommending having that isn 't overlay on the planning maps but I 'm not recommending that because I think there 's already quite a few over later on planning maps and the significance of some of the rules isn 't isn 't that great but there will be something that 's going to be easy to do when we are all digitized anyway isn 't it yeah so it 's just it 's adding a PDF yeah inline map that people can download so they can see where the 8 kilometer area is and determine whether or not they 're in that area yep all right good I raised the issue around non-residential activities back to that which one is it well it 's related to this um nine so that we 've just quickly done but sorry what do you want to raise um nine so so one of the issues is like this is around you non-residential activities occurring and non zoned activities happening within certain zones and I just wanted really an understanding of what these changes actually mean in terms of that current plan our current proposal because they apply to historic activities which when the plan was change from the district 's came to the district plan would have required a consent so before prior to nineteen ninety-five they would have been permitted activities in residential zones post 1995 they would have required complying our discretionary consent so things like service stations and spiritual facilities in this eventual zones so what we 've done is change the wording basically of the objective and policy because we were referring to them as out of zone activities but the point that the minister made was that actually spiritual facilities shouldn 't really be described as out of zone because this they 're appropriate in those areas so I 've changed from Adams these two established activities so it 's really just a question of how they 're being described in the objective in policy and under 6.5 point one one one so we 're we 're enabling schools for example to expand and prime residential areas it seems kind of counterproductive to where we want people living so what is set point five point one one one doing the purpose of that is to give a policy framework for scheduled activities which are is a list of historic activities that were already existing supposed to make it easier for them to expand yes it 's a clarify what the purpose of the scheduling is which is to allow them a limited envelope of expansion on the sites that they 've historically been on while still being consistent with the objectives and policies for new activities and residential which is generally should direct them to the center 's so we don 't say like if you want to knock down your church and put up a multi-story you know sort of entertainment come have to be tested against this well the scheduling only applies to expansion of the church itself yeah if another activity came along and wanted to use that site no no I meet the church tuning itself older they are loud this is hurtling allows them a limited amount of expansion but not right and unlimited it 's just to allow them to allow a little bit of expansion on their own site but not to not to an extent that undermines so I don 't support that sorry what what 's your problem with it because what we 've seen is that something starts out really small and then it keeps buying up the neighboring properties and so originally when it was established it might have been a school with a role of 50 then becomes a school of 200 and it actually takes over entire block that previously was residential but then ends up becoming completely educational so to me it just seems a bit of a fast that I mean I have no problem with historic facility activity has been able to redevelop within their existing making it easier for people to expand on outside of their initial footprint and if you take residential I mean I 'm residential high-density residential having a single-story school it just seems that doesn 't even increase the whole school sends a really poor use of land these are all I just point out that this it 's got the only thing that has changed in this is the weirdest tablished you 've actually signed this off for the majority of the actual objective and policy it 's just the use of the wording that has changed you 've actually signed this off as an activity yeah it went to the ministers the only thing that that Ellison is trying to point out to you is the change of the tube within the objective and policy so they 're removing references to out of zone that 's right to established activity established activities it 's the only change there so so we can 't relitigate out we can 't relocate what already has gone to the minister so that was with done teen number 11 military training activities and that it all right okay we thought 12 was quite straightforward 12 sorry can we just um on 11 can we can we introduce a public notification _"

    "text": "and if anything was streamed before this point in time just just just forgive us just forgive us we didn 't know that we were on public display so the dipping Amir has just advised me that her meeting doesn 't start it 12th idiot starts at one o 'clock so we have decided to do the big issues first which quarrying seems and sex star so can you highlight for us the quarrying recommendations so just tell us which page to refer to and 125 yep okay so so that just in a in a in a nutshell tell us what the request was from the minister what officer recommendation is what your reasons are and and we 're with what you 're recommending to us terms of the rule chapter overall the minister provided a number of comments and recommendations largely relating to ensuring that the rural chapter was in line with the revised sorry the decision on strategic directions statement of expectations in the order and council so it is in response to those comments one of the would I what I have recommended as originally we with the rural environment I now recommending that we no longer need to do that because the way that the strategic directions decision has come out and it 's dealing with some high level issues relating to activities across the city with a focus on recovery and in my view issues relating to rural areas and activities can be adequately dealt with at the rural chapter level and as a result of that this recommendation plus on 125 plus there is another recommendation on page 130 that has resulted in a revision or amendment two objectives and policies in the rural chapter not changing their intent but merely reflecting the fact that no longer going to add to strategic directions in largely following from the minister 's comments about clarity interpretation ensuring that outcomes are clear and not confused within objectives and policies so the intent of it has not changed it 's merely clarifying the purpose of the rural chapter it 's on it works were not helpful comedy in the slightest and so we had gone we had actually written to the minister saying we actually wanted it while you were wailing yeah and he replied and so what we 've got here is restricted what you 're suggesting is restricted discretionary yes and so just remind me where this comes on the hierarchy of what so the hierarchy is Roberto e worst is prohibited yeah very beast in this case yes and then it 's discretionary coming down one then it 's sorry then it 's non-complying then it 's discretionary and then it 's restricted discretionary we 're actually going from prohibited which we asked to restricted discretionary we 're going out three steps of the leader in terms of tolerance of this we didn 't look better than did we I just describing with the one the meetings when you 're away yes I know but we we were told that we couldn 't know well we wrote to the minister saying things yes I know but the minister 's since reply to the other so before that we were looking at non-compliant yes and now we 're changing from non-complying through discretionary to restricted discretionary the officers recommendation as they used to be consistent son is been advised by ekn we can commissioners when we meet with them that that it doesn 't that is a minimum requirement not that 's not the limit so so they they could fully appreciate why we want to protect against something that was never anticipated which is multiple multiple sites at once exposing the expert that 's so just in terms of what we can do legally in terms of this document can we now go to prohibited no okay because we can 't_''_357.05 because the minister hasn 't directly so can we go to non-complying where we were we can leave it at non-complying yeah that 's the best that we quit we can reject we can reject the graph the staffs advice and such an to suggest noncom public remain it no I 'm fine so you 'd like to move that just like you would like to move there so if we could it should be in Riyadh easy then set 1 11 13 on page 126 127 recommendation 113 yeah on the spiral bound copy yep on page that 's the one to the officers responses underneath on the right-hand side yes on pages 49 to 53 specifically paragraph 258 so it should rip on pages for pages of all 127 or through to 129 the rule sets on 127 to 129 change restricted discretionary no such change and you 're restricted discretionary to non-complying or leave non-complying as it was actually you know but we have to yet okay what we 're doing is amending the officers recommendations to non-compliance for the 1-meter cattrall does it make sense yeah you made a mention Brigitte then the reason for that and it 's referred to in that blue line recommendation 113 is that it relates to the regional policy statements correct as far as consistency guys now where is there being a number of things that have been raised today that we had bought debt but have to do because we are directed to do so and in order to be consistent with other things i 'm talking about the minister 's recommendations in the early May yeah right so if this is something that we would like to do as I would is there any point in doing it if in fact it is not consistent and it 's just going to get kept back well the argument is prop that is probably the debating measure so I can sorry no well in one sense that I mean did is the whole point and I said this at the outset that we 're going to find ourselves in a position where we are asking staff to notify a document that we know has not met the minister 's expectations but the minister 's expectations in this regard have been predicated on the basis that that unconditional syston see with the with the regional plan is is something that that should be avoided in this case the regional plan was never ever determined on the basis that you would have multiple applications into the into the groundwater exposing the groundwater at multiple sites all at once so yeah absolutely we can any came will support us so I think that we should make it very clear that when that we the recommendation change the restricted discretion is non-compliant for the one meter or it is because the the relevant provisions and the regional policy statement never anticipated multiple exposures of the ground water too it took to you know to yeah yeah whatever the word yeah but yeah so um sorry can 't hear when we have to give evidence talk about the economic implications of any contamination of our groundwater aquifers because those although it 's more Environment Canterbury commissioners head indicates support indicated support for this position I think we just we don 't want to say that they had actually because I don 't even vote or anything from eating they don 't vote I know and any consequential amendments if you don 't mind yes just a month hang on can we just deal with it one at a time so now as that is this is this on that is this just this is just the since that recommendation is now wide enough to pick up any other changes that need to be made no I if you don 't mind at the end of each one and any consequential amino example we 'd need to amend the put there that will allow us to make changes when these rules are referred to another place as if they are yeah yeah it needs to yeah ya ali i think is wanting to second this yeah because I think that what we 're trying to do is we 're trying to establish that you know we have taken into account what the ministers have seed but we don 't think that the ministers have taken into account the fact that the regional policy statement you know sort of it was it 's another lifetime compared to the situation that we are now you have had a particular regard to the comments correct absolutely there wasn 't a party to or the ministers to these discussions yeah that 's right perhaps just for ease of reference if we could put just above the 6.1 Corrigan it 's just so that we can you stand what each exception there 's no sorry the six point two point one so yes I mean yes just put the little hitting quarry in or something yeah that 's right yeah that 's a little debate on that Jonnie like we 're basically if we do this we 're going to be and I just want to check with star oh sorry you use still on questions yeah if we if we do this we basically duplicating function of the Regional Council we 're not meeting the statement of expectations all the strategic directions is it correct it 's a legal point of view right a cue ball well no that 's the advice that we think of them from an officer 's perspective those are the reasons something given for changing have we got legal advice around that because I think this is a really important issue little of dice around wat sorry I 'm around what we 're proposing what do you mean legal advice well because if we 're going to do something that 's um not appropriate and we want this to go through the baggy look we 're going to get wet by that no no we need to put on evidence but and a problem is that this isn 't our evidence this is staff evidence so all we independent hearing pennell and said it 's our view that this doesn 't make the statement of expectation lets out of you that this is not appropriate we 're going to be back where we started I 'm not disagreeing with you what I 'm saying is we need to provide an evidential basis for our position the current evidential basis that we have in this document does not support position and when the staff go to the independent hearing panel and provide the evidence that they are asked to give it will not be reflecting what we want it will be reflecting what 's already written here what sort of evil don 't see something I would have thought some legal evidence would be pretty powerful around you know whether it 's appropriate or not to do the cata function the Regional Council whether in terms of the statement of expectations why it meets the segment of expectation is vector G is that the office of reasons here are they going to become part of the of the yugs little be my understanding is that if there 's disagreement would need to find another planner who is not as who was not the planner who wrote this to portray that measure through evidence right say how would you do that well we would go out and get another planner who agrees from this position to do that evidence but can we do the same for lifestyle of me well we even got to do my jaani could be just for the focus on the issues that we 're trying to address we said right from the very outset that they were going to be issues that the way that the staff have responded to the suggestions from the from the ministers have left us in a position where we 're not able to support those but for different reasons and we 're going to have to work out how we support our staff through that process because they are going to have to give evidence they are not there as advocates so and may well be that on certain issues we will want to get independent planning evidence in front of the hearings panel on our behalf so if received he makes repeated reference to the fact that our staff have changed their view on life mark assessment on environmental standards and wants us to reflect the change staff position through this a number of these proposals we 've also seen this part of an independent hearing panel that they have been quite critical of our staff over certain things particularly around the statement of expectation so you know I just don 't want to sit I just want to be clear and I support what we 're doing and I just want to really have some grunt behind it so we don 't just end up being in the same situation we were in terms of phase one where it just gets chucked out because the commissioners yeah but can we address that I mean that is another matter that is process matter and it may be if for example there wasn 't a planner to be found that could support it we would just simply have to do it through legal submissions but there is a way for this for this voice to get through in front will necessarily carry any weight as as other rules happened yeah so I think that what yannis raising and it 's a valid point is that prior to these ones going you know prior to the submissions closing we will have to add a district plan review subcommittee just sit down and talk about the strategy of certain elements of these and this is one of them because I mean you know I 've made it clear that we do kind of want to protect you guys you 're on the receiving end of the of the panel you know when when you know things are not going particularly well and you know i think that the you know behind the scenes you work really well you know with other planners from other cross government departments in order to get combined solutions you know which has been extremely positive but we want to leave you exposed either any more than Eric with us well no I understand that and thank you for your consideration we have to be professional in the advice that we give you and this is the all right so yeah no no we haven 't passed it but we 're going to have a debate about it if people would like to say a few words about it for the amendment that we 've got sufficiently colors that rural chapter 17 Corey provisions so there 's a number of other things in there that we 're we 're taking out yeah it 's just a breaching the the 1-meter role yeah we 've still got other there were no other particular points that we felt needed would concern you necessarily they 're mostly process points or clarification ports on the rest of the quarrying rolls so hang on is there is there a distance one us another 250 meters from a residential area such as the rabbits road one we didn 't have a distance in the rural zone or the quarrying zone from any residual area because we didn 't get to do that at the time so what have we got left and here so we 're not proposing any changes to those provisions that you consider on the twentieth of February 's so retained okay and then that was notified within another 250 meters but this isn 't this isn 't the it hasn 't been raised by the minister 's this isn 't in the rural chapter though no it 's in there it 's the goober thoughts issue residential chapter no it 's it 's a metal chapter so right from residential zone boundaries but we reserve a residential development right to it but what we haven 't got is any distance from any queries in the rural or querying zone for a residence so we 've got a 250 meter if you build a house and then auntie Polly notified yeah for the 250 by on but acting but if you build a quarry you can go right up to that business Dorset basically no so efforts for acquiring activity that sets were outside the rural quarry zones it 's a discretionary activity unless you 're within 250 metres of a residential zone and then it jumps into a non-complying activity so as part of that discretionary activity status any effects on adjoining residential buildings will be considered and part it 's all part of consideration of a discretionary activities status so we haven 't_''_1287.4 we can down at the stage anything that but no right okay so it 's fine and we 've left the 500 meters for the residential notification all right so yeah so the other issues like in the minister 's comments are 17.6 point to point one in 17.6 point2 points3 i don 't see any response to the timing what 's page 127 and it 's page 64 of our agenda paragraph 2 82 so says the issues of clarity exist in relation to florence and the proposal p 2 should not be limited our charity limited to 2018 and the need for new houses and Aquarius I needs an explanation the limitation of 17 points X 1 2.3 you know which pace that is in the spiral document okay manke that I 'm I 'm gonna lose the mover of them I so can-can I can we just deal with it can we pass this one before Vicky goes yeah yep okay right I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carry very _"

    "text": "and what is with the recover by the writings you wanted to clear away first as well yes madam chair just cranford Basin councils are we aware that this council has been looking at the residual land land the Highland around the edge of cranford Basin where there are two notices of requirement of designation for the extension of the motorway and also for stormwater I would request it there be a resolution to defer cranford basin and the consideration of that meta to stage three so that the matter can go to the UDS I see first to get some more consultation from our statutory partners so that 's the new resolution resolution that needs to go up so that it 's not on there anywhere at the moment Alice okay so i move that that the cramp put basin decision be deferred to stage three that 's correct that 's correct yes we want that to go through to stage three to be considered yeah yeah I 'm just I 'm and I 've moved it as anyone happy to second it this is so that the UDS Utes yes yeah yeah yeah so that 's what it 's that 's why it 's been deferred to stage three so I 've moved at Paul lonsdale has seconded so questions that is if you could just explain the reason for that I get all the people involved in that the Utes that partners it 's true to what in them would there potentially be any negative and no no in fact it would be positive and end it was a request by commissioners Commissioner Skelton you may recall that cranford Basin itself lies outside the infrastructure line which was originally called the Metropolitan urban limits it is actually rural part of the city now under the original policy statement so in order for us to zone it to an urban residential zone that would mean a change to the regional policy statement and because that statement is is the jurisdiction of the Regional Council and in the UDS members are the ones who determined where that line went originally then we would like to give them more opportunity to consider the matter before we put it through in on the twenty-seventh of june stage 3 omega 3 ok thanks ok any other questions garni consult with anyone else why are we consulting particularly with the UTS is I see because they are statutory partners and we are required to undertake that consultation its discretion with its discretionary and the Resource Management Act and the OIC whether we undertake consultation with any other parties however there are a number of statutory parties and the UDS or the members of the UDS are stitched true partners who under the OIC we have to formally consult with him over easy thing an experiment so have we done that with the other stages yes because they swear we have the collaborative advisory group and we 've also seen the statutory partners are also the government and that 's why we simply chapters to them as well in what 's the risk if we don 't do what the Minister wants us to do on this one this isn 't a ministerial request this is a sensible request that 's come through from Commissioner skeleton from Environment Canterbury because the Utes currently restricts cranford Basin if we can get the UTS partners to agree to this it 's just going to make it very noisy severe my understand was from the minister 's comments that they had the minister wanted us to treat the hanford base differently is that correct how does the minister and his comments want us to treat cranford basin well they are wanting us to be in alignment with the RPS which currently excludes cranford basis yes so now we want to talk to our secretary partners to make sure that if they all agree then it 's going to happen which we have been doing on an officer level but it hasn 't been to the Utes I see which is the implementation committee okay all right so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried now just just a few more med and matters madam chair and then I 'll go on to amendments to the recommendations in front of you you should all have a spiral bound copy that is numbered on the bottom if we questions please because it 's numbered on the bottom and I here and then there is also a much smaller document that looks the same as the spiral copy and these modifications to the larger table that officers have come up with since since this table was released and I would draw your attention to the back of it which we I 'm sure we 'll come to in due course but just so that I pointed out to you at the very back of the smaller document on page 11 there is a proposal and it goes on for two or three pages regarding the property at Riccarton racecourse that 's been developed by NATO who property limited and just to let you know that we received this proposal yesterday afternoon and we agreed that we would table it in front of you we can go through that in detail when we go through the comments that come to this is a small tiny little one yeah how you livin so the small pages are some changes to the bigger document just at the back of it I was property limited and just pointing out where it is for when we get to that measure on the table doesn 't mean that everyone I 've read it no well we will go through that with you and detail because that the pages before it actually wasn 't laughing so just some amendments I 'm sorry to the recommendations before we carry on well I was hoping to go through the recommendations because they would be in response to each item but that but they respond to each item that 's been raised it 's correct so the minister 's leader is only a covering letter yeah it 's the 93 recommendations that are found within the document attached to the minister 's Lisa that are responded to in the spiral bound copy yeah but there are overarching are made and the meter that actually relate across the board all of them yep just wonderful to the process of proceed if you could tell us which parts are going to be responded to later and yeah I was just going to do right now but what I 'm just I to make sure that we are alert to these particular are we going to just loop to the each of these as we go through doesn 't right I guess it 's fine and the next question is what we can 't deal with today yes and this relates to the recommendations if we could bring up the recommendations please and does 6.3 go back to 6.3 yep no sorry wrong one and a 6.5 there are two copies of the designations i think it 's it 's in between councillor hansen a mangy on this side and counselor livingston and east on that side just other designations for your information there is no decision you can make on those designations today except to include them in the notification all decisions relating to designations are made by the independent hearings panel but they have to be notified of course for submissions rather these two copies of those each on your desks in relation to that under 6.5 we need to add the word and the first line it says their chapters planning maps can we add the weird designation and done it I 've done it already it might be between men jian golf yes there is it 's there because the process is sent out in the order in council it 's a different process to under the RMA and the list of designations are only the council 's designations and you have actually signed on off on these or the relative committee has for these council designations there is no other decision for you to make except to include them in the plan to be notified right and there is unless they 're no we 've already said that we 've already in December there were no solutions relating to that by another committee where they had to consider what designations they wanted to come through to the district plan right so that weird designations as in there that 's correct I need to I also need to include and at the end of that recommendation and 6.5 yeah excluding open space general procedure and rules engine testing and residential stage 2 that 's correct and that 's because you really did I could just tell that that perfect the reason being is that those section 32 s haven 't been to yet and you need to consider them before we can approve them with the chapters 2 to be included and my recommendation there is that we use next week 's Wednesday 's DPR subcommittee meeting which is for one hour use that as the public meeting just to sign off those section 32 s right the other matter that isn 't whether you is the coastal environment chapter you haven 't received that chapter or the section 32 we will also bring that to you next Wednesday Nick sweden 's day yes oh it will come out to you earlier than that no no but I thought that that one was going to come up on Friday week a coastal environment is different to stage two natural hazards but they are interlinked yes it can it can go through to stage three it will depend on discussions to be had during this week if it were to go to stage three then it would come on the Friday water on the twenty-fourth the 25th not this stage three chapters to you to sign up to go to the ministers and that 's natural hazards stage two we could include coastal environment and met yeah I 'd rather try brothers that I did there yeah okay because they are interrelated and I don 't think we should have a conversation about one without the other that 's that 's perfect earlier one of the reasons why we haven 't put it up to you today yep but guys stage three okay and and then we need one through the recommendation we do you need a resolution to cover bed yes do actually actually he or can we go back down to Clinton I stood where the crimper Basin can we have another resolution saying defer the cranford basin and coastal environment at coastal environment chapter on south state street yeah yes but you did the mover and seconder of that I mean I 'd move doesn 't seconder I 'm comfortable with their will yeah yep so that that 's just to get them together with the natural hazards chapter it makes good sense to me so deem they 're all carried good thank you good process thank you and the other recommendation that I need to put in which may change when we go through the comments there needs to be a new 6.6 so before the recommendation on the little port on the Littleton port there should be another recommendation that approves the changes to the modified list of responses on minister 's comments tabled at the meeting approve the changes to the modified responses to the ministry approve the modified changes sorry that 's the small approve what wouldn 't you just say approve the changes I I just don 't know what modified changes that it 's just the title on the unnatural table that 's all I fee it 's tabled at the meeting it 's correct oh I think okay right so I 'm the document what 's that matter here thank you i think i have it off everything i need to say just a short introduction i guess to the report you 'll all be aware that the 17 proposals went to the ministers at the end of march at that time with the draft section 32 s on the twenty-third of of march we received back the minister 's comments there were 93 odd comments from the minister they are included an attachment 1 to your report therefore the very first recommendation is to receive those comments and to have particular regard to them attachment to then has the draft officer recommendations and response to each of those minister 's comments and then once we receive once we 've gone through each of these and received your comments on it we will amend the section 32 s accordingly before they are notified yep I 've got about 80 areas where are not peeing to accept the minister 's modified comments naw I have regard to what he 's saying and and i 'm not sure what the process is well that 's what I want to discuss now know which is how we you know manager you know substantial document of the hundred and odd pages so my view is that we should identify what those what those kind of exceptional issues are so that we can allow that there are a significant number of these where they are we 're simply the ministers have made a recommendation the officers are recommending that we adopt that recommendation and it doesn 't seem to me that there 's any any particular issue with those so I think if we can identify the issues that require us to devote our attention to then I think we can literally sign off the reefs so there 'll be probably four different categories so and and some of them it 's just simply that they 're minor or process related and the you know the officers have accepted the minister 's comments there will be some where officers have rejected the minister 's comments and we should just double-check that we 're comfortable with that and there are ones that the officers have accepted the minister 's comments and councillors need to see whether they 're comfortable with that but I think that on that large number of ones that we can literally sign them off on block and then focus our attention as a council on the issues that we want to by highlighting what those those issues were and I mean I 'm sure that you 've gone to the earthworks page as I have and the home star six page and I think that we 're going to find that we 're an agreement about the issues that we 'd like to debate because I think what is going to happen is that there will be some aspects of the minister 's advice which we in conscience can 't accept and we recognize at that place of staff and a difficult position because they 're there to give evidence not to promote the interests of the of the council but we have heard from our constituents we know what they are concerned about and they are concerned for example about having our groundwater exposed at several points with quarreling quarreling into the into the groundwater itself i think that the rules that allowed for that to happen on a pretty restricted basis in the past never envisaged multiple sites so and I we 've raised us with II can ourselves and they have encouraged us to to take a stronger ground to argue this but we know that we have to protect our officers from the criticism that they are trying to make the environment more restrictive for querying actually the council laws are wanting to protect the groundwater that our city is so utterly dependent on and and and we want to put up a case for stronger rules in that regard so that 's going to be sort of one of the one of the issues so I think it might be easier if we just identify what what the issues are and then perhaps because I 'm we 're going to have to take a because we 've got a meeting at eleven-thirty so I 'm just wondering whether we could identify those issues and then you could you could identify which ones of these on and the document they relate to and then we could identify an order place for the afternoon session I 'm going to look at my diary in a minute okay yep I can point usually they are when you say the home star rolls is that in relation to industrial commercial the subject matters that you want to debate these review the attachment one attachment to ever many started recommendations 93 only but why we response to the many star accommodation for hong-chih and the 53 there is the sixth either defensed okay because there are general overarching comments there are 10 of them in the very beginning of the document and some of the chapter leaders had to respond to those as well so there are 93 specific comments and then there are other more overarching comments relating to the statement of expectations that they 've also answered in certain cases are there any so we 've identified the home star that the sames the quarry 's out here out here yep Wigram write an e-mail site the character areas which will be notified I want to hear from staff over the reduction than notification requirements and a general sense just get a feel for how much they 're recommending reducing the communities right to be notified and also i mean i think one was a little bit of setbacks for example which consumed me i also want to get area we found it quite hard to understand where we were going with that and i wanted to get an understanding of particularly around what 's being done as part of phase one and now seems like the minister 's having another crack tip through phase 2 i 'm also interested in any areas with a height and scale of development as being increased significantly i think i read somewhere that it was they did want us to remove height limits and and scale restrictions so the the other one i was really wanting some more information around the use of residential areas for non-residential purposes and particularly wanted to have a bit of an understanding over though some of the designations and the open space metropolitan zones for example if we 're going to be adding things in here i 'd rather do it for the your host academy although i know you 've seen that should go through the UDI see as well but if we 're going to make changes for the minister then I think we should make changes for what we want as well just as such it 's just something that this council was proposing you know I understand that but it 's but it 's where the minister have kind of asked us to have things like open space signs and recreation zones and with a you know just what what 's happening there so sorry we 're with us page 55 55 all rights with this to page numbers so it 's page 66 of our agenda page 55 of the government 's have the spiral bound yeah and in it in some sense it would be good to have an understanding around what 's happening with the the statement of expectations all right what do you mean catwalk there 's a number of general things that you know like weeping asked to do but if you turn to page 41 align the strategic direction think of containing the earrings panel engine respond to the guidance of a budding internal reduce the unnecessary regulation and increase the use of non-regulatory methods so perhaps someone could tell me what increase of use of non registry methods we 're so much per g reading sorry ok it 's the highlighted box I 'm also just really kanga understand in terms of consenting for earthworks around contaminated land and land remediation and without whether or not there 's any legacy issues given that you know given if we 're reducing conceding requirements now we can ensure that things are being fixed properly so if we now identified all of the issues that we need to discuss yet I just like some comment on my littles part to the recommendations 339 and 340 which page is that sorry so it 's best to to ear you need to refer to the east please I don 't feel like so Oh walk pages is in here and the agenda and Regina is on page 64 so it was the minister 's recommendations 339 and 340 okay I just wanted some discussion probably up there so we really need to understand that the officers have gone through these they 've given reasons for their recommendation and and then we 're being asked whether we agree with that position so just raising that without I mean do you not at it I hadn 't_:_1652.81 I 've skim read it like everything in the document and I just wanted some discussion about it for clarity for me to be honest yeah I think so it 's a process issue in it but it 's I think this document is the key and I don 't just received it though obviously no no no no it 's just saying something that 's been with you into Italy the same document that 's in your agenda it 's just got it 's just from the page numbers on it to make it easier to traverse so I can find those things yeah you know okay Bri with the master on and it 's the cantera state at the back of the noble subdivision it talks about alternative transport out so that it 's not landlocked okay specifically relevant to education just understanding what 's happening with the education facilities on from page 73 or 62 of the government 's submission understanding about what changes have been done to signage in visual pollution and whether we 're being more enabling and the other a comment around utilities there are numbers of recommendations to those perhaps we can at that time we would just need to go to the pages that cover those particular issues and if you want to pick out particular recommendations or else we 'll have to go through them more in relation to the chapter I mean I just I 'm and some respects you know that it probably wasn 't as narrow as I thought it would be so it may be that we just have to go through the draft table page by page and but what I 'm worried about is that will end up having no time to really debate the issues of substance and that 's why I wanted to identify what those big issues we 're at the mouse here we all know the groundwaters one of them the you know the sames the homestar those sort of things that they are part of it as well and and nearly probably nearly all of the recommendations in relation to residential critical for you to understand and be aware of okay raised if there 's national council chambers yeah yeah Andrew the only one that I 've got here additional to what 's been suggested already is recommendation 90 on page 96 and just some further explanation and discussion around the changes in red provides the limited growth and change to residential settlements in banks peninsula just to form a view on that with some some further information all right now in terms of this afternoon we have some issues around around timetable because this meeting was sheer George other meetings were scheduled at the same time so how many counselors do we lose it to 1230 well 30 okay so and there 's I 've got a meeting from 230 to 330 there are also some hours set aside for tomorrow for this if they 're needed yeah because tomorrow is your normal DPR committee time so at the normal time 92 yeah I know I know it 's a it is it is a really bad time your what can you what time can you do one o 'clock say and then I got I can do it from 1230 1230 yeah okay why don 't_''_1908.47 I join you for there I mean you 're here say what use on every if we can get the if we can get the peps of if I could ask you to just put forward the clicks on this document the list of all of the ones that are just the minor ones that you know because i want to remind people that this process is is part way down a track and there are very limited things that we can do at the stage so all we are doing are receiving the minister 's comments and we can only make changes that are in line with those comments if we make changes yes so we don 't have the ability to open up to other issues or be expensive around you know the broader issues around the DPR that 's what we 're obliged to do so that 's the process that we 're going to go through so okay well let 's let 's come back here at 12th it if you could get the list of all of the ones that are literally agree with the minister 's proposed that you can 't see any fish hawksworth if you could just identify those I think we could vote on them on block and then we could go through the other remaining issues five that we 've got got four big ones anyway there are a lot Jana do you want me to just give you the numbers or well if we if we 're going to do a page by page right well we could do it page by page will do it page by page but if you could have that ready so that you can identify we 're there is an issue and will par putt so that will at the end of the the first hour basically we will have the list of all of the issues that we 're going to debate okay yeah and I 'll be back here by yeah two yeah yep or earlier so it 's all coming back here at twelve-thirty or shall we or a bit later one at all oh it 1230 okay okay _"

    "text": "and then we have a motion in relation to the minister 's comments but I think we wanted to start first to hear from Richard about some items that you want to draw to our attention at the outset that right here script met Amir there is no ministers comment directly in relation to the specific purpose littleton port zone but the Rue comments made in the covering later by the minister on this matter a memo from richard osborne in DB Hogan was included an attachment 3 to the report which explained this matter so perhaps we could do that first before we actually get into the minister 's comments table all right so yeah would you want to speak to the to the memo so it 's on page 269 of your agenda yes I screwed utopia so through you madam chair and is the counselors will be aware last year the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery directed that a recovery plan be prepared for little comport and that has been going through processes of recent times basically LPC did a lot of work provided that tui can recently put it out for consultation what that includes is are basically the direction for littleton port looking forward quite some time into the future and it also includes draft changes to a raft of statutory documents including the RPS they stood the coastal plan as well as other regional documents but I 've note to the counselors it also includes draft amendments to the land-use provisions as well now as the council 's would be aware one of the chapters that we what up to the ministers for comment was the draft special purpose built in Porton so what we 've been doing over the the previous few months is working closely with a keen on what those provisions would look like and it originally been our intent that we would notify those through the replacement district plan process however he can have pursued notified those for consultation through the liver from Port recovery plan process and the memo before you really outlines I guess the pros and cons of which process you 'd choose and our recommendation to the counselors is that those land use on balance those port recovery plan process as opposed to the duplication that would occur if we were to also proceed with notification of those through the placement district plan process so the the memo which is contained within the report to you on page to it it considers a couple of options option a which is proceed with notification of the special purpose look importance own and option B as as the opposite of that not proceed with notification of that special purpose built in port zone and essentially our conclusion is that in our recommendation to you is that option B is the best option and there 's a raft of reasons for that not the least being the duplication of process the confusion that it may cause to the Lutheran community having to submit on two different sets of what else what are ostensibly the same set of provisions and the cost associated with pursuing those through different processes my guest at the end of the day to put it bluntly the the recovery plan his presence over the replacement district plans so regardless of what happened if we would replacement district plan at the end of the day the minister will sign off a recovery plan and that will be final and though there is some difference in two the provisions the recovery plan in essence Trump 's replacement district plan so our recommendation to you is that you proceed with option B and that is that we not proceed with notification of the land use provisions and for the reasons outlined in the memo its recommendation 6.6 in front of us would it be helpful if we just moved it as a separate resolution now and address that first up so I 'll move I 'll move 6.6 and Paul lonsdale war second words all right we 'll have questions and comments in a minute I just want to I just want to get there yep and we 're noting and that that submissions may be required to be made and they would be approved through a dpr subcommittee meeting yeah all right so questions it 's yani um can you just clarify for me where the current council resolution is that because I thought we 'd already to the the subcommittee of council recently and essentially that decision was to either to write to the minister and seek that he direct us to not proceed with notification through the replacement district plan or two and in the end the committee resolved to not write to the minister so but regardless of that we received comic back from the minister so we didn 't end up right into the minister seeking that direction from him but we got that direction regardless and the covering letter back to us it 's not a direction it 's as suggestions process you know so that they 're actually the minister 's aren 't in fact erecting us in this matter but they 've recommended a way forward which is a practical solution to the situation that we run with the dual process potentially in place and we would stop a dual process from occurring by accepting the staff recommendation today so recollection as we 've had this debate we 've made a decision I think we probably did that in a briefing rather than a formal committee what may have been make the decision I 'm not sure that 's right so do we have minutes of that meeting that I can reserve and see what we 've actually decided because clearly the hearing and and other Christmas the DPR subcommittee is not making decisions on they have not made a decision about not notifying I thought they didn 't write to the minister as i understand it we 've just heard advice on that meta- seeing richard can creat me from wrong is that following that DPR subcommittee meeting there 's been a note from the minister in relation to this which Richard refers to which okay may not direct us but an effect invites us to to have the little report plane and it in effect Trump Trump because it does something I 'm just trying to clarify as there was decisions that were made so if you look at some rumor that you 've got off and you look at the benefit option I an option B there 's a whole bunch of other information about who 's the decision maker what the scope of the little import up with our recommendation were resolution so I was just trying to understand what formally we 've already agreed to as a council because this seems quite different advice and what we then what we previously have had and what the intentions three well can we get an answer to that question what was the previous decision well was there a decision taken by the district land review subcommittee that is binding on us now the gluten working group agreed that having a single process there 's going to be far more preferable because FN that was a different decision at the end of it yeah yeah Maris 's everyone that 's the debate and what the previous decision of the subcommittee was to either write to the minister or not right to the minister we decided to the council decided to not write to the Minister requesting to get direction from them however regardless we got a suggestion which we 've outlined in the covering report to the counselors now the decision of council today as whether to proceed with notification of the land use provisions through the replacement 's parisians yeah this was always going to be a public discussion so the decision wasn 't previously taken in terms of what would what would be done this was I think the decision was taken that the measure was not going to be included in the and the letter to The ministers right when we referred the chapters ostensibly on the basis that it would be a matter that we would decide ourselves I presume that that 's what happen because I wasn 't actually at the meeting concerned and and now that decision has come to us appropriately at the right time and the in the process and what we 're being asked to do is to make the decision as to whether we notify or don 't notify and I 'm very much in favor of not notifying fell well if we could either debate now a city look I 'd support that I think that there 's more information for us now right in front of us now than when the committee last met also like we do have this letter from the minister as well are outlined in terms of option B would far outweigh the the advantages for example an option a yeah pawling as I recall last time the question one of the questions was should it be our decision to to allocate this to the London Kaveri plan for weekend or not and I think that was the book concern that it should actually not be us that do that and that we were going to request a direction from from the ministers of the question as whether this suggestion is strong enough for us to follow and the second was a concern that Andrew Turner spoke at length on this that the people the local people over there may not have enough input by way of the e km plan as opposed to our district plane that was a big concern that he spoke of so it 's a question for us of whether we 've believed that this suggestion from the minister is strong enough for us to pick up and say alright we will make this decision because it does become our decision which is what we didn 't may feel and who 'd I decided I think if I may madam chair you that the the preliminary draft will comport recovery plans currently open for submissions that is going to a hearing just been handed dates it was submissions open on 13 of April they closed the limit of Maine hearing begins on the second of june as cheered by panel so great Pankhurst is the chair of that panel so it 's a pretty form of a better description grantee grantee panel and you know there will be due consideration and that one of the things that we 're progressing at the moment and you know possibility of a council submission on that and we 've got a briefing to you next Monday and there 's been a memo go around to the Lord import working party on it and the direction that he can are seeking is that we don 't just submit but we actually provide our evidence to them as part of that submission as well so you know it will be a pretty formal process we will have an opportunity to be here perspective our recommendation is that we take that opportunity and put our best foot forward as part of those that here in process and that 's the appropriate form for us to do that if we were to proceed simply through notification of these land-use provisions to our own plan at would simply you know in terms of all those cons that we 've got and the memo to you you know there we do dual processors there would be potential confusion there will be double up on staff time there would be additional costs and at the end of the day you know that the law comport recovery plan will make that will be the decisive factor yep so sorry you need to bait about that yeah I personally won 't support this I feel really uncomfortable that the counselor who 's represents that Ward was involved in the previous decision unfortunately is not here at the moment is it a housing thing I 'd really like to hear from home because my recollection was we 've had this debate had this discussion we wait up the different options to go through notifying as part of our district plan because it 's actually a more transparent decision-making process than a recovery plan it actually takes it away from the minister making the final decision and puts it to that independent hearings panel and we actually thought that there was equally as much confusion as going through only one process for a recovery plan then actually going through the two different processes that is because the port recovery plan is limited to port recovery and the district plan is around wider land use and luncheon so it seems to me we 're actually talking about two different phones and pulling them into one process that 's a recovery plan when in fact some of the potential is a lot more than just a recovery plan that 's really talking about fundamentally changing the land use pattern in littleton i think is something that should be going through the district plan review so i don 't know whether it 's possible to leave this item on the table until we hear from the local councillor i know the local community board i 'm not prepared to support this i don 't actually think it 's the right way to go I know the minister has of you I think we actually this is our district plan and we need to stand firm clear yeah so kelsey tuners just arrived so he can speak for work i had discussed with him Glen thank you for me what 's important is the context that are laid behind that decision of that subcommittee or that recommendation to not write to the minister and that was what and that was simply that we supported that principle of notification the way this process now is I kind of stepped up it suggests it will take us down an efficient path by way of a dual process but in principle I still support that most basic principle here of notifications I 'm councillor johansson Andrea um yeah I when we 've previously discussed this had been in favor of us continuing to pursue this chapter ourselves and continue to develop in the way that we 'd originally intended clearly there are some efficiencies and practicalities to allowing in place of our chapter I was always keen that if there was a suggestion that that was the way should be done it should come through the port recovery plan process rather than council requesting that we change our process and we 're now in a different space than we were at the time that we had that conversation so for all it 's a difference to the view that I put forward previously I 'm now supportive of the staff recommendation thinking yeah well I 'd like to agree with Andrew I think that I wasn 't_''_1000.459 at the earlier discussion but we 've had a fairly clear statement from two ministers I think our counselors can feel comfortable with the with the advice that they 've given even though they weren 't asked to provide it they have said it would help be helpful to avoid duplication I 've got every confidence and sir Graham Pankhurst operating a process and instead of inviting people to speak to sir Graham bankers committee and then to speak to the John Henson 's committee I think it 's actually better little tongue recovery planning process it 's it 's it 's not an ideal situation but the truth is is that you know littleton littleton port is more than the port that is the it is the land around it and the communities engage with it so and I 've got enormous confidence and and and the committee that Andrew is leading in that regard for us as a council so I 'm very supportive of the staff recommendation so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so who 's voting node you can you just put up your hand yani Pauline and Glen the minutes are here but they 've been being confirmed because we haven 't had another DP our meeting since their meeting yep well years ago yeah all right so so that one 's now dealt what that scary _"

    "text": "item 13 the visitor strategy review is this you mike welcome back we 're in your heads you want to talk yes thank you and just to confirm so on the screen you have the correct city staff recommendations that for some reason an older trim version got got logged into the actual document so you 'll see that and that the fundamental differences that we intend to come back at least before the end of July 2015 with a draft strategy and a timetable for its completion so that that 's a quicker time frame than we had in the earlier draft so a number of councillors would have been involved and were part of a discussion from the airport company who did a bit of a analysis and Gavin 's got that here and you 've got that their destination 2012 20 20 25 document which looked at a basically an opportunity to see what 's or some of the risks and opportunities worth with the role of the visitor and tourism industry in Christchurch and started to explore some of the bigger pictures around the role of of the city so that 's a piece of work that had been agreed some months ago for CI al to lead they volunteered to do that and really what that has come back and say actually there 's a very great opportunity to relook at how we deliver visitors that visitor strategy how we deliver the role of the visitor and tourism and that sort of activity into the life of the city 's recovery this is really saying we empower staff the chief executive to go away and to work with those strategic partners particularly CDC and cct and others to look at how we might deliver a modern robust visitor strategy and in person that is how we might structure the delivery of that strategy as well so really this is a very hopefully a simple step to say yes let 's go away and do that let 's start their analysis and let 's look at the time frame we 've got their concept of including innovation as a magnet to the city and all sorts of things like the talent these are in things so and I don 't need to make any I don 't think we need to make any specific resolutions about that yet we can certainly make sure all those elements of the year cool android um yeah pleased to receive the document today acknowledge the work done by Malcolm and his team in getting it to this point I think as a discussion document this is excellent I think it 's important that we we don 't make any assumptions around what this might look like until the further pieces of work have been done it 's important that function comes before form that action come before delivery methods that we work out the what before we work out the who and that the debate on what actions are required and who 's best placed to deliver them a best had at the time the further work has been done so in the knowledge of that further report referred to in 6.2 it 's clear to say and and Mike you 've certainly addressed this there have been significant changes to the visitor market since the earthquakes and significant work economy in all its senses and facets at the same time as we recover the sitting the only other point i would make and this is from a banks peninsula point of view a corolla gets two mentions in the document and i would certainly like to see the further work done to have a balanced focus not only on the central city and the city areas but also on the peninsula and a corolla as obviously part of our visitor offering particularly in the tourist sense but now I welcome the document I welcome to further work been able to be done in the relatively short time frames that we 're looking at and certainly we were very happy to support this today thank you for this granted it 's a discussion document and so it invites conversation around it I still have some big questions over whether it is really transformational anxiety think that that 's the mode into which we need to shift as a city I 'm not sure that it really takes us into a paradigmatic shift as a city it seems to be obsessed approach and I know that when you look at the the gradual shift to the primary destination marketing over time such as convention sales tourism marketing services that that is the status quo that 's what is done but is it actually seeking to take advantage of what the city actually is I can 't find any reference at all to our coastal communities they seem to be ignored and I can 't really see any reference to arguably the city 's greatest asset which is the whole of the Avon or tackle river corridor not just the avon river precinct so I think it is it 's short at this point but it is a discussion document at that that 's the intention of this today for us to send it out for community conversation but i do want an inclusion and a transformational dimension to it my personal view is that when the east of christchurch recovers the city does too but more more than that much more than that when that East is transformed the city is transformed to so I I think it 's got to 't know whether you want to incorporate to enable an overarching transformational visitor strategy or whether you just want that to come out in the process no I think we might I think what we want to do is to have a real visitor G such that we haven 't got convention delegates sidelined over here other visitors sidelined over here students sidelined over here international groups sidelined over here so that they 're actually all dealt with as visitors and welcome to not just the city but the visitors strategy actually deals with Christ Church as the center of the South Island not just the coastal communities of Christchurch not just a career but actually the entire South Island and a few yeah and if you read through this what you discover is that people coming in to Christchurch have a huge impact on the whole rest of the South Island if they go into Queenstown they don 't so this is where people come for the whole of the South Island 's assets and if you start thinking about what are not just the assets of the city happen to be in the center of and the point where people come into it 's a stunning opportunity and I think what they 've done here is absolutely Brent like looking at where the future of tourism is where it 's likely to come from what they come for and what makes a difference and we 're where they come into and the impact that that has so I think the work that the airport group have done has actually been one of the best pieces of work I 've seen on our tourism strategy and Christchurch for a very long time I think excellent Paul I 'd like to fully endorse what you just said there at he but also but I also want to recognize what Glenn has said and and just to give some maturity to Glenn this this continuation of this work will be in conjunction obviously with CDC CDC are actually currently looking at doing special pieces of work around places like New Brighton places like a Corral places like Littleton which as you will well actually connect them to these air and it as you say will improve it for the whole of the city because yeah I do agree that natural assets are far wider than the stuff that 's quite local but they are equally as important and I think in many respects asses Christchurch residents we undervalue our own natural assets we seem to have turned our back on them over the many years and we 're now actually taking cognizant of what we 've been doing and we 're building towards our rivers where if you look into a bitter our rivers take an opportunity to the red zone and obviously the red zone provides a great opportunity for su New Brighton so I support you say but i think this work will be encapsulated in this outstanding piece of initial discussion work that 's taking place so mama right behind this living as greatest work and we have a South Island I think so the most outstanding natural assets not only in New Zealand but in the world and I think the rest of the rule are seeing New Zealand for what it is it 's a safe an outstanding landscape right across so I think we just need to make sure we capture it and actually make sure we actually market it to that level um yeah I to just want to share in some of the concerns but what I 'm understanding we 've been after d-day set up a price is where we can have actually more direct input but if you look at pages like 3 14 of our report or 48 it talks about you know how important mega events are light the cricket world cup or if you turn the page 49 it says that we need to bring forward the stadium so you know I I I think it 's actually there 's things in here that do kind of you know buy into that you your kind of over hypo of these major events now we 're going to go through a debrief around the cricket world cup for example just to see what actual benefits these events accrue we often spend a huge amount of money on the height and when we actually look at what we get in is where we might spend that money on other things like at coastal area or a recreation facilities so you know I think we do have to kind of look at this as someone else has done this we 're now sitting up a process where we can feed in and put in the directions where we want to go because I certainly have some consume and over some of the things in here but I do think we need to have a comprehensive visitor strategy and I think it does need to look at those wider issues that have been raised so on that basis i 'm happy to support it even i don 't agree with some of its thinking that the one thing that we can 't forget is this is the start with the regards to a visitor strategy and discussion document we 've talked offline with over this when we 've looked at it with regards to what makes Canterbury in christchurch what gives us its flavor what gives its value over other cities etc and to assist people coming to the entire South Island and we 've talked about this better our community events the flavor that gives our streets that buskers kid buskers kids until no small things we in visitors come here give us an edge over and above other other centers and how we align this with our event strategy which obviously is coming to the it was 26 26 20 16 so that 's got to be redone as well so there are some links and what we 've got to do in the future this is a discussion document I think it 's actually a really good piece of work we want to get people 's opinion on stadium a major events and other things as Jonnie said that we are going to do a debrief with regards to cricket world cup look at that success of Tim entertaining we really want to work on that gives the flavor of New Zealand so if we can get more tourists here to give it that real Kiwis flavor so I think it 's a fantastic piece of work it 's a first step and I think it 's a great you Carrie ok so I 'm we 've now done item _"

    "text": "but I 'm just yeah so do you guys have any concerns about the car parking where you think that there will be private can I bugs well i think that the that sector of the city needs a holistic approach to car parking it 's not just an approach to the central library it 's not just an approach the convention center for the performing arts precinct or even ask where it needs it needs a considered approach to the provision of a large number of car parks to service those those entities and I think that 's probably the best approach so rather than taking a piecemeal approach which would be to say let 's build a basement at vast expense to accommodate 40 cars it 's actually look at a an integrated car parking solution for that area and to add to peters points it 's also a daytime activity and a nighttime activity obviously the Performing Arts will be more of a nighttime activity the lab will be a mixture of the two of just just around the car parking did the previous might we have a car parking building and joining it and was a separate building was a lot yes it was and in that was only built Natalie when when the building opened it had no capital and has second questioners going for a whole new design phase of a building will that impact the budget know what the approach now is to say to market here 's his out here 's our budget here 's his what we consider important in library building now now you guys come come to us with your best ideas to deliver on the budget and the quality and the D attributes that we 've outlined thank you funding in that I 'm the funding of the project particularly the 10 million dollars of philanthropic funding good okay yeah I think what we would expect to come back at that time would be you know a further report that talked about the philanthropic funding whether it had been achieved or whether it hadn 't what work had been done and I mean I guess we need a basis for why council would be expected to underwrite that that reporting I don 't think we need to detail it today but we will have that debate at that time I would say okay so I think Chris it sees particularly the ten-million-dollar philanthropic hour what have you got the earth is fine okay jaani did one speaker a question the questioner and the financial oh so like I 'm going to start with 6.1 to prove indecent up to 85 million when we I don 't think we can legally do that because that 's the proven 10 million dollars that we haven 't consulted on that we don 't currently have on budget so I 'm just trying to find a better resolution than what we 've got that recognizes that we can only I believe today legally approve 75 million that we 've currently got on budget and then some other process happens around that each episode we 're going up for an expression of interest based on an 85 million dollar complete belt as I understand it and then if we don 't by any chance get all of the 10 million or we only our cloth accordingly at the time I say that but 6.1 doesn 't say that so I just comment on that the ten billion dollars yeah the 10 million dollars is in the cost sharing agreements so it is in the public domain and it is in the budget it 's just it 's just not funded at the moment in terms of its not on the council budget for this financial year so how much money is on the council budget for this financial year building this shining well as an 85 million dollar concept worst case we don 't fit out all of the building because what you 've said earlier was that the 10 million dollars could be used at the end of this project so we get the library and I think what people want to do is get the library as fast as possible and then worst case it may be that the top floor doesn 't get fitted out for a couple of years as I read it but I may be completely wrong you will come back with a whole range of things before we make an investment decision with the temple we will come back and we will give counsel some solutions if that 10 million dollars not so would you put like that and let me just check with in would would that be better approve the potential investment of up to 85 million or okay can we find a different wording for that yes okay cool are there any other questions the meantime no i mean the the best representation of what 's just been said in my world would be that we should be approving 75 million with an acknowledgement that if the ten-million-dollar philanthropic funding is not found then that 's a debate that we need to have at that time i would hate to be sending a signal the 10 million is in any way optional and that we 're going to underwrite that and I think by putting 85 million in there that 's exactly the message we are sending so I 'd like to see that 75 in 6.1 reduced 85 in 6.1 reduced to 75 with an acknowledgement that we may need to have 's not forthcoming with well we 've had some conversations with some community funders and some and so that we do believe don 't get me wrong there is a risk around 10 million going out for philanthropic funding around a library is actually new we 've done it for sports facilities which is you would it be aware of that and then basically but a library is a little bit of a new area but basically we have had a discussion and we are working with Sarah to work and they have given us a commitment to do it so when we came back with that report which you 've got up that bottom resolution we will talk to you about what is the potential what is the risk we will have done more work Sierra 's doing a report on it exactly at this point in time and I 'm not you know look I don 't know what the outcome of it because they 're doing that report I 've got some specialist things so when we come back in September we will be able to give raised that money on you know won 't say that because it will be a couple years to try and get the way but we will be able to give you some idea about what is that potential if we cut back and we say to a contractor where we 're going out for a 75 we will have to we will have to cut back that design so we 'll have to go back to the design and go out with a smaller point one that we instruct were you that we instruct stuff to do that and then we put at the bottom of that that council recognizes that the total investment to build the new Central Library of 9 8 50 square meters on the site designated is 85 million dollars but that the council recognizes that its contribution to that yep said okay we 're okay did so and so we 've got instruct that becomes 6.1 and then I think we just say just 6.2 disappears no no but the 6.2 numbers disappear and we just say council recognizes that the total investment to build yep yep that 's right I 've approximately nine hundred and eighty nine thousand whatever it is so you 've got most of it they 're actually Chris if you just cut out a few words to build the news around the site lisa matters is 85 million is up to 85 million but that the council recognize it but that the council about that the council 's contribution to this project is currently 75 million and that a report comes back to the council in September to provide updates on the funding the project including the philanthropic contribution okay we 've already got that in the budget so we 've already approved it yes is that okay sorry it 's going around and a we better circles everybody can I just get that clarified clean this is everyone okay with it yep total cost okay yep Ricky I was just checking with Dave and Ian and everyone if they 're okay with it yeah you 're living with it oh it 's disappeared utter you happy in would we know they were you okay yeah okay end and just that the total cost just changed investment to cost Chris yeah okay are we good clean thank you just in the tendering process Liam how can we ensure that the council 's questions and concerns over the costs are reflected and the waiting area attributes worse with that part of the tin ring because we know that cost isn 't always necessarily depending on the procurement model used isn 't necessarily the overriding factor but obviously it 's a critical one for the council 's how do we ensure that in do you think that 's necessarily changes anticipated procurement more so the fair stage is an expression of interest the market and the idea of the expression of interests get suitably qualified and experienced contractors design teams in a consortium to be able to tender so that 's the fair 's process we then go between three and five consortiums to go to a tender process that tender process will have a mix of attributes some price some quality some of r attributes but they will all be suitably qualified to undertake that project so we will signal to part of that marketing scheme will be part of the tender documentation and we will wake that through with our design team and qsr isn 't qualified stuff so if I so that the actual costing I know we don 't we don 't want it to necessarily override but it is an important part for the council that will be signaled quite strongly is it I think I think it 's been signaled close early today but there is an option in our tender documentation which we haven 't agreed yet so there 's an option to give the market the price that we believe that the building is and therefore any price as a book that wouldn 't be accepted so if you wants to go that way we could do book I think the project team should look at our fares before we decide that um as I mentioned earlier i am absolutely welcome the fact that this project has got to this point i think it 's some a great step in the future of the central city and in provision of good quality community facilities I 'm concerned as I noted about the escalation in cost from the 60 million in the cost share agreement the additional 15 million additional funding from the carpe diem or the betterment fund and then today the additional 10 million proposed in the in the original resolution so I welcome the fact that we 've made that change by way of amendment and my view of the 10 million is that it 's not appropriate for us to be approving that today I think this further information needs to come back and I welcome that report coming in September including what 's been done to secure the the 10 million philanthropic funding what might have been anticipated under the cost share agreement if that 10 million wasn 't forthcoming whether it would be expected that council would naturally underwrite that or whether there is a responsibility or an expectation the government would would carry some of the or all of the count of that underwrite and really just details on what engagement there has been by that stage with the philanthropic sector and government to to resolve this particular I 've focused in my questioning and the issues I 've raced today on the financial aspects of the project I don 't want that in any way to be seen anything other than a prudent response to the financial situation the city staring down the barrel of at the moment and I don 't want that to be seen in any way as negative I think this is a great project and I absolutely welcome it proceeding as quickly as possible and that 's one of the reasons that my initial questioning was whether changing the resolution in the way that we have wouldn 't cause any delays to the project I absolutely welcome the project going ahead and yeah certainly look forward to seeing this exciting anchor project built on the square and I look forward to seeing community members using what I 'm sure is going to be a great facility in a great anchor for the central setting thank you yeah look I 'm I 'm really excited to see this project going ahead and I just want all I want to say is that time here the sooner we 'll actually ever a wee bit I deliver this project within its budget so I uji ability to get behind this here support it and lets us get on with issue the rebuild our city thank you this is a really significant moment for us this is something we can do and we 're not we don 't necessarily have control over everything in the city and libraries is what this council I think does really well and we are known for this as a person with a keen interest and procurement for me this is a critical part in the whole cost dimension of it ensuring that if the if you get the capex right to then you get the objects right so obviously the whole thing is critical I build a bookcase the other day I 'm a baby boomer I 'm aware that our kids have a gin ye may not have bookcases and their homes and flats but what I see in this library is a harking back to our past air heritage but also an invitation to the future and I so I 'm very excited with this I think it 's a big day for us and uninvite us all to support it thank you um I 'm actually really excited by the designer I like our notes of concept but I think it 's really really cool i think but you know we 've seen a few collect boxes built but this is absolutely wonderful time i was really surprised about the connections with our Reiki etc why beyond my brain but you know Lyle I just would have built something different and it since being a dyslexic I 'm a very slow reader but I have a patient for books which I 'm very fortunate with so the fines i probably paid our library hate to think but the this is probably the single best investment we can make in our communities I am so fortunate in my family love and South Christchurch tree of the South library it as a real focus for our community has been through the amat that the dilemmas we 've been through but the central library is dead but on steroids and ebooks and things I love box I love opening them I love the smell and the feel of them and I spend a lot of time with them but random I don 't get too many of them now thanks to these things but I 'm not being no no actually no I 've always paid my fines I 'm not swimming pools we won 't go there but I just I want to think that library staff I think that I 'm you 're saying that you initially started looking at the library the center line about 2009 and in its future we 've been in you especially of being through so much and to come with us at the end I think it 's absolutely fantastic so my hat goes off to you guys thank you that 's caught me I support everything that 's been said originally I I did like the old site but that was turned out to be not an option around the river there however the benefits of this side is actually going to be lightening up the square at last in the the lights on I 'm hoping that this building will actually be a very green energy building that we can have lights on at night time I think that 's really important Vicky you 'll be supporting prep some creative lighting I 'd say yes sir oh yeah it 's going to be wonderful to see that I 'm live and up and congratulations for all the good work you 've done on it thank you Jesus yeah so you know I think when you look at the consultation that we did around the smart choices the single most important project that the public wanted prioritize was the new library so that came through really clear and you know it is something that I think the public must I am here to say really said at a huge cost that 's been imposed on us by government through the blueprint the public never really had a choice to decide which site the new library would go on whether we could retain the old one I used to make the cost of the blueprint on us as a council 's probably so that 's the that 's you know we 're having a big debate about our financial situation the impose costs from the blueprint of designating the site and taking our old site there 's probably if you just redevelop the old site or expanded it probably could have been done for about 20 to 30 million so total cost of this project probably getting up to about 130 with land and all the other issues so you know this is a cost imposed on us by government but I think we need to go ahead and build it because as a project that people want us to do but I do think we need to spend a lot of time thinking about car parking and access I know that you know in some of these diagrams it looks like there 's no cars going through cathedral square and it may be that we just get rid of traffic from Cathedral Square but we need to start thinking about how all these pieces are fitting together and how people get access because I think the worst thing we could do come in and if you think of library books been quite heavy this is quite a long way away from the bus interchange which is you know again a lost opportunity probably they have some synergy between the two hours thought it would have been a good idea but I 'm happy for us to get on and get this done given that where you 're really constrained by the blueprint and that is a project that people really want I just finally comment on the design you know I 'm not personally sold on this design but but I appreciate that many different people will have different views and that 's always the nature of anything that gets design and I am part and that if we do get quite a strong backlash to what 's being proposed that we do have time to look at and revisit some elements of it because I think it 's really important that the public do buy into what we 're building in the city and they do buy into these bigger civic projects that get built because they are will become I think the worst thing we could do is have had things that don 't don 't have a kind of general consensus accepting that not everyone will agree but you know we have seen a lot of I go up and down Barbados street with no even designed controls and look at some of the buildings that are getting built there and it really breaks my heart not saying that this fits that category but I just think we always need to be thinking about the future heritage and landmarks that we 're creating and what the long-term impact is so thank you to the staff for the work they 're doing hopefully we can get on with this 10 million I mean I dunno two years and zero have you know what 's been happening for two years around that 10 million that 's certainly a long time and I 'm really disappointed that nothing 's been done in that regard as we know though sometimes you need to get the design first and makes it easier so let 's hope that they can come through we get I think it 's really exciting I 'd like to thank you guys as well I know we 've put you through a lot and you 've come out the other end incredibly well and so we will need somebody to move it and we would like to move it and Tim would like to see conduct Oh put that those in favor please say aye how 's post carried unanimously thank you guys _"

    "text": "to Dudley Creek flood remediation update Colleen you 've got some changes that you want to make I just like to take out 8.3 my proposal was actually to talk to Sarah my equivalent overview and I think that we could deal with it that way if not come back to council that so my proposal to take out 8.3 simply I think with it we can have a discussion with Sarah around us and should that not be successful then come back to Council but I 'm pretty sure we can work it out ourselves if I may are you suggesting that it 's an informal and formally request rather than formerly as officials will hit that what will work through officials through the red zone with officials in various ways that we can implement not only this little piece of work when we decide exactly what this piece of work and involve but other bits and pieces it 's just if we go through that they 're actually formally locks in a solution and it may not be the easiest and the right solution so what we 're they recognize both of them and so we will have to resolve it by the time we come back with a final solution but we will we 're working on a variety of different solutions so is it it 's correct i think in the report it says that the the funding required for beaker is within container than the original 48 million for the cost of this option what you 've funded in the LTP is a series of Investigation Lee works and also physical works and so it 's within your LTP or within the budgets that we 've got already and some of that will be carried forward into the final and then we 've got both investigations and physical works in the next three years for the drainage program as we go into final design in the discussions with sarah about the section 53 would apply to both options either options slightly different day different and so the solutions might be different in the different places and but we still need the we need their approval to put any infrastructure into the into the red zone or the other one my understanding is that because the bank 's option does take widening of the creek potentially an hour look we 'll come back with a detailed report one option might be a little bit easier than another option but we 'll come back as part of the pros and the cons of the various options when this works been completed in the suit just one is there any chance that it could be completed earlier than July we my understanding from our consultants azhar working pretty hard to try and we 've got our foot omnia driving them very fast to get there so now I would say but I don 't actually think that there 's a bit of work to be done around red zone as well so I would not raise your expectations it 'll come back any earlier and we still have to go through the consultation process so we have to have both options worked up to a very high level so that we can consult formally and that 's required to meet any requirements of Sarah will have that we option so to redo this yes so this so the the agreement at the December meeting was that would be further engagement and in consultation on both options with the community including Bank serving the residents so we will go through a short formal period of consultation to allow that process to to complete and that 's part of the process that would be required to me the sarah requirements as well yeah nice re the resolution should say Richard Speck to be a pro and I 'm just it just seems like a huge amount of money what what confidence can we have I mean why is it costing so much just get consultants to do do this work is it is it just the time involved as it expertise would it just seems extraordinary are going to have to do a reasonable detailed design on two options obviously but when you think design costs of ten percent are not unusual it 's actually within the ballpark of the work that has been specified it has been out for competitive tender and there were here multiple one he lives up because at the December meeting it was approval given to delegate authority toward the consultancy contract the reason I bring it back is to to tidy up because we 've extended the scope of that slightly to include construction supervision so this this gives us certainty of all the the free element within the design consultancy services including construction supervision and do we not have the existing capability within our own organization so in cash do we not have the existing capability within our own organization I just wonder whether if we spent five million on having the appropriate technical staff within our own organization whether that 's better value but have we been to that that exercise within my area we haven 't told up to be we principally doing we 've got project managers who are managing the various programs and projects principally most of the works because it 's a short intensive is out sourced there are some consultants that we 've employed almost full-time but we 've also got some good rates on there there are a couple that we think if we 're going to three is we are actually either employing them or we are doing so we 're looking at the balance what 's the most cost effective for how much of that work and how much is has specialized expertise required saying it might sort of follows along a sort of line so you know just looking at the huge amount of consultancy costs and actually the overall project costs of 48 million proposed and does will this work be holistic enough to take into account that if there is a massive rainfall that the down part of a catchment doesn 't become flooded from the woods we do up the catchments so I just don 't want to see us go down the track you know investing all this money and we flood somewhere else and I suppose and some of that says you I don 't know will this work and compass that yes obviously the you know that 's a you 're voicing a concern that the public may reasonably have so that 's why we 're employing specialist consultants with the modeling work has been done to that will meet those objectives just as following on from that and I suppose the removal of the the the 8.3 is around the the future of that red zone part which we know we 're going to have to obviously put some stock banks and somewhere to help mitigate issues with flooding and not knowing what we can actually do in there and the work we 're going to be doing artisan make sure there is a shi 'ite_''_462.33 joined up process with three of the whole thing I suppose it 's written a nub of the question what we 've done is we 've given Sarah a indicative run of where we are wanting to put our stop banks in our infrastructure in the red zone and that will be formed part of the consultation that they 'll go out of the community and it will be all integrated approach I think if you 're in the last time we brought it up I think there was a discussion about there 's some works that weren 't going to be affected by the bottom end of the works with those and John Mackey at the time said well if you proceeded with those it 's actually going to flood make the flooding issue in that same catch from fear that so that 's why we haven 't done quite a work just to for exactly that saying that the reason that you 've raised yeah tation quickly if we fast-tracked the heat and say let 's say option 2 was deemed to be appropriate the one going through the red zone would that mean that the we would basically be redirecting the Dudley and the banks everyone would be dry or would we just use that reads own one in a flood that 's the second option so the the bypass would be would be dry the majority of the time other than for testing it would just be in a storm event that that would become a secondary right all the spill it 's good and we also have an option of whether it would be piped or open yes so the case so with what we have been doing is we 've been having some very this stage that a piped option or a tunnel micro tunneled option would be strongly favored to an open channel option and so that that you know is something that we 've been talking to them about it and they also a wee that it would probably be dry most of the time it got an open ones actually said operationally better for us in in some respects an open channel obviously takes takes up more land space it 's more disruptive to the landed it passes through the marine ecology of still to decide the church is still to decide what to what to do with that site and so they want to keep their options open similarly with the the park an open channel would be more disruptive to the facilities on the site the curricula et cetera or start to impact upon trees more so it 's a bit of a balance so one of the things that the consultants are doing are you know investigating those options and more detail to ensure that you know we have a workable a proposal to put back to you December meeting following on the arborist report of the bank seven you area which would indicate the decimation of half of the trees in that area was that the staff were going to go away to look for other options we 're now presented with this report which indicates look here 's an option over going through red zone man but what comes through in this report today is an interpretation that which I see that is actually non-committal it doesn 't actually indicate that it 's a future solution for banks if it looks like it 's it could be one way or the other is that that was no instructed us you we we gave you four options and there was a variation on the four options and we took option one which was the original one an option two which takes you down the back and there 's a slightly different costs and those are the two options that you asked us to go and those are the two that the consultants designing up and we 're going the issue with the second option was we hadn been other submissions so you 've asked us to look the two of them and then go compare but also to identify the trees that are affected and I think while there are trees are figure you 've got to recognize that when we do any project we also real and scape and part of that real landscape would be replanting of trees and so it 's actually looking up those two options and what are the two options looks what are the pros and the cons both from an effectiveness point of view from a cost point of view so that 's really what this work is going to do but we 've eliminated me here I think there were another two options or maybe another three options they 've got eliminated at that last meeting so we 're only really comparing two options okay like if this just wanted to reinforce the collective voice of the four ward councillors representing that combined areas quite strong that this would decimate that area so I just wanted to run for yes one of the things that we we are looking put forward were apples with apples that they both worked up to the same level of detail there was some criticism last time that that the alternative bypass was was was not worked at that detail and banks Alvin you needed further work to lift the detail on that too so what we 'll have is we 'll have two options worked up to an equal level that we can have a fair comparison on and again that 's um thing which sara have indicated is going to be really important in determining the consent because it 's important that the right decision is made on the best option it will be an almost push back if we go through banks here in other work so should not dissipate an area basically we would go through and we would reinsert but we 've got a lot of the comparisons of the two and we 've got a look at the cost and you 've gotta love the effectiveness of them and that 's what we are going to bring back to you in July the win those in July when new one are you coming up with an option that optimizes the minimum number of tree removals and the proposals that would allow for trees to remain and water to flow around them and in an extreme flood I mean it 's all very well saying that we can landscape and replant but some of those trees of 40 50 more years old you can 't replace a an established tree you know replanting and one of the biggest concerns with the banks have root was was going to be the potential decimation of huge numbers of established trees now I 've want to grow through that catchment and to my mind a lot of them could actually stay in the waterway and and an extreme flood can easily play around them they don 't get anywhere the current water level doesn 't get anywhere near them but an extreme one may do but to chop them out because you want to actually physically make a huge great waterway and then lend ugly waterway whereas a naturalized answer trying to leave as many trees there as possible waterways there 's but if you 're going to come up with a proposal that actually wants to widen the waterway rip out 300 trees and replace them with young specimens which is going to take 30 40 50 years to get back to where they are now it 's not something that 's going to be very palatable at all and we recognize that and you made that very clear at the last meeting and that 's why we 're looking at the two options and going to consult on them come back and that 's been clearly communicated to our consultants and so those are the options but we didn 't remember we didn 't have a plan of which trees were coming out which weren 't we had a young and so that 's some of the detail that we will do it at that design stage and so we can compare apples with apples yeah pose to carry thank you very much guys um guys I 'm assuming since we 've got about five cause asleep that we might just carry on yeah go to _"

    "text": "great I 've forgotten optical as well item 11 okay I assume they live in this the report of the hearings panel which we would normally think would be a simple issue but what did we decide Dave if I can just sort of expect to it briefly you 'll be aware that the parks and reserves by law was brought to Council earlier this year and was sent back to the hearings panel to address three areas in a little more detail two of the areas concerned wording around a parking issue where the word ordinarily was used that Clause has been rewritten as in on page 221 sub section 4.1 it 's rewritten they 're quite clearly without the word ordinarily that covers that I show off the issue of drones the hearings panel we really consider that the submitter that book forward use to the to the panel that the drones fitted comfortably within the descriptive of other devices that capable and we actually just recommended that a note be added to the bylaw that the reading that the general intent of this clause was to address and rules are covered by separate legislation so those two items I believe we 've we 've covered off on the third item that the Bible panel was charged with looking at considered the proposal to insert a clause regarding the scattering of ashes in the original hearing we had four submitters to of those came back again in the second hearing we had MKT and Adrian Tea Party on behalf of the Littleton Mount Herbert community board I just like to practice make it make a general comment that really vitals are my view are created in response to issues in the community or a need to regulate a particular activity destroy your attention to comments that were made in the deliberations MKT acknowledged that it 's not practicable to prevent people from scattering ashes and public places the Littleton Mount Herbert community board reiterated the board 's position that they didn 't want to prevent people scattering ashes but it 's also quite pertinent to note that MKT were quite keen on encouraging the education of the public as to the cultural impact this activity has on Mary preferred the restriction of scattering of ashes and burial of placenta to designated areas or you Rupert so we have that that issue to deal with I believe a bylaw has to be enforceable and in my opinion it 's unlikely that any x log will prevent people with a desire to scatter ashes of the loved one in a particular area that has significance to that family or the deceased enforceability is a quite an issue for our our staff they are quite stretched with monitoring and enforcing various bylaws and particularly resource consent conditions so for me to sort of have a listen to me personally to have a a clause in the bylaw that specifically prevents they 're scattering ashes was quite difficult and I sat on the panel with a member of community board and Glenn Livingstone it was a split decision and we recommend it in the end that we would recommend that this vile or come back to the council and we omit the scattering of ashes portions from the vial or at the moment and then go back out to the community if on the issue of scattering of ashes to come to an acceptable position with our partners MKT and members of the community and I think it 's quite quite strongly noted in the submissions that we did receive that MKT really were seeking to educate the public into the the cultural impact that this activity may have on Miriam why tapu and the same sort of thing came out from the Littleton Mount Herbert community board so I 'm happy to recommend the hearings panel I saw removed the recommendations from the hearings panel and particularly that we we go back to our community and open a wider consultation on the acceptability of scattering of ashes and whether it should be a general prohibition or we come up with some other resolution to deal with the issue um so I 'd probably like Joe I 'm not sure what process is here perhaps foreshadowing amendment well my amendment would be quite the converse of what 's proposed so whether it can be moved as amendments or not I don 't know and I can explain my reasons why but and recommendation of the hearings panel today and that we refer this matter to the full council for a decision I 'm first for shattering for the motion big toe it 'll work um yes certainly and the reason I can 't support the motion as its put today is that I 'm not happy for this bylaw to be approved with this matter of clearly some significant cultural consideration and also clearly there are differing views that haven 't fully been heard as yet I 'm not happy to approve this bylaw with this significant matter still unresolved I think it needs to be resolved before we can we can approve the bylaw to approve the bylaw and then signal that we 're going to possibly look at changing that very soon after it 's been approved would seem to be quite absurd I think we need to do the work once and do it well before we do the approval so the issue for me really is that there are cultural considerations around this which obviously the hearings panel has heard in the first round of submissions and then and the the two further submissions or the two repeats submissions that were heard clearly both suggested that this issue of scattering of ashes is something of cultural importance and cultural significance and I think clearly one of the aspects that we need to look at here is the need for education around the cultural effects of this particular activity so yeah clearly there 's further work that needs to be done I note that there was a difference of opinion on the hearings panel around this it certainly wasn 't an unanimous if we were to simply refer the matter back to the hearings panel it 's some highly likely that you know the hearings panel have already formed a view on this which may then result in the same response again I think it 's better if this comes back to the full council so that awareness of the issue can be raised so that we get a chance to debate it properly and then approve the bylaw wants everything that 's been considered and has been decided rather than approving it now and then coming back to issue so yeah I 'll be opposing the the resolution but certainly signal the the need to deal with this differently by way of that further resolution that i signaled is thank you and I 'll be along similar lines to councillor tuna just to speak to my own arrogance for a minute if the panel had listened to me we wouldn 't have been in this shutting peds and forwards with this because MKT is our partner there are local expression of our treaty partner and you can see in 7.2 up there that just not not just another stakeholder and I think that that 's a fundamental part that sits behind this whole by law here yum Cranwell it was actually quite real about the whole thing and he unreasonable and he was simply saying that they need you know he was asked that we here MKT so I do support what andrew is saying and I think we need to go back but pity we 've had to do this shuttling really that 's will seed that I was going to say but I think it 's they have we need to be really sensitive to the cultural impact here of what they 've pointed out in their submission so I fully support this coming back to to the council to to be discussed and to work with in katy more thoroughly and gain a better understanding of where they 're coming from and what they want so I 'll be supporting the foreshadowed amendment I just want to talk on support of faith and his panel and they 've gone through the submission process I 've heard the things they 've actually identified the fact that they will engage with MKT and other interested parties to find the acceptable resolution so I 'm sort of confused at we go down a different track because I thought 7.2 actually highlights there is going to be further engagement on that particular issue can I just sorry I 've expressed a consistent gear all along now you know you yeah I did and you didn 't take your advice that 's right that 's the Democratic call on a completely different matter which you 're with me too um people parking on Kremlin square legally so because when I lodge complaints around the widespread use of creaminess square for car parking I was advice that we ever get in our bylaws that currently allow people to be able to do it and I just don 't think it 's appropriate we 're taking a lot of trees from these sorts of places because of damage the I don 't know if it 's directly related to the car parking but it would be sensible to assume that it does have an impact and I personally think we we need for urgency i 'll read through it it would seem to me that it does mean that people can 't take vehicles on these reserves but i just want to have that clarified so the the wording that we we change we had the consumers around the definition of the word ordinarily so we 've taken that out and rewritten the clause and I think it 's quite explicitly a 9.1 a and B that how much more explicit do we need to go than that right okay motion towards just like to emphasize the fact that this panel clearly identified that the scattering of ashes was an important important issue for them for the community in no way did we think that we would just not include this the whole intent of the panel 's resolution at the end was to suggest a council that we needed a wider consultation on the matter to come up with a solution that was going to be acceptable to all parties I acknowledge that MKT is a significant partner in the city the only difference between what is proposed here and the amendment is the perhaps the inconvenience of having to go back and review an aspect one aspect of a vial or at a later date the same result is going to eventuate and it 's whether we have a need to actually be able to enforce some of the things that we are changing and amending in the bylaw now or do we wait for the whole lot to sit around for another six months or more before we end up with this consultation that is the matter it 's wrong or whether the scattering of ashes should or shouldn 't be allowed it 's a question of do we do this process by stalling the whole by law until we 've got the whole lot sorted or do we just accept that we 've got ninety nine percent of that sort of now get on with it past that and go can deal with the scattering of ashes that 's the salute the the issue and I believe that the resolution and the the amendment ultimately achieved the same goal it 's just a question of really whether we prepared to go back and review a bylaw in a few months time the same outcome is going to happen so it 's just the process of here you give it right okay so I 'm going to put the motion which is before you here okay you 're all aware of what you 're voting on can I put that those in favor please say aye and can I have a show of hands please one two three four those opposed what can you just put your hand up lost so what 's it um I 'm not going to vote otherwise it just gets me see oh well either way I 'm going to be sane because otherwise it 's going to get incredibly Missy so I 'm going to put andrew 's and andrew wants to move something else okay so the new motion would be to reject the report of the hearings panel and refer the matter to the full council for resolution of the outstanding issues okay thank you yeah I 'm Dave either which way about it makes no odds either which way I both it makes no odds it 's inequality it 's not caring okay so this is moved by counsel Turner seconded by pauline to reject the reports the hearing Sandra further to the council for a decision I 'm the whole thing or just online our weekend we have to do the whole thing don 't we in right sorry right so the only thing yeah yep okay so the advice is that this is the way in which you have to handle it okay right well I think we I put that or did somebody won 't speak not i 'll put it those in favor please say aye those opposed I have a show of hands those in favor it might be the same Andrew are you voting in favor of yours you want to put your hand up in okay i 'm putting Andrews amendment seconded by Pauline okay so if you 're in favor of it could you just put your hand up one two three four five if you 're opposed to it could you put your hand up right okay clear that carried otherwise we 'll be here all day right okay no it 's carried its carried it 's carried right okay um right well can we move on from that then _"

    "text": "its your right nine okay since we have all of the library people here we 're going to start with the library people would like to take this eat so welcome and thank you for coming would you like to introduce everybody who 's here because although we know you very well um some other people might want to know who you are and remember that you 're being live-streamed you deputy mayor he comes with my name 's Liam Nolan and the unit manager for the anchor projects good morning my name is cast an hour I represent the design team of architects and Schmidt hammer lassen on Peter Wars development director for the Inca projects team Carolyn Robertson 's library and information manager project sponsor Nation I 'm actually going to be quite liberal about the time just for once well thank you very much deputy mayor and thank you for the opportunity to briefly outline the design the proposed design for the new Central Library you 've got an internal image here behind you but before I explain the design in a little bit more detail I and parameters that have informed the design to date and those are primarily the outcome of the public consultation and in particular the council led campaign of your library your voice the desire to create a international standard library based on best international practice as well as urban design considerations and then quite importantly also trying to capture what we 've been describing as local identity what makes this building specific to Christchurch well touch on the on the on the aspects that we 've been integrated for that came out of the public consultation as we go through the presentation but if I could just start very briefly with some of the urban design considerations and as we know the library site is located on the northern edge of cathedral square the primary and civic space within christchurch in the heart of christchurch as such the square is as a as is a heritage feature and in particular the maltese cross shape of the square is something that the library needs to needs to strengthen at the ground plane however what we felt was very important is that the of what we call the urban carpet where the main Civic public space flows under the library and integrates the library with the primary space within the city on the next level up and I 'll describe this in a little bit more detail when we have some of the internal and external elevations is what we have called the community arena which is one of the key spaces within the library and represents the Civic the core civic functions at the library performs which is having giving people the opportunity to come together to exchange ideas and to disseminate knowledge so this space has been prioritized is on the first level and we 're looking to establish a clear relationship between that space and the square and then on the upper levels the building it is a rectilinear site as no doubt you 're aware the building in our view needs to help encapsulate the square and therefore needs to be quite a strong statement what we 've done now the next thing I 'd like to talk about is how we 've looked to articulate the building and 've worked very closely and established a very good dialogue with my tahoe and in particular the local hapu of nitro hariri and established with them how key values and cultural associations that are relevant to both the erie in the hapu can be integrated into the primary design considerations and what we have here are key physical points that are of relevance to as I say the Ely and the hapu and we are looking to integrate these both physically as well as implied into the design so we have the Southern Alps represented by Madera key mount cook we have to the south the banks peninsula to the north mango teary man gray and then in an implied sense all the way back to Hawaii he and overlaying these on to the actual site of the library has allowed us to use these ideas to help articulate that main body of the library and integrate these ideas substantially or make them at the core of the library design and as you 'll see in a minute what we have are these incisions going both both up to the page are terraces external spaces that can be occupied and that offer views the ones to the south literally two banks peninsula and some of the other and potentially to mount a gray and to the north and as I said some others more implied Mount Cook to the manta rocky to the west and Hawaii Kiki to the nor '-east you also see that cutout in the middle which is a atrium which is one of the central features and helps define and orientate people as they move through the building you have here now are one of the key internal spaces you 're at the ground level looking up into the atrium of the library and one of the key things that came out of the public consultation was really this desire for a welcoming place a place where people feel at home a low threshold to come into the building and something that excites and stimulates and sends people on an exploration literally through the building but also figuratively as far as acquiring information so this is a view you have to your right you see out street you 're at the base of the atrium the large stairs welcoming up into the building and being over dimensions so that these are our place where people can come together and and work and socialize as well as start their journey through the building as you make your way up through the building and you 're just arriving at the at the first level you see how light is introduced from high levels into the building and this main atrium space in further dialogue with nitro riri night Rahu and other stakeholders will represent a really good opportunity to integrate hard work and tell some more stories as you arrive on this first level you 'll see that this level has a very generous floor to floor height and is going to be one of the key areas you see beyond the community arena where people come together it will be a hive of activity a very active and place where people can socialize and again that 's come out of the consultation that there 's a desire for a variety of spaces spaces where you can be well as we 'll see when you travel up through the building to some of the upper levels more intimate spaces spaces for contemplation for quiet study and I and also and that came up very strongly in the consultation outdoor spaces that people can use as they use the library that are integral to the functions of the library and these are the spaces that I 've just outlined that form those physical and implied relationships to the natural surroundings and you can just see we 've follow if we 've illustrated in there the her on the horizon you would be able to see for instance the port hills which we think is really important for anchoring this project within the city and because it is about watching the city grow around you as well in these next year 's and that really brings me to I guess the second part the second idea of how we 've looked to explore this idea of the local what is local what is at the heart of Christchurch that people can relate to in different ways and that is the is something that is it 's really closed at the heart of cantabria and people in christchurch and the way that the light in a particular this time of year the colors of the landscape and the way that the light plays on the folds of the landscape the light the shadow those are things I think that we feel that people intrinsically will feel will feel they 'll be able to react to also then hierarchy key obviously something that is culturally very of great value to the local ewee but also that is relevant in a sense of it used to occupy the London marshlands and the site that the library now sits within so these are two references that we thought were very relevant and ideas that we wanted to reflect in the external expression of the building so we now have view of the project of the library sitting on the northern edge of the square you 've got essentially the cathedral behind you you 're looking north at the library and you can see on the upper levels the screen that that we have explored the landscape the folding nature the play of light and shadow and also the geometry of the flex and you can see on the upper level there some of the cutouts and end this in this case the terrorists looking to our south overlooking the port hills and the relationships still between the ground plane and those levels at the base you see a high level of transparency and at the ground plane this idea that I described before the urban carpet the square flowing in under the building and then in its prominent position the projecting element the the community arena that allows you to step out onto and overlook the square and we see here a view of the project at nighttime and we think this is obviously a key aspect of what the library needs to do the library is there to provide a strong Civic statement on what is the heart of Christchurch it needs to provide a safe environment it needs to activate the square not just during the daytime but for essentially 24 hours a day seven days a week and we think that the transparency that this building has that it will hopefully do so and be a place that instills civic pride in the citizens of Christchurch so I might stop there Vicki I hope that was brief enough and happy to take any questions thank you yes this dramatic concept that Carson 's just presented as the end point of a considerable amount of work by by the project team looking at at options looking at funding looking at affordability and we now have reached a point where we have a project that delivers on all of the the objectives that council is seeking to deliver the central library project and we 've got a vision and a concept now that we want to test with the market so we now propose to actually call for expressions of interest from suitably qualified organizations to design and construct thus this library and that 's the true we 're at the time now we wish to engage with the market we 're going down a design and construct route because we want to actually give the local contractors the opportunity to apply their building around the structure and the services but working within the parameters that this really exciting concept has designed provided nothing at this point was very happy to respond to any questions thank you I 've got a number of questions I 'll try and keep them as brief as possible first of all I 'd like to congratulate and commend the team for getting this project at this point in what it 's fair to say have been reasonably challenging circumstances certainly the presentation we 've seen this morning is a very positive step for the for the future of the city so great thank you very much for the presentation and for getting it to this point I 've got a number of questions most of them relate to the financial aspects and I don 't know who I should be and directing those two the first thing I know it is that the resolution is Caesars been asked to approve 85 million which is 25 million more than the 60 million city council contribution which is noted in the cost sharing agreement and I 'll break that may the first of which is the ten-million-dollar philanthropic contribution it would appear from the way the resolutions framed that that 10 million dollars is included in the 85 million that we 've been asked to approve today suggests that the council is actually underwriting that philanthropic contribution I didn 't see that as anticipated by the cost share agreement so if we get some comment on that first of all please it 's only so to break down the 85 million dollars its 60 million dollars as per the cost sharing agreements it 's 15 million dollars as pair the carp diem fund that was contributed to the project that 's locked into the long-term plan and also into our budget the ten billion dollars has been at risk on our project for a number of months throughout the project we report into that when working with ccd you and Sarah we 've formally request them to underwrite that we have a response from Sarah through ccdu which says they will use their best endeavours to secure that money but doesn 't underwrite the money so we are now 's been appointed again in ccd you and Sarah to pull together that money so that will start shortly so if that 10 million philanthropic funding is not found is it then expected that council would provide that 10 million dollars to the project as part of its contribution in line with the resolution today so when we come back to council for an investment decision on the tender we would need to have a discussion discussion then around that 10 million dollars philanthropic at the moment the tender includes for the construction and there 's also some wigs which are not actually part of that so the fits out works with the 10 million dollars expected to be spent but Peter can talk a little bit more around them generally in these sorts of projects the philanthropic components applied to programs to spacers and end equipment now all of those aspects are at the back end of delivery and so that gives us the opportunity to secure funding for those items as we go through both the procurement and the subsequent construction of the base build so so we that learning and and as Liam has pointed out our approach is to identify that the scope of the project it 's an 85 million dollar project that that you see in front of you that that is funded in various forms as set out and cost sharing agreement when we come back to council with a recommendation to accept a tender we will report on the status of the philanthropic funding and where we 're at and you also report on the likes of timing of that commitment so we haven 't directly asked for a commitment to then 10 million dollars today so in that 's correct you so in terms of today 's resolution yep if we were to amend that to provide 75 rather than 80 85 on the expectation at this stage that 10 million dollar philanthropic funding would be found before it was required that wouldn 't hold the project up in any way at this stage I defer to to some of my more experienced council colleagues here but we go to a proven 85 million one knowing that we 've only got 10 million dollars philanthropic donations comes forward we would potentially build the library but not fit out the top floor or something that got us into that current budget if that was the decision of the council in September changes yeah okay okay thank you so we 're on questions I 've got further than young oh sorry Andrew and I 'll keep them as quick as I can the 15 million from the betterment fund that decision has already been made by way of council resolution has it that 's my own stomach yep okay yep as long as it says we want in our juice I can go and check that counselor but a sin within our budget and CPMs on our long-term plan I think it 's by the previous cats or so it has already been made we can have that confirmed okay great thank you the government contribution it under the cost share is by way of the the land is my understanding has there been evaluation done on that land that measures up against the dollar amount of the contribution from government that 's land is actually in the pH of the land the land has now all been secured by the crown they own it 100% the value of that land is commercial information if the council 's wish that information I can request it and bring that back to a meeting yeah i mean my concern is the government are contributing the correct dollar value to the project and to have a level of confidence that that dollar value is actually covered by the contribution of the land they actually have vexation sir yeah I 'm not so worried about what 's been paid what I am worried about is that the value of that land is at least equal to the government 's committed contribution under the cost share and I think we need to have that information to know that that contribution has been made as it is it should be my only other couple of questions relate to where all of this sits in the annual plan long-term plan so the 85 million is contained within the long-term plan to propose to employment the 75 in five minutes so asked to approve today is not in the long-term plan that 's philanthropic okay and then just referring to Clause 5 point to the new Central Library is anticipated to use the entire budget and provision of this floor area within the budget will prove challenging my concern is that that sounds like a little bit like a placeholder for a cost blow out there are any risks of that happening and what would be the process in that case so the procurement route we have gone down on this project and we 've done a lot of market engagements that they start the project when the cost sharing agreement came out in 2013 and we 've also done of a set of fair market engagement more recently before we 've nailed our to procurement route that includes for a design and construct what that does it gives the budget and the cost certainty to the market so you actually come back to the client and give a price to build so therefore the documentation and the risk is not with the client it 's actually with the contractor allows back with the best cost solution so in terms of cost blowouts the solution we 've gone forward here with the document and design and build route is the best route for the client in terms of cost certainty victor is going to be industry for a number of people that we work on something that says something like Council recognize that it 's confirmed contribution to this project is currently 75 million that a report will come in September and that further debate will happen on the additional 10 million or or however much it is at that stage yeah okay we 've got something like that well we have the risk the questions and I 've forgotten who I acknowledged was it you feel sorry um my questions on the financing toe in 33.7 on page 32 there 's reference to the central recovery plan Sarah also purchasing the old library site and just wanting to we get it did we get I 'm funding in into in terms of their dead site to get money come back to council my understanding is that site has now been that 's been sold to save as part of the Convention Center sites and that mosel flow back to Council so at some stage and it could we could we learn what that what they remind us I can go back to our finance team and find out that amount there will be useful in terms of what we received that pat things um thank you um yeah I was concerned about the 10 million and whether we needed to consult around the spending of 10 million kieres give me some advice around there like whether we need to go out for us SCP or consult as part of a long-term plan the extra money there 's no I think sorry we just got told that there is no provision in our budget for the 10 million so we currently have nothing on budget for that team million so the 75 I understand the 15 and the six day but the 10 million was always supposed to come from the Sierra from philanthropic so today we 're being asked to invest up to 85 million and I 'm just mindful up to so yeah um and just in terms of like the design and if the scale 10 had some pre-engagement but did you consider having like you know opportunity for the public to comment on you know the the final design the draft final design or end yeah the we 've engaged extensively during the briefing and early stages with various stakeholders and as I said there 's obviously the account your library or voice campaign but the design as you see it at the moment has not been released or consulted on so is it possible to do that like and how because I mean you know not wanting to hold the project I 'm necessarily but recognizing this is such an important so that s edge I think it would be really valuable to help you know let the public provide comment around the use of the space and end the design the public consultation on the library I 've seen the report it 's incredible so Carolyn you might like to comment on it we will need to clearly do some more thinking about this but that we would and we 've touched on as that as as the design progresses because there are more stages of the design process which Caston can or Peter can detail to as we go through and then we 've got phases where we 'll be looking at the foot out and so on there are a number of phases where I think there are opportunities certainly to inform and also to get input in feedback from from the community so I think the short answer is yes there will be more opportunities I don 't see it and my colleagues will well correct me that actually now is the right time because i think as as a deputy mayor said we 've actually we 've heard a lot from the community to bring the design to the concept stage we 're very keen to get out and engage with the market and get the process underway we can go back to the community at key stages as the design is more finalized and shaped up and we look at it fit out and and activation of the stasis there team will be working with the project team on as the project progresses so I would see as we do with our other library projects our community library projects we like to engage inform and engage with the community as the as the project develops and progress I was just thinking of the design I mean I 've got a personal view on it but but I actually have no idea what the public think about my final design and this will be this will be the first time that goes into marker I she 's been kept under wraps until their council approval so it will go into the market now and we 'll feed some feedback but it must be seen that this is actually part of one of the number of projects in the city center and the architects of work of the teams for the convention center the square the Performing Arts precinct in the rest of the central recovery plan to make sure this buildin fits in with that so no I just meant from a public one of you if the public say we building and you know we support library but we don 't like this design is there any mechanism for us to reconsider that well I think as we go it 's been said before I mean the timelines until tender would be accepted is till sep tember so if there is an unexpected reaction i think there 's plenty of time in those four or five months that we 've got till then to react to that and our experiences really is the key thing as really as as demonstrating that the functions and the activities that the light that people have asked for as part of the consultation that it 's demonstrating that those are found within the design you 'll always get varying views within a community on design that 's just a matter of fact so I think was much more prone to people as really as will it give me the type of building the services that I 'm looking for and that is Carolyn has said is there 's significant amount of work still to be done that hasn 't even started yet and where where there 's no impression of being put before pre-decided outcomes already just two more questions one is I know the visit and justice image of so the justice and emergency praising doesn 't have to bride any visitor car parking is it anticipated that this building will have any visitor car parking not in the current design there 's no basement in this building so there 's no car parking provided on-site although some additional car parking for the service areas however there is the Performing Arts precincts adjacent which Council on the joint lead with ccd you and there 's called provision for car parking in that space and there has also been a expression of interest for car parking the council issued which closed yesterday so will this go through like a consent process in terms of a resource consent and have to weigh up the impact on traffic generation and car parking or as it does it have no minimum of site the site is already designated for our central library so we 'll go through an outline plan process which is basically bulk location you do _"

    "text": "this local bill Mike you like to kind of give us a bit of background on this and I can rub it and will join us in a few moments so this counselor will call that Riccarton racecourse was identified and the loop has an exemplary area for housing and you also recall that towards the end of last year council considered a report based on some work interaction with night are who who are looking at potentially the form and nature of development to see whether it would qualify as an exemplar project and at that stage the council said yes it 's it 's well on the way it 's not an exemplar project but you know keep having those discussions so and and as far as we know those discussions are continue to happen and the exemplar status was simply at the time when the loop was established was a mechanism to try and provide alternative pathways to get development happening so it was really aimed at basically saying well if you do x y&z we may be able to short track some of those discussions one Riccarton racecourse is that and karen or robert can explain what in more detail is that it 's subject to its own piece of legislation and so one of the first things that needs to be done if it is to make any progress is to have that legislation and mended to allow land to to be used for purposes other than race course and racing purposes the Minister Nick Smith in his room and his new role there 's as in this for the environment and we 'll see our seas notice if I can learn how building and housing of but not conservation met earlier this year was the council and said I 'm really interested in this and I 'm going to also admit what 's the mirror and Livia and and indicated that they that mb were very keen to facilitate the the change to the legislation that required a local purpose bill and then also looking he was exploring new mechanisms and different mechanisms to facilitate the development of that and to establish some higher density urban outcome so there was a process by which suppose on the Luke objectives for a high-density housing an area who 've been identified it was able to be serviced it did require a process to be gone through for a piece of legislation to be entered and amended to enable that to occur and that requires the council to be prepared to support a local purpose bill before the house to make that happen so the Genesis that 's the genesis of this report this report brings that back and so we 're seeking your approval to pursue that course of action and that just got a question around the infrastructure if we allow you know just to proceed is there any infrastructure constraints on this being developed and two residential in other words what we 've got other areas where some their ass infrastructure is that night and I be seen and we can 't allow any more development so all I 'm just fleeing is it is this an area that would be affected by that constraint so from the previous discussions that we 've had around the exemplar process which this proposal was within my concern particularly from NZTA is a and the strategic roading Network yelled who strode and I don 't recall it the array any count particular council infrastructure meters that unable to be addressed just on there then what are the constraints of the road network that could be a it 's the additional traffic that would go that would be moving on to your host road in particular just on the exemplar status of this project going back to the 27th November obviously some concerns were expressed at that time around whether the project was likely to meet the requirements of the exemplar status and what those what that meeting would look like Mike in his introduction this morning sighs you know as far as we know discussions around the issues that we raised on 27th November are continuing to happen the first line of paragraph 2.3 whether in pursuit of the example our project or referred as a specific project under the housing Accord also suggests that there continues to be a question around the exemplar status and it may well be that the reason that some of us the affordable housing component of the exemplar project it may be that support wouldn 't be so forthcoming for a project that didn 't deliver those objectives it is there any update on this because I think it 's relevant to the debate that we 're having tonight I said I think there 's but yes so so as some as the enemy as outlined that 's the case and I think he 's also indicated some interest in the timing of delivery on this speed of delivery so some some and there 's been discussions about you know how you might how they might the Riccarton racecourse trustees will need to sign up to actually delivering certain numbers by certain time frames etc so so so some of those things are certainly very much in the frame of the minister as we understand it weather weather that then formally follows the exemplar model or whether in fact the model shifts because the opportunity is for them to have the have the have the changes to the legislation to allow them to use the land but also then the Riccarton behalf could seek a private plan change as part of the district plan review and process the change to the zoning and the provisions through that mechanism as well so the fact that the Minister has made those comments particularly around affordability but a third will be affordable does that then meet the affordability criteria for the exemplar project like would that be defined as the same thing that we would expect to see around affordability through the exemplar yes yes the change was the density it 's there are fewer houses then in the original proposal as well it 's about 200 fewer in their announced sonota who have become the development partner in this which is a step forward as well and they are very keen to go fast and to make make them affordable and so I 've got yani full can t so I 'm just interested in how 450,000 is seen as affordable well that 's probably not a question you can ask us I mean that 's the the government has their home start threshold it 's just sit around net figure so I were using so a third the third of the properties had to be eligible for the government 's home start what it was called package okay yeah no I know that but so we have no advice around what 's of what we would consider a full one crusher to at the moment but we don 't compare it to people 's income well we rose at this point that that that those drivers are being driven by the minister and his discussions with the Riccarton racecourse community what we 're being asked to do is to support a bill to enable the land to become available for housing well actually for affordable housing and that those so it 's not for a full with housing that the bill is around actually releasing the land okay so I 'm just reading 3.8 that the development of the site has you know to be around the 3.8 the affordable housing this is power secure thirty percent of total number of points that is affordable home so about what I 'm struggling to understand us have 450,000 is affordable because it 's I just I haven 't seen any evidence that see it 's that that 's affordable I don 't know what do you know what the scope the size of these homes will be will they like one bedroom homes or two we did see quite a lot yeah but we did see quite a lot and example we did see a lot but but I think is that it be me is outline i think there 's this you know things have traveled quite a bit since that time and obviously different parties are looking at how they 're going to deliver the outcome what it 's going to look like the message i suppose that we 've received from the minister is that he 's interested in that sort of thirty percent of affordability as the crown defines it and obviously he 's a key player in this but also that these are achieved in a timely manner so we 're having to take that at face value at this stage the first step in the process for us is actually will we support a bill going forward potentially and as a hollow stick behind that to me under the other so i think the bigger question for me is there 's any need for this land to be resigned to house and giving how much land we 've already got currently zoned for housing particularly in the central city and in some of the other greenfield areas that still hasn 't been developed on and we 've had partnerships with the minister and with the government in night are here before and we haven 't seen those houses being developed in the time frames that they 've agreed so why do we need to develop thus a head of those being complete well i think that there are still so so there 's potentially a number of ways you can answer that and i suppose from our perspective in a global sense the market will decide what needs to be available and the uptake will be dependent on how the market responds to that but i think as we 've said as far as we understand from the minister 's intention there will be quite set deliverable the market we do know it will be a higher density and certainly some of the early stuff and a middle ii it 's only the early stuff that we 've seen is of that sort of more high-density typology with multiple units and joined apartments and townhouses so we will be seeing perhaps one of the comforts we could take is that we 're giving a delivery of some type of medium density housing within a time frame that actually offers something different by way of housing typology so how the that will respond to that obviously we can 't predict that but at least it provides a different offering in the market and potentially an offering with some real time frames around it and some of the response about the affordability to button I just wondered about the Community Interest part in this and that I understand for example there are some residents in the near vicinity and this refers to part 77 1 and the third bullet point down on page 34 6 just that so what we 're doing though is that community concerns about development 's so this is an area we 're in fact by deciding us today those residents concerns won 't be be at least by council not at all it 's important to understand what the decision the council is being asked to make today and the decision is purely to promote a local bill to be introduced into Parliament to enable the or to change the statutory trust upon which the land is held the bill doesn 't allow the development it doesn 't it doesn 't it doesn 't mean that the land will be developed it 's just one of the steps along the path that will be required to ensure that happens but along the path and starting at this point when the local bill is introduced to Parliament it will go to a select committee that be ample opportunity for public consultation there 'll be resource consent processes require plan plan change processes required again ample opportunity for public consultation so there 's a whole range of steps that are required in the future this particular decision is a very narrow limited one that you 're made that the significance assessment that we have in paragraph seven please like public consultation to follow public consultation by government by government through government does its and and through the council plan changes i think we what we also what i signaled earlier is that our understanding is that that the trustees would then seek a private plan change through the review of the district plan to undertake the actual rezoning of the land and obviously that has a submission process and a further submission process so people will be able to participate in that manner thanks for that reassurance and verify that so when that goes out people will have the normal rates not the current well in many respects the current rights are not at that point in the process are not that too similar to normal rights there will be a full submission period there will be a full further submission period so those will be there and it will be publicly notified well if that 's the if that 's the direction of travel and that 's how we understand the responsibility for the trustees need to get your skates on will be to develop and lodge a private plane change anticipating the local bull going through and just just one further question I 'm assuming from what you see that an in 532 on page 345 that the minister who would sponsor this would be the minute by the MP who 'd sponsored likely to be the minister next month yes the drafter has his name on it okay thank you q so I assume that if this should all go through the trust would then sell the land or will they still retain that land what 's the i 'm sorry i don 't know that i may not privy to the details of how those financial arrangements between the trust my tire who as the e we have certain rights in this process if it gets so but we don 't know those details it 's my question really from that is around 6.1 that they are often to contribute to the cost of the the bill is that appropriate absolutely it 's not a council driven bill we 're being asked here 's a promote is that that that 's the legal term it 's the legal terminology but to turn our interest is merely as the local authority we 're not we have we don 't have a financial interest we 're not going to make any money out of this so the trustees who are should pay right so should they pay for the whole thing on you did they then pay for the whole thing not just contribute to it there 's other costs besides that too thin for the two the two thousand dollars is the direct cost that has to be paid to the clerk of the houses office on introductions of all introduction of the bill so there will be staff costs as well well my question is should they pay for all of those costs well when I suppose in some respects this is a this is around how do you treat this in terms of recovery we 've had to do a little bit of work to facilitate this the drafting the bills large being done by the parliamentary Council they will carry through its passage will be presumably held by carried by Parliament in some way or by the government I think yes we look we could we could look to recover those some of the costs of its bender today but I think they 'd be relatively minor in the schemes of things and really is it actually worth pursuing I don 't know that it is so staff will negotiate how much that they will contribute to that two thousand no no that cost is being paid by the trustees answer was not funding there okay so 641 says they would contribute so okay data- councils contribution as a staff time okay thank you my questions really for the strategy and planning of the city and in the lateral spread of people and opening up more green fields were not actually intensifying the brownfields and wish to have 20,000 people in the city centre so the question really is do you think with this a large amount of land made available is there going to impact our desire to intensify our brownfields well argue this could be seen as a existing city framework so it actually supports that whole western end of your ters and it 's between hornby and sort of i suppose coming coming north through to rusty so it 's actually inside the oven frame i mean we we have promoted through our living g zones we do promote higher levels of density in suburban areas and not all our density needs to be in the center and end of the day i don 't think that the role of counselors to say actually we 're going to squeeze everything else to try and achieve something because i think the limited ability to actually make that happen becomes quite limited so what I think what we need to is be confident that actually the level of intensity of development here is appropriate for that for that area it can be it can be managed and then it becomes part of the suite of I suppose offerings to the market and actually getting some breath in the market has also been one of our objectives I see that under the civil assessment you you talk about being low and wider community of carrying out the decision they not have been identified but I would have thought this has a pretty big impact on race day on record and market on all the other activities that a banana these have been assiduous I think would be the word in terms of protecting everything that they need for the operation of racing when you were coming by the way the horse swimming pool when you look at the read my understanding from cut day is Maurice know that they that that whole area is huge amounts of car parking and people so I 'm kind of puzzled as to why you would need that whole extent of that area for this development trustees to identify so the trustees had identified there they see when they look at the car parking because they 've got pictures of it out there that they can fit them in because they 're all over the place that they can fit them into the area that they 've got so the trustees are very focused on racing everything that they need for racing for cup tell me is the same as wine industry in terms of the value to their due to the country um has been protected and actually there 's a massive amount of stuff that they 've got out there that 's Christ and in the traffic assessment so when will we be in a position to see the traffic assessment because I don 't personally believe that we can deal with that through the the belv thing so I would have as a pre signature mr. Kano closest a pain change process that would a trophic assessment would be needed as part of it it would not form part of the material that you 're considering today right but if those big strategic pictures that are traffic networks can 't cope with that amount of development in this face I would have thought that 's pretty significant to the cost to the right that 's a matter for the plan change process this decision is simply do we promote a bill that changes the statutory trusts that govern the use of the land knows what we dealt with through the plane a question of significance and all I 'm asking is given that the traffic issue as significant then it hasn 't been identified in here why this this isn 't a planning document this isn 't the document that will provide the plan change or the resource consent to enable the development to happen this is just simply a decision to change the statute or disturb to assist the process to change the statutory trusts that govern the use of the land it doesn 't mean anything any development will actually happen on this land the just one further quick question sorry and the need for this project obviously was identified through the loop the desirability of it was identified to you live we at that time obviously identified a need for housing of this sort of intensity on this type of brownfield development we 're now hearing in some quarters that there 's a potential for oversupply of housing as early as 2017 how does the timing of this proposal tie in with that because again approving something to solve a housing shortage of housing crisis now is one of housing as early as 2017 makes it a very different question so I think again come back to the core that this is empowering and creates opportunity so I think you know as through the through the loop through the end I suppose through the particular tool of the exemplar this was seen as a large piece of land a good opportunity to realize some new development and additional housing development and of course you 'll realize around the country that in fact many race courses have again for different reasons realize some of their land assets so you only have to go to green lane or around alexandra park or course raceway to see so or addington to sitting absolutely yes you need to go up the road to see that that 's how what is happening around those as again these these sort of requirements change you know I suppose I see that in terms of our answer that in terms of saying there 's a there 's an issue for the for the potential developers to go into that with so certainly if there 's going going to be quite a key issue if the proponents of any formal development are going to be saying well actually I 've got a 23 year and five-year horizon for delivery if I don 't think i can sell those cause they 'll be an oversupply am I really going to engage with this so there may be a degree to which that is self managing but equally we also know that that this is an area of the city that is is you know relatively well placed for the development it 's it 's surrounded by modern infrastructure it 's surrounded by good access to the airport to other parts of the city so this may become quite you know it may still in the in spite of the glow around supply it may still be a very successful development thank you I won 't be supporting this I think I can 't see the need for this land to be Ruiz owned now we 've actually spent a huge amount of time rezoning and a number of areas for residential development and sadly what we haven 't been waiting and waiting and waiting we always told well leave it to the market the market isn 't delivering affordable housing and just rezoning more land and particularly for affordable housing at 450,000 which I do not believe as affordable and I really challenge you know the idea that you simply give people greater subsidies to buy more expensive housing as having any positive impact on the housing affordability in our city with just a posle seems to be based on so I can 't see the need to get rid of valuable reserve lens such as a racecourse certainly to this extent I think I mean I I hear that we advise that the trustees of said they don 't take it all have any negative impact on record a market or on the races that they have there I know from personal experience having attended some of those events more recently when they had Japan day and rekelen market at the same time you just think about the traffic impact that it currently has now the traffic issues and you think of all this being high density 's been proposed so I can 't support this I didn 't support it being a late supplementary item you 've seen this number of questions that you know we I I 've had on this that 's right i think it 's good when it doesn 't come through a committee or doesn 't go through the proper normal process I understand the government want to do things around housing we 've got a number of things that we 're still waiting on them to do in regards to housing city which i would encourage them to help us with rather than look at these new projects which i don 't think there 's a clear business case or rationale for and i think this will have a big detriment to our central city we want people to come and live in the central city continuously opening up these brownfield greenfield sites on the fringes of our city doesn 't make any sense at all and I take on board the point that 's made that we face an oversupply of lens own 4000 in a few years time 'm just going to speak first I think that you 've missed the major point major point is that what we need the houses we don 't need sections we have a lot of sections but this actually requires them to develop housing on it the bill that that made this race the rest of the land in them was what 1876 or something when this would have been 1878 when this would have been so far away from the center of town that it would have been amazing to try and develop it I think the racecourse trustees have actually done a very good job of looking at what they need for the racecourse and then trying to make their own assets sustainable if you look at the map this is a very urban part of Christchurch and it has facilities all around it it has schools universities and shopping centers very near and obviously there will be traffic issues and there will be issues that neighbors raise and they get the chance to do that this is not the time that they that they make their public submissions because we think that these people are all otherwise going to come and live in the center of town is frankly absurd these people will go and live in sulwon and why Mac we will create more traffic jams out going out to Womack and we will create more traffic jams going sulwon I liked the idea that where we have unused land and it can be used for housing we do something about that and I like the fact that they 've actually done it an agreement that requires them to deliver in a short period of relatively short albeit with a lot of process to go through they can as i understand it actually put housing on this now but they can only lease it for seven years at a time and anybody who 's dealt with leased land and christchurch knows that it is the least loved form of the land that people buy in christchurch because it has all sorts of issues about your future costs the only way we are going to get people houston christchurch is to build houses yes the government is doing they 'll be making some announcements about that in a couple of weeks we 're starting to dig on the site and yes we are doing a major push in terms of a community becoming a community housing provider yes we 're doing all those things but this actually allows other people to build houses what 's the worst that can happen we actually reach equilibrium in the market if there is ever such a thing because I suspect a whole lot of people coming into Christ which are going to stay here sooner than we would have otherwise fantastic I would like they 're not to be a housing problem in Christchurch that 's why i 'll be voting in favor of this because i said i think and i know this area very well it 's in my ward i think it makes perfect sense that it is developed for housing there is everything that the racing industry needs retained even the record and market is retained and so i think this step is absolutely essential and then the rest where the public come in and say all in changed so so I will certainly be supporting it Glenn think you also put it too although I do have some interesting or rather some questions as councillor your hints and does over the affordability aspect of it and I 'm bad that 's the government 's definition and they can stay with it my questions are also surrounding the economic models that have always been used in this recovery that the less a fair approach has been taken to leave it to the market approach whereas an interventionist approach was required and we see aspects of that in this when it talks about a speed to clamp down online banking etc so I do have a few questions about it I still think as a council we have to hold up our end of the bargain and promote this it 's all it 's one thing for us to challenge the government over housing and sometimes to receive that the other way but at the end of it we actually have to work together on it and we do have to put houses on the ground I 've we 've got a partnership and in different ways one way through being through the Accord I think we just have to keep pushing on it those opposed just do you want that recorded jaani jaani would like to smoke recorded against thank you and _"

    "text": "to there there are no petitions are there no but there is a deputation from karen terrace welcome Karen just so people understand deputations refer to something that is on the agenda for discussion today so Karen speaking about the city mission grant good morning madam okay I actually wrote down what I wanted to say this time every other time I 've winged it and done okay but didn 't want to forget anything so just fear with me I 'm first up I just want to say thank you to all of you for taking homelessness and taking in the Christchurch housing situation seriously and being so compassionate about it it 's been really great what contact I 've had with you over the last year and in regards to the city mission project I want to thank the City Council and all the people who have been involved in giving it to the point it said at the moment also will the forward planning going forward to support the needs of the shelter and working with the city mission to support families in need and improve their want to say a lots been invested in this project already a lot of time and finances a lot of emotion but i think my point today is with winter approaching finalizing and refurbishing the mission building i 'm feeling that time is quite critical during winter substandard accommodations such as overcrowded housing people live any garages and sheds and cars and this is happening or wheres living on the street is I feel quite unacceptable since the earthquakes in the past four years housing options have become very limited and expensive making it really challenging for the people that are living on the streets or people that are living in those not the greatest of living conditions to find or keep permanent stable accommodation many people lost their homes on or before februari 22nd and since then many more have also found themselves without a roof over their heads there 's no doubt the earthquakes have had a long term impact on the housing situation and a number of people needing housing has grown and it 's still very high end new housing builds are great but they 're the people that we 're looking at that will benefit from the services and the shelter our winter conditions here in Christchurch are really harsh I know I go out at Latimer and I spend an hour a night with these people and it 's freezing and I get to go home to a warm house and the shelter will give some of those people or some other people with children that are out there a place that 's they can take their kids that 's warm and dry I think the shelter will change lives that will give families options and help empower them to deal with tough situations and empowerment giving them that back is really important and supporting them to move forward into stable housing and a secure environment to raise their children there 's so many challenges out there for a vulnerable are lower income people that don 't have housing the shelter will help provide a way to not only remove that challenge but work through other challenges and support them back into a place they can move forward from the shelter will go some path forward for Christchurch earthquakes have had a marked effect on housing and the types and numbers of homeless we have but the reality is that many of our homeless emerging lives and they 're struggling to feed or clothe their families to keep them warm or keep them healthy having the shelter open and operating for this winter 2015 is really urgent moving forward on this as soon as possible as needed to give those who help most somewhere safe together these situations if any of us were to find ourselves in the position of homelessness which is pretty hard to imagine that it could happen trying to care and provide for a family for children while looking for or maintaining employment would certainly be a struggle being cold and being homeless is not a way that 's not a way of life and and you can 't move forward you can 't look after a family you can 't look after yourself if you 've got nowhere to live yeah i just think christchurch is an awesome city to live in ashley and i think that we all again to make it strong again and it 's not just about the buildings but about our people as well so yeah my point is that the sooner the better when it is only weeks away and these people really struggle thank you thank you Karen thank you for all the work you 've been doing on this behind the scenes and your work as a quiet advocate as with the community and later the square if we pushed for because the shell of the building is already there so if we pushed to compress the time frame by say the start of june and really pushed on that the report suggests four months which in my view is too long so if we pushed for the start of june with that what would this want to be today yeah i mean today would be great obviously that 's not going to happen the start of juniors when it does start to get really tough yeah from from June onwards it 's really really hard out there and and whether people are living on the streets of the living in living in really cold conditions scene for little children which is what the shelters for really it 's just not okay so yeah I think June would be fantastic yeah thanks Karen and just tell me if you can answer this one because it 's a wider question really around like this we 're Toph re ro matter might fit with this program because I understand and like you 'll be counseled be aware that they have looked after reasons who are vulnerable and often without housing for a long time can you are you able to tell us where where they may be able to go because I understand they 're likely be relocated even said that you may not be able to know I can 't tell hear the answer the big questions all right no I don 't know I don 't deal with them so I don 't know much surrounding them thank you thank you deal what they later in the agenda and I 'm now going to

're and also you go tell us who you are in a minute thank you avondale residents association thank you we thought it 'd be better to thank you so some of the groups that we represent okay awesome so just so you 're aware there is 10 minutes that includes question time yep and because I 'm in the chair it will be quite strictly enforced yep I have my five guns ready to go okay thank you very much just like to point out that this presentation is not just the tomato Park neighbors it 's a number of organizations you 'll see in the next slide through the slide doesn 't seem to be up I 'm not sure how it gets up on the screen thank you the objective tonight um yeah and I 'm i represent tomorrow Park neighbors but I also was a member of the community advisory group or the eastern repression that we 're Becky and having to make this deputation because the promise that came out of the fourth of September meeting last year has been has not been delivered basically just to point out that in the background of this presentation that 's the area we 're talking about that 's essentially the bill would Pegasus ward so that is the underpinning against what 's good for the build Pegasus Ward is what we 're about these are the organizations that have specifically endorsed this presentation and we 've had conversations with others but we ran at a time trying to get them to to make a decision so it is rather a widespread group that we 're representing and I just want you to keep that in mind as we go through this I 'm just gotta next slide the basic message is that the presentation that you 're going to have this afternoon or later today around the scope of the Eastern sports and recreation and how the management might be managed between the pool and the high school we don 't support that scope we made essentially where we 're saying that it 's great that we 've got progress but we haven 't had the engagement that was promised and that we believe is necessary to ensure that the community gets the best result that they that they need just take you back into history that 's the annual plan 2012 what was decided and I know people say tom has moved on but there 's expectations have been set and this is one of the first promises that unfortunately hasn 't been delivered and we do appreciate the sort of pressure that the council has under financially etc but the pressure that the all that the community out in the yeast is under is pretty severe as well and we need to have some stuff that will serve us well for the future now here are the key issues that we see and you will have a handout in your run in your pack a series of black and white sheets that expand on these issues the first one is that both based on the terms of reference and also the decision that was advisory group to inform the scope of the of the Eastern recreation and sports facility has not been done we 've had one meeting which essentially was here is the scope thank you very much goodbye that happened on the 11th of december i wrote to the mirror on the fifteenth of december and have been following up since then to try and get an answer and why that concrete decision in the minutes wasn 't done and it is really disappointed that we have to come back here and sort of essentially oh sorry wrong wrong laptop the that we 're back here trying to achieve what we thought we had achieved at that point you 'll see that in the first detail sheet we 're talking about that last bullet point in terms of reference that 's a direct copy from the terms of reference and if you go to the next page that 's a quote straight out of the decision i 've rewatched that the video of that presentation or the live streaming on for September and the promised the the the passion behind it I of goodwill there 's a lot of you know determination to continue with the community advisory group process but we find that that really hasn 't happened the second point is we 're really concerned about the capacity of the pool particularly now that the high schools have been are going to be right next door you know it 's going to creak under the strain of the demand and soon as somebody tries to book it for some sports facilities for some sports program or any other group that might sort of take a load proportion of that pool that one pull will be out of action for the rest of the community and if you look at the second sheet around the issue too you 'll see the sort of closures that Dudley Aquatic Center has had over the recent times and also some information out of that was in the press in January around the sort of closures they 've been going on with places like Graham Condon one stop pull it 's an all-or-nothing it gets taken out with lose the pool we lose the facility the next one the sea at Graham we thought was going to look like a big being something that was really exciting it 's a there 's six point five min involved worth of excitement for the children of the east and what we don 't see we don 't see that in the scope that 's been proposed and we 're really concerned that we 're frittering in our bitten here in a bit there and it may be done for good reasons but the community hasn 't been part of that decision making hasn 't been part of that trade-off and that 's that 's a concern the next point around that the the high schools is not so much the high schools being there I 'm apparent I 've got two children it 'll probably go we 're going to that high school at some point so from the personal point of view that 's great fantastic but how the wider community works with the high school and makes sure that we have a decent sort of sharing process is really a boring Graham Condon is brought who just do not go to ground fondant because of the load on that facility and we 're not just talking about mornings and evenings we 're talking about during the day people who are retired people who have you have to do aqua jogging or other perhaps rehabilitation type training in the pools a lot of people avoid it and the times I 've been the if you go in the morning the water is nice and clean towards the end of the day it 's not so pristine and it really does seem to creak under the load and the final point is really specifically around the community advisor group process there was a lot of promise to it and there was a lot of time committed by the people who went there and they 'll certainly some very positive comments made at that fourth of September meeting from Council are saying how good the process what it was and at that point I thought great that 's fantastic we going to continue to be in me but it just died on the vine don 't know why way I just don 't know why I 'm just saying that 's that bad whole process just died on the vine and we never got anywhere further after their fourth or September meeting so we really need somebody to step up and give us that involvement that collaboration key thing we don 't want to do is slow this process we 're talking about parallel work not slowing it down we 've lost six months since the fourth of September it 's over six months we 've had one community advisory group meeting that didn 't fulfill the decision so we want to be able to work with the council we want to be involved we feel like we 've being sort of sidelined again and it may be for good reasons that from the people who have made these decisions or it might have been accidental but the result is where our on the outer again knocking on the door saying can we please come in again we feel like we 're outside the tent changing the skype now if it does need to change if there 's cheaper to do it now that in one that the detailed designs are done because if you have to go and do that all over again it 's always the time it 's a waste of money and it 's a waste of the commitment in the end people will be waiting for something for longer worst case we just go down the train and we end up with a facility that people do not support turns into y del that was the worst case for everybody counselors the community sorry um okay final point I 'm sure you 'll get copies of this we really believe that the the commitments from september 's should be brought into back into the fold and urgently really engaged the community preferably through the community advisory group so that we can be part of this process again and fulfill the promise of the community advisory group process because i think it 's strong if it 's actually followed through them i think really that covers pretty much all I 've wanted to say that if you 've got any comments Chris I think I just see on page 20 one of our report says counter officer presented the quantity of the bigger report to the community advisory group on the limit of December and it 's got a number of things down there I also know in the recommendations that we 've been given the board was satisfied staff reduce their concerns raised by deputations from yourself and keep qe2 and Parkman 's residents so just wondering if you just um what you 've said to us seems to be kind of contradictory to what is in here can you just help me understand where the differences I guess it 's just a difference of people seeing the same issue from different sites the the committee board obviously decided that our concerns have been addressed but the community doesn 't hold that view and there 's there 's a lot of people in the community that hold that view that we 've been pushed down that track the meeting on the eleventh December was not a consultation it was an information provision we were being informed of the scope we were not informing we 've haven 't had that trade-off you know certain perhaps it 's the right scope but maybe this entitles that would give us a better overall view stay within the budget but nobody 's ever had the opportunity from the community to say we 'll take that out put that in how about a bit of this that will give the community as a whole a better result it 's about the utility for the whole community not just particular areas thanks cousin and this is obviously on the agenda and the bill would pick asses community board and I 'll see if I can bring that forward a bit for you but we do have another deputation at the moment thanks guys Eric _"

    "text": "sorry I 'm sewing a staff card at the same time okay look what I want to know with us as I remember we dealt with us when I was cheering strategy and planning and in my heart of hearts I 've always actually felt this is inevitable the by the bridge will be crossed at some point and I just feel like we 're treating water and we 're seeing the same stuff again and again and as you quite correctly say the hot spots do move and we 've done that softly softly approach for as long as I can remember even before I was on count set with Kremlin square so how long does this sort of nonsensical water treating continue what do you need from us to actually what as far as a resolution goes to progress investigating a by Lord we just simply move option to that that we are stuff to investigate a Bible or under the freedom camping act when you live in and that 's that is that what you need from us I don 't know if they 'll be support it is we would need um between now and when we do the by little bottles going to take a lot of time and that 's why I 'm worried about the staff resource that goes in so maybe they 're not Park Rangers maybe they 're just called coastal ranges or Beach Rangers but I do think we need to think about a dedicated resource well I mean is that I just the answer i got back before said that part Rangers don 't you know they do parks and reserves so can I just check who 's doing the coastal areas and do would it be useful to have a dedicated resource we currently have a dedicated resource that we 've been funding in bearing in mind freedom camping actually and we 're seeing it will really the numbers drop as we hit into the winter months and then start again we 'll probably get back and we started in October this year we think probably if we do it again we 'd start and November and look to that part of that dedicated resources part of our would continue to fund that dedicated resource and the new LTP and just carry on with the work that we 're doing and the interim we 're working really closely with Park Rangers and parking compliance team in our parking and compliance and enforcement team to manage as best we can freedom can he activities I 'm I 'm sort of starting to waver on this in the direction of maybe a by laura is the way to achieve what i want what there are two questions I I need ancestor to help me make a firmer decision on that the decision we 'd be making today if we went with option two would be to ask you to investigate a bylaw that doesn 't mean that we will end up with a bylaw there 's another point along that decision-making continuum where we actually make that decision finally isn 't that yes once we 've got that more information yes we we had to bring to you all the information in the supporting documentation about you do or do not want to consult on the Bible yep and then track of establishing a bylaw what we 're going to get is real difficulty establishing where the appropriate place for freedom camping is because of course anybody in the community where we say this is an appropriate place of freedom camping is likely to come back and say to as well not in my backyard a little bit like you know some of the other bylaws that we 've had in the last couple of years and I think it 's probably some of the intense we 'd have to move into pretty quickly around establishing the criteria for what makes an ideal came freedom camping site and then working on identifying what those potential sites are around this district and in doing consultation around those so do you believe such places exist where we won 't get huge amounts of negative community feedback I don 't don 't yes yes and I think those are as market and there 's market interest to actually be provide for this mesh type market and and it 's a matter of these sorts of things coming online in on yeah I do a combination of prohibited areas from Council potentially if those are identified some more restricted areas around where it can happen is it is currently and also relying on the market to actually bring some other legitimate camping environments for them and I just clarify because Glen 's amendment makes it makes a point good here option two is to develop a bylaw but then in there and so that 's what if we wanted to develop by law we go with option two can I just be clear can I just get some sort of read of the council so you know where you 're debating from a bit sensible so can I have so there 's two choices as it seems to me option one is the non below approach option two is the by door approach by law a six hour five point one point three on for 45 different councils to make a bylaw under the freedom camping it outlining areas where freedom camping is prohibited or restricted is that what the bylaw would be not the bylaws saying this is where you can know the it has to identify prohibited here else so if that 's the case I would I would be happy to support a body right okay so it 'd be clear are we clear because all I want to do is get an indication this is not a vote but rather than have a debate for two hours I just would really think it would be helpful is this going to contribute to them I think we also need to carry on and still do right for ya while we 're doing that yeah ya know all of those tidy up things can be done but I just really would be helpful I think for whoever is going to move amendments and things just to get an indication of Pete of where people are at could we possibly do include things one put up your hand in a minute if you 're a not in favor of a by Laura and one if you are so there K is it easy so maybe we will start it with the positive so are you in favor of a bowl or could we lot of debate isn 't it so could we perhaps would something that took account of the feeling around the table and that dealt with all those things and have you got something in which is it but I 'd still like to make it more explicit lyrics is an option too so to investigate developing a bylaw under the freedom camping in 2011 it says non-regulatory was it the right so so let 's just be really clear on it so we don 't yeah mentzer with staff and escaped the development of a is it says on page at the top of level 2 by law to what 's the root and to develop a file or under the freedom camping it under the freedom camping act Jeremy the league 2011 living just pretty much a copy and paste of topic so 40 Christy we 're doing as a possible amendment staff investigate the development of a bylaw under the freedom camping act 2011 and report back to the council on may 2015 is it what you want to have happen that 's your proposed timeline right so that people want to be in the act oh you 've got to propose where it comes through what does does any committee have freedom gimpy Reagan consents yeah yep Andrew I 'm really keen given that we 've got different issues in different parts of the city that community boards should have a strong and input into this process every stage as possible and I don 't know whether we need to capture that in the resolution today but certainly I know the issues along the eastern seaboard and on the peninsula pratts quite different and more pronounced than in some other areas sitting so I 'd be very keen particularly for the community boards in those affected areas given that they 're the people that really know the lie of the land locally have as much input into every stage of this as possible okay so can we amend that in perhaps Chris staff investigate the development of the bowl or under the Freedom temping act as outlined an option to and report back to the council via the regulations and consents committee and the appropriate community boards don 't think anybody 's yep that 's fine you comfortable with it got are you comfortable there yeah okay is there any other changes amendments well it seems well it 's potentially potentially some contradiction there is there is a point we are off so saying take off perhaps with no matter or regulatory yeah and we just range of measures but so we start with this one and then is there anything else you want to put in there so we 've involved the community boards we 've gone to the right committee which turns out to be yours ref and is there anything else cool do we need to investigate ways of managing the issue like if we could need to identify some sites where we can actually manage the issue and the facilities around there i think they need to ruin it because it 's a growing industry and it 's not going away and I just think whilst we reproduce what you want up here I just think it within these three years an investigation into alternative sites for these people can be located where the alcohol capsized but these people are no no let 's not get into that though it was no no we 're not going into that so what do you want to move pool that I just think we need to identify some science we can s you 'd manage this savagery that the report look at some potential sites we have reasonable people we know around the city over the South Island freedom camping over the holidays I 'm assuming that there some so so that that report could include that is that ok with you guys right include sites which welcome freedom campus yeah okay anything else we want to put in there if not is there a seconder for this yeah full ok can i maybe put that okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried unanimously okay that 's that i 'm assuming it was the motion was it yes I don 't need to put anything else or if it is developed it comes back to Council for approval does huh yep it 's outlined in the process and I think okay right I 'm moving on to item 28 which is a hefty little piece of work _"

    "text": "welcome back and thank you thank you for that before and right we 're on item 27 okay yeah and I some 27 freedom camping welcome and would you like to just talk to us first and and then we 'll get on to the which options we like and those sorts of things but okay sure absolutely so I guess this report is basically it provides two options for council to consider one is that we continue to use existing regulations on a case-by-case basis to deal with freedom camping issues as they arise and we do discuss some of the positives and negatives associated with that option and the report the second option is to develop a a district-wide approach to through a freedom camping by law the pluses in negatives we do also discuss in the report clearly a district wide by law does provide you with the option to provoke to produce a coherent regulatory approach using a specific piece of legislation exactly for freedom camping I guess the negative of it it doesn 't guarantee that you can respond i 'm on a case-by-case basis regulatory the existing regulatory methods for the air and it doesn 't guarantee that you can actually use the infringement finds mainly because people may leave the country before paying for the fines the first option which is to continue using the existing regular regulations the negatives for that is it i guess it 's the opposite really and then it doesn 't give you the opportunity to be coherent a consistent district wide approach but it does allow you to respond immediately in the short tube to newing into new um to new freedom camping problems as they emerge down cider that I didn 't mention was the first option case by case basis is that of course there is the risk that you may be moving people from one place to another yes so obviously these are a lot of work done over this summer around monitoring enforcement and in particular of course the monitoring officers have played a very successful role and the the educator in providing information they have also gathered a lot of data that helps us to come to the position where we can camping by law because there is quite a significant amount of data will be needed to be gathered you know probably as soon a done around some of the MPX both on the physical environment end on the social and demographic issues what its best of all and then get into the oxygen monitor is that okay yeah we got was there a question yeah ever thank you on page 445 in relation to the freedom camping actor talk about that the council wishes to make a vital it must meet one or more of the following purposes and so and then it goes so Roman numerals one two three my view is that actually those three have been met or criteria have been metal already in terms of justifying one in my experience would that be your understanding from the information you 'll receive at this point I would have to say that to a large extent the monitoring report indicates that years especially around health and safety of people when particularly access to the area I clearly had plenty of information over there yes thank you that 's question it 's really around are we doing is the more we can do to be proactive really in terms of just so that people are aware of where the facilities are but also the responsibilities that kind of thing I know that the enforcement team work hard on the other swimming is there another widest it could that be scoped and what more widely so we are currently we 're tapping into a number of sources about educating with the right kinds of places out of freedom camp and there 's a number of really predominant maps that are being accessed by freedom campers cost with one of the providers this morning and they have a huge number of huts 4,000 Hertz on there an app and a huge number has been downloaded to actually be able to inform you on where you are needing to friend Ken so there 's that educational level vo2 there 's a combined agency approach to sending the right messages for freedom camping across doc across High Street City Council and other agencies to which really talks about first and foremost go to freedom camp and then provide identifies areas through some of these X or our maps around where freedom camping can legitimately occur a lot of that is all steering people into legitimate camping ground areas but of course we know that there 's a preference is not to go there we 've got educational flyers that go out and they 've been handed out with every conversation that we have with a freedom camper on the ground so we are guys are out there doing that you 're giving that information up next one sort of supplementary question like it 's great that all that has been done and the information is there I 'm just wondering it do we say and I 'm aware that not all freedom campers for example use use rip private riddle in companies for their vehicles but would we also for example ensure that informations with regional vehicle companies great yeah thank you thank you I 've got Andrew then pulling thank you um option one is doing the same as we 've done this last summer I mean where I 'm coming from a bylaw but wanting to do more than we have done this summer is is there more resource that we could commit or more enforcement or more monitoring we could be doing and if we did would that from what you 've seen so far have a greater effect a kind of option 1 plus if you like yeah there 's always the potential for more resource to put into this I think with the under the main provisions of the freedom camping end of the 850 observations of fruit and campaign we haven 't actually observed anybody an appropriate toileting disposing of waste and appropriately all of the things that the communities are bringing up and that 's despite you know try being there in the morning or being there an evening to seed it so educating one thing I think it 's actually more around telling people and being very specific we 're self-contained camping needs to be where the prohibited areas are in our district really promoted areas are with particular conditions for self-contained and non self contained and freedom camping thank you and just one other have been 11 calls into the customer service error 11 requests for service that is a lot less than I would have expected given the number of calls emails contacts I 've had as an elected member and unaware that other elected members have had raising freedom camping issues so have you considered we talk about education for campers but is the consideration of education for residents around what they should do if they find what they consider to be inappropriate freedom camping going on and has consideration been given to something like for example a a hotline or a specific resource to deal with those complaints as they come in so that people are more aware of what they need to do to lodge a complaint and how that complaint would be dealt with once it came in I think it 's a great idea and we can certainly take that in figured out of community it 's definitely at the moment it 's through the call center but we obviously received a lot of emails directly and to the unit and we more often than not trying to 's a great idea and will do that for example yeah we could add to option one you could add developer communications playing a much more wider focused communication screen yeah and that 's around how we deal with the campus but it 's also about how we communicate with residents about what they should do if they encounter a situation they not comfortable with bearing in mind a lot of freedom camping that occurs is it actually really legitimate when you look at their various regulatory mechanisms in place they 're actually legitimately came think it 's just their perception of letter in rubbish and whether it 's being deposited and what the multi-million dollar question about where are these people toileting if the facilities are closed overnight so yeah absolutely i think got a really good flavor from the complaints that we hear head around the effect that it 's having on local communities thanks pulling i mean when you it is a broad spectrum and i think one of the deputation to hear this morning was focused around you right and central and is it up on and my question is on page 44 for we 've already got it can 5.6 the traffic and parking by you tonight is it must be easier to a mean by law there to create anyone yes yeah so what did be an opportunity to perhaps work on this so that we you 've got this illegal for a that camper van to being parked in one place for more than seven days I mean perhaps that could be amended to reduce that time I don 't know just ideas that perhaps you staff would possibly come up with something but would that be feasible even you to perhaps go down yes and when was the park traffic parking alas termine de huelva study has been done earlier in the year that done amendment you can do minor at the entire time so I 'm just wondering if we want to perhaps look at mr. Ballard 's here and in looking at using that as at all together with educating people on what they can do if they see persistent parking for a long time in one place we they sorry turned a minute thank you I 'm really interested to hear from the information that you got from me you 're monitoring it there is no evidence of toileting at citrus I really interested in it they the other one is and the 4,000 hits on that on the air I mean these people are visitors to our city and we do need that these visitors we do need them to spend money here to help the local economies not just in the usual to tourist trips but Anne Brighton if the idea they can go shopping the local shops etc there 's a depth no question about how you managed it to perhaps kind of cure that where we allow them to do that if we say we 're they kind of freedom mascara for living facilities of things like that because it seems that you 're not finding evidence of that type of thing happening then is it a perception or is it just that we 're not playing it all up no when I say we 're not catching people in the act I 'm corner or toileting and curing not in the usual places but you know that 's always been the challengers catching that that person undertaking it activity at their time so yeah so you know there 's obviously preferable that be disposing of waste and the right kinds of places like toilets so if they were camping in a facility that does not have a toilet it seems ridiculous that we will allow it because it 's the odds are they will do toileting and even washing dishes or brushing teeth as we did these are things that we could be concerned about surely yes let 's speak to those basics water toilets yeah yeah and being in mind to know that if you look at some of the other by Wars or tools that when use my other territory they distinguish between self contained in non self contained you know so in self contained as a prescribed under a standard it requires that you have to have three days with of water on board you 've got to have your toilets down you 've got a waste facility on board that the bylaws and I had a really good review of a number of them that protect you in the coastal local authorities because it 's kind of what 's happening here it 's like it 's a coastal situation be at akkad or bent down you brighten or at summer they have lots of different kinds of conditions and options around how people go about freedom camping in a self-contained situation or a non self contained situation he thinks I 've got rare thing clean you think option one is going to be strong enough to deter freedom camping now let me add to that I mean I just don 't think we 're being clear enough with people that freedom camping is not tolerated within the city and I don 't know if we 're getting that message out because I mean the way social media works these days once people have come to something everyone knows about it a bylaw is much more specific it is very clear for everyone it provides it clarity its specific legislation geared up exactly to deal with freedom camping where is the are we doing with the rental companies that are hiring non-compliant vans so non-compliant venzas and sam self-contained it 's not sailfin tang yeah I mean it doesn 't mean that they 're not non-compliant is just that the renting out a vehicle that I am hasn 't got a self-contained facility in it so we again we can push more of the education through there and also target them the freedom camping profile which isn 't so we 're getting the right messages out to the right groups of people that are doing it but at the end of the day we put a consumer choice to make with a day tour New Zealand and a self-contained your non self-contained vehicle so we can certainly help be a are we doing that strongly enough oh I 've been pointing out a little yeah leaflets it 's actually been very clear that actually this is prohibited here well at the moment it 's not prohibited here anywhere and your district yeah and that 's where I think from a real ettore perspective a specific bowl or to manage prohibited area actually said that these particular park areas these particular are reserved areas these particular roads freedom can be similar to cure on how we wear theirs and other parts we have freedom camping can occur under particular sets of circumstances in that 's how it 's been managed and it gives a very clear direction the difficulty sometimes with the likes of using our existing bylaws so parks and reserves in traffic by others it 's a quest as a classic example up at y mari superclub actually half the car park without freedom camping the parks and reserves by law applies in the other half as the traffic viol one so but to i can schemers to a resident that looks like a car crack smells like a car park is a car fact they don 't understand the underlying rule so that we 're a Bible it 's specifically tailored and their way would help yeah okay I 've got gloom than Jimmy are these still questions you say oh yeah okay just one friend from your your team 's perspective and in terms of compliance what would on the ground more specifically direct people to the places with freedom campaign Sylvia keyring I think so at the moment we 're in a bit of and it 's difficult it 's like moving all those people from Beresford street saying you can 't go here this is not the right place for doing it and then we find it we 've just that 's just populated up and y Mari we could go out to y Mari and say don 't Park here go somewhere else and they 'll go and find another local community that 's what 's really difficult at the moment is actually saying well here it could be that the more obvious or prohibited places or prescribed places for that there 's also the opportunity for our third parties to come into the market too so there 's actual market interest and actually providing and mesh for freedom camping this kind of activity that 's a camping ground type environment but it 's a different a new way of camping grounds and Christ juice so there 's also pushing them into those places the popping up somewhere somewhere else more yeah and it 's when they start congregating you know you can see pockets of two or three that 's when it starts getting congregating in the power of social media it 's really hard to move it along yeah okay Jimmy sure because the you will review your information on page 4 55 you already have proposed a feed and camping no timetable in here and also that you replace some fellow cancers you know the steps new battles more kind of specific more dealing with this the kind of issue more effective so what 's your reason they 're still recommend the option wife rather than the option to to establish the new dialogue the reason for recommending option one is because it had been very successful over the summer in terms of being able to address the issues as they emerged on a case-by-case basis there are some you know freedom camping by allure isn 't going to solve every problem in it will create you know issues around having to we 're still have to do just as much work with new issues as they mujh because we haven 't caught them within the bylaw I mean we 'll have been the Bible over time of course but you want to be able to respond quickly which is what option one gives you that flexibility to do there are pluses and minuses for both okay sick second question there quickly okay okay but based on the estimate cost option one you you have a specified on 450 for the old co in the coast part-time nurse start for money to a program is rachels thirty one thousand dollars and the price of lumps under two thousand dollars for the sanity sh 0 but how about option two lovely estimator how much a polar consultation for the is kind of here in sh 0 as roughly roughly roughly roughly 50 to 60 perhaps in that region very roughly i 'm trying to depend on just how much policy it 's quite a policy and rich by law to develop and we might you might want to do quite a lot of connecting and with different counselors and community boards clearly who a lot of we want to want to do a lot of surveying and research to establish issues around the ability of the environment to cope we 're the best sites we shouldn 't happen so the Cooperative Research diva graphics of our freedom campus so it could go higher than it I wouldn 't be surprised actually okay thank you I just want to follow up on Pauline 's Christian rien debts around like if we were to amend their current bylaws would that practice fear give us breathing space and would but there would that I guess you utilizing knowledge and experience from other councils would that be enough at the stage I 'm not sure look I didn 't even hadn 't even occurred to me to do that I 'm i was looking specifically at other cat TI so I 'm dealing with freedom camping in what I was specific vile Isaac Borden and we would have to lock it how we could mime India traffic and parking viola to manage freedom campaign you 're going to be faced with the same sorts of challenges we freedom camping and bring those will but all those sorts of things through and managed it but it still I don 't know mrs. I don 't know whether there it would mean that we would be looking at putting prohibited areas and or restricted areas and as well which are provided for and the freedom keeping it as part of the bile or so yeah sorry sorry your option one is really partly also like exploring more you know trying to explore what more we could do around using the existing yes and in reporting back on there whereas option to was freedom camping by law and in reporting back on beach this and how you 've spent your summer would you actually favored a bylaw actually I would yeah and do it I just think it helps the policing is really interesting because it 's like that 's early it 's evening in early morning where you 've gotta capture it like that but one of the best ways to do it is actually for people freedom campers to actually known as understand what they can and can _''_1415.81 Bible its education in itself yeah yeah I I think um we 've got lots of Bibles and sometimes it 's quite hard to enforce Bibles and you have to go through a whole whole process so if you want to change behavior I really question whether or boiler what actually changed the behavior but accepting that you know that 's the advice that we 've been given i also want to light in terms of the park rangers whether we 've got adequate staffing levels and if we thought as a kind of interim solution between now and when the Bible comes in whether we 're better to actually put that resource into the park rangers who I found do a fantastic job already but I know have you know an increasing role to play in sort of education and awareness so you know is that if we gave you you know more if tes would that be something that would be useful in terms of that reassurance to the community catching people when they you know as we see on 528 we do have tools to get people because we get yeah can I the fifth inning k talk so that 's the beauty of the freedom camping in a bylaw there is an the substantive piece of legislation does provide an infringement regime which is not what we seen other out other bylaws which are fall back onto the local government which doesn 't have an infringement regime the other thing is there 's a lot more wider powers under the freedom camping it and in part of under the duty of an authorised officer that can require people to move on it can require people to provide you know their names and addresses and all that sort or personal information to be able to better manage freedom camping and educating that way I 'm not at all proposing that we use the stick approach and started swimming everybody with freedom camping because I think education is the right thing to do first and then assist in a direct people into the right places to freedom camp but that 's the beauty of the spy work or a bylaw that we can bring some of those things Park Rangers do Yanni but the duty for us as the park rangers mainly work on parks and reserves which are covered by the parks and reserves by law and for freedom camping that is currently quite well controlled which is quite different from what Ian 's team has been working on which has the areas on the roads and the streets which was it 's not covered so the park rangers don 't usually enforce on the road in the street as opposed to in the park Jen go for it when you say point them to the correct places to freedom King where are they at the moment fish and primo sanitizers go to a camping ground in dune it and then if you get onto the double provide education around the particular freedom camping eps and things like that we 're all very well it 's very easy through social media to find out where the free sites are the closest free site and christchurch is actually closed board and you 'll find that co sport is very popular for freedom camping that highlights all the camping it also directs people in that way bearing in mind the freedom camping allows freedom camping to occur anywhere unless it 's prohibited or restricted and a local government area and and also and dock land as well so doc also has a role to play around providing those kinds of campsites and what 's wrong with the approach of just putting up no freedom camping in specific sites so that new brighton in that parking place with a going put one deal what why what sort of it 's been doing that and end and a by you I mean a bylaw seems to be a very big overarching thing which might my view probably not necessary when you can use signs and specific areas so that the signs and the Beresford street car park is quite a different scenario from a park or a reserved its it was actually cancelled lend from a title piece of land and counsel invoked at some role as a property owner as opposed to a private public property owner show light rides and parks and reserves fro putting signs up everywhere in want signs everywhere around for our packs and reserves around we 're camping connect xbox yeah pattern don 't we just have hot spots trouble trouble spot they move like these hot spots move and I move really quickly yeah and it 's what 's happening now yeah _"

    "text": "do we have staff to speak to this if you 'd like to come from table please mr. chira is that going to be do you think we going to be able to do that one or 15 minutes I 'd like to think we can do it reasonably quickly the way that I 'd like to run this is if staff have got any comment maybe we 'll hear from staff first my understanding is that counselor skander it 's then going to speak from the hearings panel and then if we 've got any questions we can put those then they 'll be any debate will make a decision I intend to move this on reasonably quickly are there any comments the staff wanted to make on the report first of all but no counselor Turner would like cut Tim to proceed if possible okay counselor skander 's is it very real thing thank you John I don 't they just a wee bit of background it 's all in the report but I 'll be very quick the hearings pen was made up of cheered by IBM Chi and David east Johnny Hanson and myself I do want to commend staff I thought it was in a very robust process just to give you a wee bit of background the submission process was open for two months and included a number of public drop in meetings notification was via radio newspaper and Facebook there are meetings door knocking delivery of the proposals to the surrounding streets and a liter drop within a 2k radius of the park so there was a robust and privacies without question through that we got a total of six hundred and eighty five submissions we received we heard 23 of them but from those 685 submissions because a number of them hit people voting am signing petitions there were just under 4090 signatures or actual connection with this process so I think again there does it outstanding and in 3.2 you can see the feedback was very very positive a number of things were raised through the hearings process a number issues which were terrific legal issues parking benefits air to the community etc I think through this process you always learn time endangered frogs and excuse my lettin but as the Torah rain for rain formas fries so the important thing following from that was it was twofold one was that how important the age of 19 away the proposal is to the local community and to keep those trees and that boundary for recreational use and a buffer zone if you like and the other important thing was it must be and I 've lost my place but there must be a terrific and correct me if I 'm wrong with my termination my tunes I see further traffic assessments that Sedra done prior to anything happening and I know that staff are working with a cane with regards to buses etc so all in all there was a unanimous decision by the panel and again I think staff and all those submitters who presented and took part in it thank you thank you are there any questions Phil first of all I just have a question in a coming but my question really is given given how well the consultation wind is there a way that that the residents that information would keep going to them I think we 've seen so far the advantages of keeping as many people particularly local residents informed so yes there is the regular information sessions the where decisions have to be made the involvement of the local community I think on this one experience has shown that we need to be we need to continue to be proactive and we will own to do some like to be that further question film okay welcome to comment in a moment clin thank you your notice is a submission from the New Brighton art vs Association just ask the Tina object submission yet it was it was positive they are the the need for a permanent all-weather track was highlighted difficulties in accessing the nearest track at timaru were highlighted and the impacts on families I think there was also an expression there that please don 't stop maintaining the grass facilities that we have out in the east and our partnerships with various schools because they are still necessary for today happy or give the blessing to this proceeding it you know why so can we have a mover and seconder for this Tim will move Phil a second so we move now into debate Phil well I don 't have it sorry a debate but just it just look at the main thing I want to do as reiterate what Tim said in terms of thinking staff and also the counselors who set on their hearings panel and was a lot of work went into that and I 'm just really repped it does border our spray booth get area but it 's more than that because this is this is a wonderful combined sports facility area for you know a range of sports so we 've got athletics hockey and antennas or able to use these grounds and I just think in terms of where air city is at now this is really timely in terms of a future transformation for for Christchurch as we know that really includes kids and adults and sporting activities I 'm particularly impressed with how the special concert of process we consultation of process wind and I think that 's really important that we as 's a good example of when we got the process right in fact we 're going to get a really good outcome so I think that all together you know the way the submissions we into there was a ninety percent rounds of ninety percent support for the future complex speaks for itself so my own in a word well done Paul and just endorse everything you just said in feel but also coordinating these sports codes investment into this this area here is also really really important so that 's just not the council will got other sports code you know and be some little amounts of money into this here which i think is really great this one I think the staff is woman Yanni thank you as hearing panel member just wish to speak in support of the current panel recommendation but it 's one of my few key points that I think do need to be raised the first point and you know under 8.2 we acknowledge the importance of Christchurch and Canterbury of the amv show and its desire to work for council to work the continued success and long-term viability of the event so certainly there was some submissions through this process that buttered this against the show actually where the hearings panel got to was we 're really keen to work together with everyone who 's involved and has an interest around this site to make sure that we get the best use of of the land and also enable those other objectives to be met so I just think it 's really important to highlight that we certainly acknowledge and in no way as are these recommendations trying to disrupt or reduce the ability for the AMC show to continue and continue to be a success I want to just touch on the point that we heard from a lot of submitters we did hear from people in the eastern so it was particularly delivered community Pegasus community board he did make the case that they felt that there was nothing happening in the award and we 're concerned about this development I think we do have to just point out that actually a lot has been committed to in terms of jump we 've got the investment and Rafferty domain we 've got that new era nary community center so there have been things that have been done to deal with some of the quite issues and of course the eastern aquatic facility and recreation center that we we discussed earlier today but there wasn 't concerned that Rafferty wasn 't being maintained as good as it could in terms of a temporary athletics facility and so the penalty has asked that that gets looked at so that we get some good irrigation and some bit of maintenance of of that facility but probably one of the most powerful arguments in support of us agreeing to proceed with us was the huge impact that for lack of sport and recreational facilities in our city post-earthquake had had on actually the children of the city and their families that length of distance that they had to travel just was something that was raised repeatedly around how difficult and expensive it was fool them to perform it to the best of their abilities and so I think that point I sends a strong our children and also actually also masters athletes who give a lot back to our community but also came to the hearing to say that you know they saw this has been really important and you know as it 's been said on many things post-earthquake for the older generations actually they don 't have the benefit in luxury of time that many of us younger people have and so for them to see progress within the next few years is actually really important and that came through pretty pretty powerfully through the hearings panel that that people wanted to see this in a very good time frame so we 're not talking about building a hugely expensive facility in the short term what we 're talking about is doing the things we need to do you replace what we 've lost and then build on that over time in the medium to long term so I just want to make that point as well that we 're doing what we can afford to do here to replace the really urgent facilities like athletics like the hockey to as possibly not building a lot of the auxiliary facilities that go around that until later on when when it 's more financially feasible to do so so I think you just staff into all the submitters from the different points of view that they gave I think it was a good process and irie endorsed the comment that was made that actually having hearings actually you get a lot better outcomes and I you know not a note through this process the ability for elected members to drill down onto concerns and try and address those three resolutions is incredibly powerful and I think we should continue to support that sort of process for these significant projects Thank You Jimmy yeah I saw one of a hearing pender like a tender he mentioned earlier I personal still went to hold of places we read up all the retailer 's a mission and also we heard all those the twenties wheel over the submission and also the in order we have a kind of expensive that the liberation regarding to a few of our summation party concerned and also timid a mention order regarding to the traffic park in this kind of issue because based on all the abrasion we suggest have any development would require for traffic integration assessment so I have a strong feeling there a chili 's majority of the people these people consists of the community individual residents and also the key stakeholders especially those those sports the grouper carp or even individual suppose person a severe injuries fully supportive about how to remediate this tangle of the maybe few but your concern from the also meters I think we have a very good as the the recommendation reflect to the the spatial either here in penetrate with the recommendation in here so I do appreciate the staff is because while they take the already taken comprehensive scientific investigation from the city why 45 you know possible location then reveal each one of them are surely is the fall and the Nepal are wise 10 for securities so I think in the initial stage start on the equator Jack you know so Harry pendel is wider you animist to support than a pull away at the unique kind so i asked each that all our fellow councillor feliz apologies here in panel recommendation thank you claim Thank You mr. me sorry chief the you know a thing oh right that 's right nearly no just I still have lingering questions over the land which I have put in the past given that it 's TC 2 and 3 out there which in the beginning was part of the rest not having an athletics track Beckett back in the east so I 'm quite surprised still that this is cut this far Ahmet respect but I can see the data there by the submissions and the hearings panel happy to support my colleagues and that no question there yeah i think there 's quite a strong mandate to proceed with us and we need to it 's really important I also urge you though to still keep one eye on the track at our feet and to keep that after the screech as well great so I 'm also happy to support the recommendations from the hearings panel this represents another important step on the way to establishing this the recovery of sports in our city i 'd also like to add to the acknowledgement and congratulations of the staff involved the hearings panel and also all of the people that submitted and we were part of this process obviously it 's run very well and it 's um seemed to be a very successful process so i put the motion all in favor against as carried so will now break for lunch half an hour so that would see us back here at one o 'clock _"

    "text": "it 's the remover does anybody want to move it Jamiel move seemed it Tim okay I suspected as some questions and things are they yep Ellie go for it all right first one hi I wanted to know on 2.3 so page 415 there 's mention of the 2014 new zealand ice fest the 16 days of program the unique visits the percentage of satisfaction etc where in this report is there any information on the economic benefit to the to the region and perhaps more specifically back to the council when the paper was written we were still waiting for the final documentation to come from our evaluation company I can provide those figures separately because that 's actually key as far as I 'm concerned so I die I would have suggested the report not even be produced without that but if we could have that ASAP that will be great about that thank you I also had a question on 5.1 page 20 page 418 council provides 250,000 operating budget so that 's 500 per festival of course because its biannual the 1.5 million operating budget outside of council that that council facilitates the finding of not funding directly from councillors that 's what it is okay thank you very much and in the recommendation 6.2 that the revised governance group being tasked with identifying additional funding that is that 1.5 million that you mentioned that 's fine thank you thank you two questions if I can on 5.1 just a point of clarification we 've got the 250,000 operating budget around which is obviously 500,000 per festival the 1.5 million that 's referred to in line two is that 1.5 million per annum or 1.5 million festival purpose that 's Perfessor vol okay great and then just a point of clarification on page 418 of the agenda for point for the 2014 festival had a management of 4.5 FTE and then we 've got 1.5 permanent staff allocation going up to 6ft e to effectively deliver the festival presumably the 6ft a and not permanent they 're just for the festival duration that 's correct we use a mixture of fixed termers and freelancers and the main reason that I take from the report for sponsors that are the funders that we would expect to fund the additional 1.5 million if I 'm reading that correctly it 's correct yes thank you which is four pointed to the second align they are currently as probably other opportunity for support within other mb department they who they are is as Fister group for all is the central garner or who else well we were supported for two years by major events New Zealand it 's a they don 't tend to fund over the long term but they 've agreed to work with us to identify other sources of funding from within government for 4.3 regarding the key stakeholders now also the you particular mention a six-pounder one like a government school established by here I didn 't see any the central Carmen of central comm agency partake of like a university Canterbury in tactica CIA or the comdata but why no central government agency when we were working with major events news and they chose to be on our leverage and legacy committee rather than on the governance group they they felt that was the government departments that 's involved in funding major events New Zealand then there would be a discussion about whether it 's relevant or not for them to be on the governance group but do you have confidence you know to feel the gape of the 400 k well we would look at it much more broadly than that and look at sponsorship and contributions from our core partners or strategic partners as well Thank You Mia that we have is very strange process and we have to I won 't go to be gone for ten minutes we have to call for nominations and all sorts of stuff could I just nominate that since the schools and next one possibly the next run a kind of Andrews area that Andrew take the chair for 10 minutes said okay thank you so if you would do that Andrew and continue on this one might also suggest that that might be since it 's going to be later than 12 that there may be a good time to take a lunch break after after we deal with nappeun away man if you lot meeting so I 'm having how long you want to take a look how long do for lunch I 'm thinking 30 minutes that lady handle no half an hour please yes okay we got any further questions 10 I 'm thank you I realize that I 'm we were promoting to go over to Antarctica teacher but at the moment with on 5.2 we 're looking at I 'm sorry 5.1 looking at increase of 250,000 on the previous festivals other previous festivals on page 41 73 teen basically though the the budgets at 125 for 1 million two hundred fifty four thousand and this is effective delivery the festival on 5.1 there 's 1.5 this would be to cover necessary extra staffing but the question was we are looking at an increase of quarter of a million dollars for the next feast of all if the proposal goes forward that 's a target if necessary it would be delivered at less than that but that 's a realistic target what took 24 is from get hit um so let 's regard it so we 're looking at this festival so that four hundred thousand days supply may not be here for the future that 's that 's that 's a possibility yes so with us supply 500,000 and we 're looking at a million dollars of sponsorship how does the christchurch sponsorship market look at supporting it in your opinion at the moment we 're undergoing a strategic review of the festival and of what commercial opportunities are out there we i think last time and is about 600,000 in terms of media contra and others so we do have quite a way to go but that 's why we 're undertaking a strategic review right now okay thank you any further questions Glenn thank you what struck me about the report was that the leap from one a half full time equivalents to six so can you just go into that a bit more well the 1.5 is what 's allocated from within the permanent staff that alone is not what was delivering this the festival last time around we did a calculation it was 1.5 but even that was very pushed we need an additional 's that 's it being really realistic about what the festival is to deliver it properly what it needs in terms of FTE yani i just i know we 've previously discussed it but we need a sponsorship manager within council that can do these external requests and it 's much wider than just the specific event so I do wonder whether you know with it has this been to the events and festivals working party yeah yeah but is it I 'm just kind of like when is that person kind of starting is there but rather than increasing this budget is it funded out of another line item in a draft program so the regards to an ETA for a sponsorship manager that 's underway at the moment we 're waiting for we 're just finalizing the the PD in regarding and then since you 've all web ties within the next month for that for that position and it 's the cover not just ice fest but council events all right thank you I 'm Timmy you had a forgot yeah Tim you have a question this the developer Bongo small scale events would they be covered under the same umbrella of them the one budget yes okay thank you and Ally he did 1.5 ft is for that 's our permanent allocation right now yeah but you actually ended up having 4.5 didn 't you and what you 're wanting now is I had the figure out prosthetics yes but we 're looking at a full staffing and some of it might come from you know another post within Council or somebody that 's fine i just said was the one I think you may see what was it was 1.5 we are five for the pro point five wasn 't sufficient so this has been moved and seconded is there any debate Ali thank you um I have to say I mean I love a good festival and I think we do some very very well here in Christchurch I think that we need pistols for people who live here and people who visit here i am not completely sold on ice fest I had to say and I think there are clearly some issues of the festival the information inclusion the report is useful and enter interesting but I cannot vote for any of the staff recommendation without the information relating to the economic benefit to the region and particularly looking at the money little council has been to money that has come back into the council and so look I don 't know whether I can put an amendment in there but I really would like to suggest that we defer this until we actually get more information we I mean you you could move an amendment and if its second did it can be debated so have you got some wording for an amendment that you 'd like to move would there be a second assassin amendment yep so if we can get some text up for that place given up into pistol working party but but we do have one and so surely the appropriate thing would be for that like a bit of a debrief the economic information to go to that working party and then to make recommendations to you that would seem to be a good way forward that to be to form part of your amendment so that if this information goes to the events and festivals working party and then the maybe by way of a chairs report from the events and festivals working party that could come back to the council film yes I think we should just present just proceed with these recommendations if there 's lots of things where we could ask for a cost-benefit analysis and it may be justified but it you know it should certainly go to the working party first so I 'm prepared to support the staff recommendations as they are pulling all support the amendment noting that and 6.3 we 've got a six-month reporting back time so it doesn 't seem to be a huge urgency so I 'd support the amendment to go through first and then we 'll come back anyway okay seeing as I 've move with some tongue sequined it oh I don 't know if the second day sees there 's any middle ground there but the amendment seems really logical in the first instance and then perhaps the Working Party it 's just that the working party becomes the governance group they speak of so why don 't we just incorporate the two they don 't mean we become a substantive and we just replace government 's group with what do they call it the events and festivals working party is that a sensible way for audible it 's the economic benefit comes out there 's a negative or not not good enough seen they might be completely different decision it 's the nothing that 's why L he 's calling for me personally so just taking stock of where we 're at we 've got we 'll just complete the text of this amendment and then Paul you with second it won 't you so if we can note councillor lonsdale a seconder for you mr. Chito I just want I don 't want to create any more work so can we just clarify that I 'm not suggesting that a new full report be prepared but basically the report that we have got include information on the economic very benefit so i Donna split hairs be added to report that information on economic benefits of the festival be added to the report that information on economic benefits be added to the report does that make sense no so the sentence starts that information on economic benefit so after the word that I first word after the first word that yes sorry so that information on economic benefits be added to the existing report dated 12th of the third or whatever and we present yo yo yo so if the amendment were to be carried and I 'm just checking in here if this amendment were to be carried that would then see this report debated at a further council meeting once this further information was available via the events and festivals working group is there any further debate on the amendment Jamie well it 's more of a clarification they 're just so I 'm really clear on what you were trying to ascertain is the question is you 're not convinced that there is sufficient it can only benefit to the community and that 's what you 're asking is fleshed out is that is that the what I go I guess it is to buy now then if you knew yeah for all I 'm saying here enough something convinced me otherwise you know that 's fine but in the report I see it we 've got ninety one thousand visitors as a result of this 59.6 thousand unique visitors as from the last of India was effectively cost neutral if we can retain it as cost neutral in the governance working party of the events and festivals working party can find a way to ensure that it is cost neutral bring in ninety thousand people for a for a good event I don 't really have a problem with it I don 't see why we hold it up if it can continue to be cost-neutral early yet certainly all right the point is that there are too many assumptions and the information that 's in there Jamie for me it 's all very well and good or good and well instead 90 or thousand people in there but are those local people are they from overseas are they staying and I know these are the extra flow of money through the through the city like anything we there is a large investment there needs to be more information I don 't want to make assumptions thank you Tim as I said she 's going to follow on familiar that we just need one breakdown and information and also through the events and festivals working party we can also ask and get some detail on the sponsorship because we do have tips and assumptions ever be based on fact and so the same regards to the visitor numbers 91,000 it 's a hell of a lot of people going to a festival what 's the sentence of locals those visitors because we are down on our bed nights etc etc so we threw this through this working party we can gain their information is there a possibility mr. chair then because that sounds sensible Tim and I actually move the substantive there but it sounds like a sensible approach or a sensible step so we can have a bitter outcome as a result it as their weight wouldn 't just incorporate that into one resolution I think as we 've already clarified would have the effect of leaving this report lie on table until such time as the events and festivals working party had had their and had their meeting point it 's no point in doing the other stuff if that stuff doesn 't pan out yeah yeah where if the amendments carried then we can 't agree to the substantive until we 've got the further information back from the working party okay was there anybody else wanting to speak to this ok so I 'll put the amendment all in favor against so that 's carried so that has the effect of referring this to the events and festivals working passing and it 'll come back to council with a recommendation thank you also the amendment now needs to be put as the substantive motion so all in favor against as carried moving on to the next item item 26 now poo noir _"

    "text": "on your agenda Oh welcome thank you so page 73 so we have a couple of parties the first one is pretty straight forward I 'm sure you agree the board recommends to counsel that includes in the public notification of counsel and community board meetings are welcome to the public to attend with phone contact details to arrange speaking rights are all meeting so notified so at the moment is just a general number and and it 's not very that 's not very welcoming I think we want to be encouraging easy sorry this one there in the public notification of council and community board meetings is a welcome for the public to attend with phone contact detail one place to go to get the contact I I think personally I think that the each community board advisor should have should have the number under each of the community board meetings yep you just want to say I 'm instead of phone phone contact he was just contact details because I think an email would be like make sense a lot of people as well yep full know turn signal put that those in favor please say aye those opposed Kerry dapat be put that move full seeking did turn that those in favor please say aye those opposed to carry did I get you guys to move the report as a whole if I didn 't it was Scandrick and tech clearwater that the reporters a whole we doctored those in favor say aye those opposed carried your next one oh yes the next one on page 79 with couple of matters to first winners operation redundant property on one Carlisle streak so as part of the sudden the master plan this is scheduled to be disposed off is in kind of a land swap and land at 441 Colombo street has been purchased the board is concerned that the Saline should be used in a way that 's consistent with the master plan but you know I sort of after some offline discussion I think that you know a purpose if this link could be used for a purpose that enhance the master planner and I 'll turned up it was rather than just disposing of of entrance from the north end to end acidnam so it 's I yeah I don 't think it would be good to have some alternatives considered with it with that in mind we should make an amendment I thank to this and i agree i think it I think the we can get better then just what is in the I think the community board when they consider this and I was there in fact it was sort of like how do we mitigate this issue of you know the interrupt the entrance to certain them so that in fact it does look good and as part of a certain master plan given and the given though was that the the property be sold and I think what would be helpful though is if some other alternatives as the hell we could use this very small piece of land if in fact they were carefully considered and my suggestion would be that the community board reconsider them so I 'd propose an amendment their way he could have had fanfare well you know i 'll move it um that alternate or including alternative use of the of the property and so the it is like an the entrance to send them but it 's hidden by the bridge is tucked underneath to the corner of the bridge oh that 's really not cool where she a strategic piece of land I question whether one of the big pieces of information that 's missing from this whole debate and I 'm not intending getting into a conversation right now I think it 's a conversation for the board and that 's why I 'll be supporting the amendment around what the the strategic use of the land might be where it might fit with the Sidon and master plan but I do think the piece of information that 's missing at this particular time is a valuation of the property because of course one of the questions has got to be the dollar value of this versus the strategic value of it now I 'm hoping the community board will come up with a strategic fit for the master plan that will have greater social and strategic value than the to have that valuation in order to be able to inform that discussion the suggestion is to send it back to the community board but we have a technical kitchen that you 've moved the motion so you can 't move an amendment now you 've both moved and seconded so I just need somebody else to do you want to move the amendment Andrew I 'd be happy to move that yep as there a seconder for the amendment yani okay thank you guys yep is there any other boat quite quickly Yanni and then I 'll get a comment even though I shouldn 't the time may become an issue but it seems to me that there could be some team free users of the site while some them redevelops so I think selling it off now is premature and that 's why I 'm supporting having a lot what can be done in the short term I would appreciate it if the council would direct staff to provide advice on possible alternatives to well if you I would it would be quicker if it was included in think it 's important that the correct staff advice is there there 's no question about that so there needs to be staff advice and support and I mean I 'm suggesting that a land valuation is a part of that but also I think it 's important when we 're saying an alternative use of the property that that alternative use is in alignment with the outcomes expected from the Signum master plan so it needs to be aligned with the signal master plan can I just suggest that we add at the end with the appropriate staff advice okay okay can I put it now you 've spoken to the motion and the amendment that 's better be good because it 's creaking all the rules thank you very much look I 'm Paul Mitchell it 's a funny bill aimed at the bottom bother by the the bridge and in the report 3.11 and 3.12 actually supports that but it is absolutely so important to this business community look at the other four corners of this business community and the south end we 've got the remains that has been here for too long and at the other end we had the wonderful demolition site for too long which should never have been allowed to happen so every little bit is so important to this community and we 've got to give it respect with especially with what three point one point to the easements across the land do detract from its value but if council staff through their process can renegotiate those to make this piece of land more valuable to a proposed buyer who will add value to one of the corners of this community we absolutely fantastic thank you those in favor please say aye those opposed it becomes the motion those in favor please say aye that supposed carried thank you item number two renaming they 're beautifully named khulus drainage reserve I don 't think there 's any debate on that plus the staff recommendation but one two arms yeah start to approach my Tahoe about having a name that 's better than coolest dream right this is not a high benchmark right so i 'll put that those in favor please things would fill and Part B is moved by full sequel to Tim and no debate I put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carries what have I 've got yeah we did we had fell in turn but we just weren 't keeping up yep item C move boasting the term of pop met those in favor say aye those

and make sense just to exhaust the remainder of that fund the reason why the social housing heat pumps didn 't go on is because it financially did not stack up this has proved to help the commercial viability to help with increased portable housing inside the 4 airs so it 's getting the ball rolling for an outcome that we desperately need and it 's been successful as an Australian the report and exhausting sense it 's not well it 's just enters the fact what I agree with the seat I 'm going to support the the recommendation here however in terms of the sentiments that Jonnie was expressing he 's absolutely right that in fact that this is council assistance in my view it is it is a good investment however it just needs to be clear that there is no ratepayer assistance for for city housing so that 's the point that Jonnie was making I certainly agree with sentiments even I 'm going to vote for the the recommendation falling I agree with yanni I think that it was put in place with the time frame for Jamie 's commenters four hundred thousand dollars left it 's still a considerable amount of money and I will be voting against er no and you both want it recorded Pauline and Yanni okay item number three moved glean second le i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried item number four yep sure who you asking died do you want to come down here in cases let the railing damage to get to continue to occur and I 'm just concern as a we build gains momentum do we have advocate systems in place to ensure these large write-offs do not continue to increase that 's on the item two point two point three key point2 points of the corporate finance report your 320 so we had to get a write-off 151,000 be at a date compared to a t-1000 previous years so you can see the escalation of these write-offs increasing and I 'm just concerned as we gain momentum of the rebuild with us not going to continue to write off okay if i can say i don 't think it 's so much a wallet certainly up here on years because a lot of very old debts have been tidied up this year unresolved and part of it was with a quite large owner pensioner housing and the like where there was some settlement around the round our own resource consent sweet issued so it 's not so much the positions getting worse it 's actually the position as improving and as part of very comfortable with what the dick Department of doing they 're really doing a very good job on that point I just wanted to highlight the living it 's just so I think counselors are clear and Arthur gasps this committee at a question of the committee but the deters and two point two point one although it 's a large amount of money that 's I that 's that 's normal practice that they 're not over June it 's just showing who knows that 's what money at a certain point of time and the expectation is that they will pay to an appropriate schedule is a group they do fluctuate depending on like a year in for example there always a lot higher because there 's a lot of invoicing goes out at year-end so no it 's not that the positions getting worse okay in under two point two three I 'm the idea that the contractor has caused damage to the road and then we write off that that did do we have sufficient bonds in place because it has been raised with me from of you know writing that gets destroyed when there 's a demolition or construction and it 's not necessary been placed and you know footpath cut downs that are no longer needed etc did I just wonder whether we need to think about some sort of bond so the companies if they go into liquidation or fall over they can 't run off without us getting the money that we need to fix what bubbly part of the improvement we 're doing is to increase those datos for which we do have bonds we have some concern with for example with the boom in the housing industry that we have bonds there to protect ourselves and I know there is a process for having bonds for normal contracting work it 's not necessary and for this contractor here he may not have been doing work for us he could have been doing something for someone else and just trundled off the road and damaged it but but yes it is it is an area that was being looked at and it was never bad but it 's been made better up to yarny but the damage to our roads any drive around you see it from the big trucks and what happens is they are obliged to repair any damage correct if it 's if it 's been yeah what they do is they hatch that part and that is not really bringing the road back to the way it was before and I think this is a big concern that we we could well be left with a legacy in that regard from from the rebuild and we need to be thinking about that in the inner city which is still being constructed as well before we look at putting new road in d Shirley I mean to bring a question how many of these damages are we actually billing for do you know I don 't know sorry but I wonder whether perhaps Jane if you 're able to speak to that I mean it wouldn 't be the contractor themselves that 's preparing the pothole we would surely engage one of our experience to do it on our behalf but I have to pass to my colleagues one otherwise I might advise you wrongly but I 'll find out the information I think it would be good information to have and as I said when they rip up the road they do make a pothole and that ends up getting pitched but it 's not like the road was before I 'd think of something we need to flip for this Jamie moves and full seconds put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried item five that earthquake clones updates information for you moved poor seconded turn that those in favor please say aye those opposed to carry item 6 and I 'm the review of the council Treasury 's risk management policy I noticed that CC HL now has an ethical investment policy so the things that it won 't invest in and I think it 's probably way past time that the council had one as well so I wonder if staff could report back I 'm not wanting to adopt one now but whether a future meeting of this committee whether they could be a debate on an ethical investment policy starting point is the one thats ECHL adopted in November sure okay thank you I 'll just trust for you to do that ok so the recommendations is there any problem put those

heaven and because it 's it will the consultation I think of something we need to be doing some work in the background I 'm sure yeah but I just want to raise it as a as a quite a major concern thank you I just wanted to thank you for the additional information around the water main breaks I know it 's it 's obviously quite concerning it has quite a detrimental impact on on the community in on the city particularly around that the breakages and the EMA disruption so I know that we 're going to further challenge Sarah position in the cost year agreement because the break rate on page 3 89 hasn 't improved and we 're only getting funding for exceptional cases I just wonder whether there 's anything more we need to do when you look at the graphs I mean it 's it 's really alarming you know that the breaks that we 're getting in our water mains now because Sarah as i understand it have stopped funding they were up here so i just wonder whether we can do any work to quantify what that cost us we can do with Sarah to try and convince them of the argument that it 's important that we keep fixing them I 'll have to come back on it those are hopeless AI those hosts carried item 8 the

    "text": "I think if Kerry made community board he 's two for three welcome thank you for being so patient that 's right been interesting listening to everyone else 's issues always is know what screaming everywhere and so we had one pate from the fourth of Hebrew that 's major Hornbrook road at Mount Pleasant school there 's a school patrol so this is an extension of the road safety program happening around the skull so late last year I think the council passed the slow speed zone at that point as well the mayor asked for some information on how to create slow speed zones and neighborhoods around the city and that was due to come back to the council early in the year and we haven 't seen it come back yet so if it could be chased up that would be really good excellent thank you so this one makes sense a school patrol and keep crossing and this will be a really good addition to the school safety program up around there so we 're recommending it 's a pate so yeah Paul seconded Yanni can favor please say aye as opposed to carried happy and see anything you might set these two things here and this is a really positive project of austin community library site and we had a workshop with Malenko matalavage recently with community board community and staff and looking at doing it and may have a transitional library on site even maybe get full of style 10 square meter laying in a green space and so we 're really looking for more community involvement in bringing on their project at the moment and the other one was I know counselors have recently received a letter from the Victoria Neighborhood Association and the board has been the exploiters issue as well the LA p the district licensing committee recently made a decision on the LED kitchens renewal of license end his put the his de food its decision for the 12 months and and things to continue and see the nub of the problem currently in that area is that the wake of a an LA p it 's easier and the draft la_._138.16 Paix which has been for public consultation the an area affected by noise nuisance and vandalism and a closing time of one am was recommended this doesn 't mean to say that the draft la fee will not change prior to coming into force Pat 's verte may that the final policy will reflect the desire of the community as a whole in this instance the delay in implementing the LA p is having a significant impact on this community and the board has and it 's addictive members again raised the issue and we would really like the council to start progressing this as soon as possible our communities really affected by on on top of the LA p or the lack of the LA p is the noise issues are sort of compounded by people parking out into the suburbs because they can 't get close here so they 're parking and all the streets are all the suburban areas and of course you can imagine after the finished drinking at three o 'clock of the morning one in back to the car being in the doors here in our conversations is that some of those the council needs to consider if they 're wanting 20,000 people to live in the inner city we need to ensure we maintain amenity for those people and I think it 's something we need to give some strong consideration to reconsidering our position on the LAPD what I just think as a council we need to stand up in this you put it line the scene because what you 've got happening is businesses getting licenses through two three o 'clock of the morning with an expectation that then that could continue infinitum an actual fact you know you might find that actually end up being a 1 a.m. sharp and we could in their cells and a bit of a problem with some of those businesses gin defer a discussion on Monday and decide where we 're going with it on it ok ok um I 've got Part B and C is there any debate on your veteran business not I put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and I 'm now on your next one on page 251 yeah we don 't interesting with we hit a deputation from Ulster castles castles Sons talking about his proposal for a new Victorian style footbridge over the river though the current road bridge is very unsafe for pedestrians and there 's a lot of issues there and he 's proposing a footbridge end sort of wharf it looks absolutely fantastic it is stunning even done we 're really come forward to they 're progressing with staff and they 're linking into the wider plan that counts resolved for that riverbank area earlier last year how do you any impediments to it happening I mean I agree with you completely it 's stunning and there any specific impediments at this stage but it 's just like it needs to Lincoln with that council resolved to get a plan go to start to work on a plan for that rug Bank area and it 'd be really good to work in conjunction with it it can also be working with the land drainage team this world because these plans for the hiss curtain that 's right i mean this cutting and they 're sort of thing reasonably soon was it be good to when we have it as information well certainly report back on it yeah they seem to pull part being seen sorry yonni it 's just very brief comment is two things of note from an advocacy role that the community board have taken up one is we have written to Prime Minister around the social Alvin changes particularly government setting off the state houses to community housing providers and also we did support the council 's position around the trans-pacific partnership agreement resolution and have undertaken to seek other

to this point we 've had a long keg process to determine the location I think that was confirmed by council kind of month or so ago so yeah the board are strong on let 's just get it happening let 's get get those mixed ages underway questions about the that were raised in the deputation so have you spoken to the CAG group at the board have there been involved well Robert came in over deputation at the last meeting which is mentioned here on page 207 the board the board to spend a while discussing the deputation and decided by a vote of six to one that we feel as though we felt as though the three child hadn 't been met for reconvening the keg that the the mandate that they were initially tasked with has been has been met and that the community board is where the decisions lie forward and in terms of some of the issues that they 've raised today about their making sure that the community has access to the pool during the daytime as well do you intend to meet with them about those sorts of operational yeah I think we haven 't this it at this point in time the threshold hasn 't been meat to meat specifically with the keg but I think that in the future that may occur once we get the more detailed design once we have talked to the Ministry of Education around the location of the schools in the pool then we 'll have a lot more information we can go back to the community and the cake because that 's our job as lead to members are still is to talk with the community so there 's definitely sorry you 're intending to do a great deal more of that oh yeah I know that that 's our job as elected members us to is to engage with the community in represent the community Tim Kate debate yep pulling this is a stupid one but it no the kid where a work they work because a lot of it was Peaks there was in our discussions around the location the members signed a confidentiality paper form at the start of the keg they were members of the community and they represented their groups and they could got they could feed they were feeders back to the groups that they represented so they were representing their groups when they 're in the kid but it was closed to general public I see that the eastern vision have recommended that keg be reconvened and ending with a facilitated engagement and that 's gone here so we 'll reconvene it will well IIIi don 't have a crystal ball but I imagine if there is if there is a threshold of where we need that expertise in the community advisor at the community advisory group or great they 've got a huge amount of knowledge and wealth and and experience and local knowledge on the area and on poles and I think we would as community board be be foolhardy to not continue discussions with them in the future their very knowledgeable people whether it 's in the form of the formal keg or whether it 's the in their personal you know and they 're back and their group within their group site I don 't know do you have any comments on the deputation that we hood and the concerns they have around perhaps demand if it 's if it 's own partnership with a school located with the school yeah I just kick it kick have any concerns about i think that the keg have articulated the concerns very well to the community board at the moment the discussions with we haven 't the council haven 't passed a resolution for the moa to have discussions with the council about where it 's going to go so until they do that we can actually have those discussions I believe it 's coming soonish to to the council to that so until the ministry in the in the council can actually start having those discussions we can 't have discussions with the community about it because we don 't know probably yeah i but i don 't the impression until you guys have been have formally see that we can engage with the moa we we can 't really was kind of hoping that we 'd we 'd be as well it 's a question of staff really but where 's the catchment and what are the numbers of people were expecting to use is for sorting because I find it really hard to approve a scope without seeing the kind of who the weather users are coming from and what the meter is it any kind of more information that we can look at in that regard and help andrea because it 's more your area than who 's the the catchment of the facility is roughly equivalent to about 60,000 people a traditionally the majority of the users come from within a two to four kilometer radius but a lot come from further if they prefer the facility the size of the facility reflects the fact that it is a a larger metropolitan facility you see the catchment should be slightly larger than jelly park and the facility is sized slightly larger it 's certainly so council considered this back in the 2012 13 annual plan where it made a specific decision on the the relative size of the facility and I think the expectation was set that it would be slightly larger than jelly park and that has been reflected in the in the scope as detailed in the table on my copy the later I think page 202 it is isn 't it very facility which apartments 30 yeah it 's a it 's a facility that we category in the same week as highs in the same ilk as jelly park and graham Condon and pioneer they are significant facilities and they are located out in the community the council 's made its decision the that the central the hub if you like will be the Metro sports facility but this is a biggie slightly bigger than jelly park to server a big catchment in a needy area well it 's good to have that clarification because we were given the impression that it was not considered metropolitan so that 's the word thank you when I look at the facility size pioneer and it 's no provision for indoor courts right yeah there 's the weight area just a bit you swimmin yeah a little bit bigger but pioneers actually overcrowded as it is so high Ania has an indoor has a wet area of 1964 square meters this has a proposed wet area of two thousand nine hundred and forty square meters so it 's a you know it 's at least a third larger the Pioneer the majority of the the center is indoor it 's three indoor courts the the dry area in the proposed eastern reckon Sports Center is 1630 basically one of the main points of conversation with the Ministry of Education will be them providing indoor courts and the community having the opportunity to use them it 's one of the synergies of locating schools and pulls on the same side the vast majority almost exclusive community use of indoor courts happens outside school hours the vast majority of use from schools for their own sports halls happens within school hours so there 's that there 's a great synergy there and that explains the personally feel uncomfortable delivered from the Advisory good today i do then we need to set up a parallel process to exit yeah I have one but it 's actually just to just come following on from their catchment one if you don 't mind just wondering with it with the catchments John is the is the total proposed area does that have any effect on on the catchment as in like if you 're proposing a beery are you going to put in new projections that more people are going to go there or do you simply put put a ring around the site and say 4k radius loves X amount of people the yacht these are all very flexible they are the the scope of this we believe is is probably slightly bigger than it needs to be and that provides for future growth the beauty of the qe2 site and explicit in the report is that there will be area set aside for expansion should that should that be the case they particularly with councils proposals for an indoor facility just to the south in lynnwood and park the plan for the metro will be very well served nevertheless we do have the opportunity to grow there should the city wish to do so in the future I guess my questions do you determine the catchment based on a calculation which which are encompass as the proposed totally area is that the formula is that how you is that how the formula is roughly the formula i said roughly in the aquatic facilities plan is one of these metropolitan facilities sixty thousand head of population okay and that 's the rule of thumb and then we are that then we look at the individuality of each community and needs to determine any different this would be fair this is slightly oversized okay no it 's right in the only other question i 've got there is i noticed that you do have a project contingency of five percent in a construction contingency of five seems beer yeah there and in commercially and that 's no no secret generally you 're looking at about timpson contingency for a really safe solid land and sometimes it will go above is potentially dicing we got davis langdon to do this we we said we 'd like it we would prefer a conservative estimate they 've assured us that this is a conservative estimate we do have our contingencies on the project and we do have contingencies on the construction there is a whopping figure of eight percent for escalation they I think with that and the natural conservativeness of davis langdon were covered the if anything we 'd hope to do a little bit more but we 're not going to involve those promises right now alright thanks John just this pioneers being used is so the measuring stick for through discussion we 're looking at a catchment a radius of 2.4 k is a catchment of 60,000 people just just to give an idea and of comparisons what 's the catchment for pioneer seeing it 's a she a third smaller than the proposed at the wheat eerie proposed in the aquatic facilities plan it 's a it 's a very similar catchment that we we plan for the I think it 's fair to say that particularly in out to the west that 's increased in population and I think that 's been reflected in councils our endeavors to bring forward the western recreation sports center thank you look I know I know things are kind of been happening with the Ministry of Education and fight came a little bit concerned to see that we 're going to wait another year to march 2016 for a report back personally I think that 's far too too long yeah I would but I also think that we are missing a kind of issue that is around the skype which is with the population growth in the closure of schools and the of school polls in this area I 'm really worried that the scope is actually answer system and I still don 't believe we actually have enough robust information to really understand what the needs will be for this area but this is a major facility for the eastern side of the city and I 'd be really concerned that we take a short-term view it now because we want to get on and get it done this leaving that indoor courts to the schools really concerns me because that is quite a different change and although it might make sense financially actually it could actually be quite detrimental to some of the community groups who wish to get access so we need to work through why we wouldn 't do indoor courts and what safeguards we have in place for community so how can we I guess really I think we do need to go back to that community advisory group how they also think we need to have a workshop at the committee to really look at the population projections the school issues with poles and also try and get a bit more of a feel for what are the key things that we need them are designed and I endorse the point that was made that it 's better to spend a little bit more time now it 's much more cost effective to do that before we go into the detail design to get the scope nailed rather than later um yeah I think if solutely and I 'll certainly defer to the chair that what we want is that the report be referred to the that 's to the chip committee for a workshop on the scope suppose correct sorry you want to finish on it is that it on the price scope and and also a workshop be held with the community advisory group and and other appropriate community boards and it 's very sick and difficult in you border involved as well so that the hot be referred to the cheek committee which would release for a workshop with the bill would Pegasus community for a joint workshop with the Burwood Pegasus community board and to have the egg and other interested parties there would make sense as well I mean I think given the the wider value of this major facility for the east and given what we 've heard in the deputation given you know clearly there 's some way to go with the Ministry of Education and and the need to absolutely get this right i think it would be good for the committee to have an understanding of the the considerations that the the CAG and the 've got to so that I mean I certainly don 't want to add any steps into the decision-making process but what I do want is to have good understanding and oversight of where this is at so that we can be supportive and we can continue to work together as this goes goes ahead so I 'm still amazed at how long this takes actually something keg representative of community groups so the hell do we need other community about appropriate other community boards in the initial one no no unfortunately when they do it big as I said their meeting was the same time that we had a workshop at egli pyramid so yeah I I which is different yeah I think take out community groups cuz you 've got that through the community advisor go one of the things that you saw it would be kind of saw it and Phillip Senate that schools are the key centers for our communities if you talk to young people they are so John I 'm just running with discussions with um with the Education Department how solid are those idea to match the two together so the community ere ratepayers our residents get a fair bit of being feedback and the community strengthens around the school where it should so I 'm just wondering one of the it seemed just a wee bit confused about the process with the Education Department the the process with the Ministry of Education Ministry of Education as we know have been looking for a home for high schools they have recently confirmed that there are their choice is the qe2 site the that the next step in the process is as you 've said to go down and do the detail council needs to control exactly how those conversations are had and managed to allow counsel to do that and to allow counsel to understand all facets of those discussions a report comes to counsel I believe through the property consultancy manager outlining all the factors a number of options for how those discussions happen and comes to you for sign off before we go and do that detail thank you no I 'm happy to support the amendment into the board recommendation to have in this process of really clear definition of whether ministries were the advantages to us Afeni in having a the ministry involved in this and we 're the advantages and focusing on it primarily being a community pool in a metropolitan community pool at that so that we 're not compromising the community use and I think that it 's up to the these representatives here on the keg and the community boards to actually have that clear definition and in place so that we know what we 're talking about and we know what type of facility were going to get if it 's going to be a gram khandaan type thing that 's going to end up a very different thing than I think that the community thanks they 're going to get so I would support the salons that we address that and have that clarified early on are you including the substantive in this as well Vicky or just the amendment at this but you 'd like all the debate on the whole lot all right okay all right well I will support this holdups I mean we want speed and process they 've been enough holdups already and we need to keep this ticking over what I would say is that for me the dynamic that sits behind this is that there 's with what happened in that area we kind of have to compensate the other way so if you think of that I ap to speak from that this is the dynamic I 'm picking up that the community does need involvement with us they need to be fully engaged the door needs to be kept open there 's going to be struggle with this the whole way and I picked this every step of the way there 's going to be a fight because people in the East have always had to fight for their facilities and this is just how does they had to fight to get this in the first place in 1974 and this is going to be like this with qe2 anyway the board did hear the CAG a couple of weeks ago David my good friend and colleague here was particularly feisty over that there the any further detail on this would come back to the community board let 's keep the door open to the community and if we don 't they 'll ensure they keep their foot and then anyway that being said I do support what the board have said here and i think i will go with that workshop i was resistant at first because i wanted to keep the whole process moving along but if it does bring on board greater ownership i think that 's good but let 's just get this done it might speed up can I just ask what 's the outcomes you want from this workshop in what decision making are you delegating to the community board it all the advisory group and that meeting so our intention in proposing the workshop is that there should be no certainly from my point of view there should be no change the decision-making as it 's already been set out and that this shouldn 't slow down the process at all it 's just you know today we 've heard a deputation which has raised some concerns of Education relationship there are obviously some catchments which are wider than the ward which we 've heard about this morning as well so I think the committee just needs to have a good understanding of where the process is out what 's happening with this major facility where we can help but without hindering the decision-making process or slowing things down at all and i think it 's it 's good if the committee has got a good view of where the CAG and the community board are coming from in its thinking so that it 's socialized with a wider group of councillors so that we 're able to be supportive of what 's coming through from the community and the community borders as their happens I mean you know we may well have some ideas that come out of that workshop that can speed the process up that can allow greater involvement from the community and that actually support the communities of and the board 's objectives so we we need to have the conversation and we need to share the knowledge in order for that to and sort of sharing thinking session than in any way the committee wanting to to muscle in on decision-making and certainly we wouldn 't want to slow things down we definitely wouldn 't want to do anything that slows down the process as the deputy mayor said if there 's something comes out of that can speed things up I for one would be absolutely delighted that would be the outcome I would like I think there 's a timeline is far too long yeah that was a good answer that John knows Ian yes differently we added in a couple of these board recommendations or sooner and it was our attempt to to do to speed that up too I just wanted to make comment with regards to John talking about the fit and the synergy with the school I think there are some lessons learned from the ground Condon Center a number of them but one other thing to keep in mind is that you may find that the school is using it during the day but during the day is also when young mothers and mothers and saying it 's all cool that we 've got the school in there at a time that it hasn 't got a high use when in fact there does a use and it 's an important use so i just want to make that point yeah just as soon as we bit- the 50-meter as schools have been hiring pulls forever in a day in the city for school sports for swimming program so since it 's a relevant whether it 's a council pool and then it sense with regards to when they hire these facilities for those events they almost have exclusive use when you look at pioneer which was used as an example for after-school programs it 's absolutely chauke there are things that have been during the day so these things these are marriages if you like between the education apparently council can certainly work and work extremely well but that 's the next step and I 'm only going to support this because I hope that those that are involved in it or speed the process because this needs to happen and I 'd love just seems a bit of negative and but it 's a really positive this has been happening for even a day with schools using public facilities that 's what it was just that um I noticed that the bird figures community board but I did ask that maybe the higley free make you could be invited i don 't know that Andrew was going to seek and that we I would stick with this one and then invite the sum of those representatives on that 's fine I can just raise it with the chair after they go on ok can I suggest we put this now i 'm going to put yannis amendment moved and seconded those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and that now becomes part of the substantive motion which is moved by Glenn and seconded by paul in i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you i 'm going to move on to Part B and because so far we 've got through half of the bill with pigs as community board Part B thanks John of those _"

    "text": "might be helpful to start with build Pegasus so you okay with it Andrea so this is item 10 12 on the agenda and page 93 Andrea welcome oh thank you thank you so I will start off on a lovely hi we finally got to the final new bright and sent a master plan or being approved and gone through with the board and we 're happy to present it to you there was one very very slight change that we made which I just lost a page it was on and just around the the board didn 't support the turning off the pedestrian dest realized portion of the sea view mall and to a slow road we would prefer to keep it as a pedestrian area but other than that we were we were happy for the master plan to be brought to you today I probably should get this moved clean you might have to move in seeking to thank you very much i bow twice today but if I may make a quick comment on that three just simply that the board has listened to of the the more that that 's quite a key part that we there is retained as it is and you will see the other parts the basic thrust of the plan is to consolidate that the area there so to rejuvenate and your Brighton putting through the plan today sends out that signal of confidence a plan is about certainty and sending out that signal today by adopting this finally it 's been quite a few years in the making work will be good I 've got a question for Andrew if I may I 've been a big fan of all of these master plans as they 've come through and it 's good to see this one here on our agenda today I 'm always keen to go with the community board 's recommendations on these things as well because of course you guys have got the the local knowledge it would have been good to have seen a unanimous resolution from the board around this and obviously there has been some debate in some discussion about the pedestrianized portion of Seaview mold are you able to issue what the community 's view is and what the considerations have been behind the fact that we 've got your amended 8.2 which wasn 't in fact unanimously supported yeah um can I you bite one of you guys to come up and perhaps you guys might be able to explain the thought behind putting vehicles through that that area the reason that a lot of the community are against the idea is because it would make a t-intersection right on that junction of hawk street and marine parade where we want to with one of the big themes that came out of the master plan was we get a lot of people come to New Brighton they come to the pier they come to the library they come to the fore shore but they haven 't really been engaging across the road into the greater into the business of retail area and so we want to really make it attractive for people to cross the road and come in and spend their money and the shops and things down there so by putting a t-intersection right sort of 's going to disrupt the the options that we have for creating links between the foreshore in the the mall there 's been the community feel that we 've heard these guys have helped did the phone consultation and come up with a different answer so I guess it depends who you ask so deep the one you want to marry and return your call meet you automate and just that with a community we consulted on the possibility of reintroducing and some slow speed traffic through the more when the draft master plan was prepared we had what appeared to be a mixed result forty percent of submitters signaled their support for that idea and forty-six percent opposed the idea with the remainder either not responding or not knowing so for the final amendments made to the master plan we suggested that because the because of the mixed result that perhaps that project and the short-term shouldn 't be pursued but to keep the option open as a long-term possibility may be sensible and the draft text and the draft final teeth suggested that before the idea is progressed to medium-term and plan actions and then of the community if there was support within the community that the idea could then be potentially trial on a either transitional project level basis or trial dersim by days of the week or hours through the day so it 's really just providing a future policy context and the medium or long term for their option having said that the board does judge matin decide the preference and that 's reflected in the recommendation one more question on that mean one of the reasons for these master plans is to support the the redevelopment of these suburban centers and obviously the small businesses play quite a big part in the redevelopment of somewhere like New Brighton what was if you 're aware of what the the business view of this particular proposal was I 'd be particularly interested in what some of the small businesses in that area what their view was of this proposal because of course this is something that clearly could be seen to benefit the businesses by bringing increased slow-moving traffic into the area or on the other would be better for the generational redevelopments of that area I know that the new bride and business association which obviously doesn 't speak for all businesses but does speak for I think a majority of businesses they were against rented reintroducing traffic into that area I don 't know I haven 't spoken tablet as businesses myself so I don 't have statistical information about what proportion of those submitters who supported or opposed the concept at the draft master plan stage were business owners and we didn 't cut the analysis that way there was a couple of smaller workshops held post draft master plan with property and business landowners to discuss the concept of consolidating the commercial center and that was required as part of the district plan review process and we had some verbal feedback at the workshops that there was some support amongst a small number of the business owners who attended there but it was not a statistical once again not statistical feedback it was just within the forum of that workshop that there was some openness to the idea as part of revitalizing 's thinking was that it can still be brought up again in the future the master plan isn 't a legislative process I do it we we 've taken it out so that we can hear some clarity because it was sort of a mixed call but there 's no reason that than five years we can 't have this discussion again there 's nothing precluding that but it just give again we set out it gives the community I seen some sort of yeah yeah so I can tell you they 're so good thank you I 'm just trying to understand how you 're going to implement the urban design and I know that you 've got some quite good description and in the in there on page 172 a 17 1 but what I don 't see is how that actually gets followed through so I had I don 't see how that 's going to be implemented and I 'd like to move a resolution to support that being implemented so can you just help me understand what we need to do to actually get that what social insulin for a lot of the most effective on characters yeah a lot of the master plan has been done in close consultation with the Business Association and they 've great really well with the stopper blendable Association and the staff has been quite a cool process to watch and they 're sort of done up in collaboration and in a way so that it 's the businesses are behind what 's gone on the master plan so that 's enabling more likely to enable it to heaven if it makes sense the question is is this something that we need to put into our district play and to support this code because I don 't see like I support the comments that were made that these master plans are really nice and you know visually they present an attractive option but I don 't see where the teeth or the rules are that actually helped deliver on these objectives so is there anything we should be doing as part of our recommendations to give a bit more teeth to getting the things that are you know coming 've notified or you 've taken the step to to notify the phase two chapters of the district pain and the that that was commercial actually I have to confess was commercial in phase one or phase two of the of the district plan review but there 's already even designed provisions that you 've considered as part of that process and and miranda is already referred to the fact that there were workshops with with the business community that were quite specifically directed to the commercial component of the district peer review so as far as we are able to understanding that there are a number of I suppose competing demands on what council puts into the district clean review we 've we 've taken that to that point there are a number of other tools that we can have in our toolbox around even designed around guidelines in some of those have been done for Sumner and I think the summon progress for littleton and in our pre-application advice working with developers working with the business community so it would seem to me that it 's not about they 're in component of the master plan I are on the advice of staff you so I 'm here a worthless as it is okay thank you have you have you got an amendment I think we need to either get the community board or the council making a submission to the district where around the bus interchange as well because that 's highlighted in here as being needing to be designated through the district plan but there 's no resolution in front of us that shows that relationship so maybe maybe I can ask remember back from star over what are the points that should be raised through the district plan that result from this place yes that bottle and then set up a process for those we action he wants me to get up and I otherwise I 'm going to keep clean to actually you 've moved the report doesn 't make a point of clarification I know it 's another and I just called you sorry because they need to move edition of each Clause like the potatoes us individually or does the reporters okay please okay and poignancy can be right Glenn thank you for the another bite at the cherry there just thank you just in relation to 8.2 where it talks about the board supporting the retention of the pedestrianized portion of the sea view more if we could have support for that given that the purpose of the master plan as it says us to help direct land of business owners in the redevelopment of the center and to attract private investment there was a strong push from them that we retain the dist realized portion of the mall so that 's one SP which I think really needs to be taken heat off today an hour you know deciding on this I don 't put that move to second it need about not i 'll put it and those in favor please say aye those opposed to carried no thank you you will pack the items yet there was not nothing right so Glenn or move and Pauline or second I 'll put those those in favor please say aye those opposed to carried that the reporters the whole be just before we move on to the other one I was supposed to move a resolution to be passed which is on page 693 to include supplementary papers which are listed on page 693 which is everything from the vision city housing revenue Spencer park capital establishment of crushed Development Authority and provisional financial advisory services thanks Tim seconded Jamie okay so you can dish to Le got that doesn 't pay release very reluctantly can i seduce that somebody gives Jamie the supplementary because there 's quite a lot of meat in it I mean all right okay right that 's what it 's scary it just I think it 's interesting for staff if they could actually explain in a general sense why some of these have been put on because I can understand some light city house-sitting housing revenue has a deadline date Spencer path of the online dates it doesn 't seem to be much urgency and I do wonder why okay can i seduce that we put them on as we come to them you can if you like choose to defer them ok but of them some of them do have timelines that have to be dealt with said ok ok so you can did I 'll second it so that but you can decide at the time if you want to be able to defer them or whatever so can I put that recommendation those in favor please say aye those opposed carried one vote two now Andruw a journalist just a point of clarification on that so we 've adopted the agenda but you 're happy to further debate whether we accept each item by item as we go yes absolutely and you 're free to debate whatever you like when we get to them I 'm just going to take it when we get to them though some of them do have timelines you know I appreciate how to network than they like I mean I only received cash yesterday some happen to even have is it also has a fine to consume I 'm happy to take that there but they are currently for consideration in the consideration maybe to defer them right okay and the second part of the who would pick _"

    "text": "thanks guys Eric Eric banks regarding item 27 freedom camping welcome Eric you know the rules so you 've got 10 minutes and they 'd includes questions thankful thing as a short notice Eric banks and Janice Beaumont we we live others in relation to the freedom camping court later this morning we live on Marine Parade opposite the ramp car park excuse me the ramp car park we were made aware on Tuesday evening the council had come up with a temporary solution to the issue of freedom campus which originally or recently became an issue in Burford Street and were ended up moving down to Rio muri beach broad Park area and there were complaints there and so what the solution council staff have come up with is to direct them down to the ramp car park next to the surf club as a temporary measure we were not overly happy that we weren 't consulted beforehand because we 've lived it for a number of years and obviously we have quite a few ideas of our own about how the area could be better managed and the around for quite a long time and particularly post quakes and we we would have preferred to have had some discussion before this decision was made I do support what we do support the general staff intention to come up with an overall plan for freedom camping in the city and but we believe that that should really have been undertaken given a bit more thought before freedom campers were directed to another area because it 's really just transferring the same problems that you had bear for the street the same problems that you 've had at broad park into another area our area of you like the ramp car park has had problems over several years and that that 's only going to increase some of the problems we will have directly opposite we were in full view of the campus the campus moved in last night straight away there 's a guy brushing his teeth and although that doesn 't sound too bad you know it wasn 't using a you know wasn 't trying to hide it and spitting on the ground that sort of thing campers just toileting themselves they 're not bothering to use the toilet toilet about 100 meters away they 're too lazy to go and use it so you know children have to see what the result of that is it 's not very pleasant rubbish is always a problem there the inadequate bins and I understand they 've been some additional bins put in closer to the toilets but the number of bins in the main area opposite area area our house is probably still inadequate there are a number of solutions that perhaps I could discuss with staff but in terms of restricting the area and screening it perhaps but we wouldn 't want to see that become permanent facility i believe council should be providing facilities in other areas for freedom campers and perhaps as a temporary solution rather than public car park it should be maybe in one of the council campground Spencer park or South Brighton for example maybe an area of that why not at least those that designed to have campers in you know it 's this setup for it they 're not immediately which exists at Marine Parade so I as I say and support the direction the council 's taking and finding an overall medic preps an overall management plan for dealing with freedom campers but I would also support a freedom camping by law to give council staff a bit of extra teeth in terms of dealing with issues and we would hate to see a temporary solution become permanent would you like two seconds yeah and thank you I 've been a resident and owner of the property they were currently in since 1990s so I 've seen it all and one of the issues would be that if the gate one gate has left open all night that we may return to the 1990s where we had significant problems with young motoring enthusiasts using it for all sorts of wrong things I find that this area is one of the only places in Christ Church where people with mobility issues can actually go and enjoy a view of the sea there 's nowhere else that offers the same thing in Christchurch and I know that at the time that people stopped coming down to eat the sandwiches and watch the sea because they felt intimidated and when you get 20 people camping over the road with washing strung-out burners going there drinking I 've got micro parties that happen at night when they stick their speakers out on top of the vehicles I find that a really intimidating sort of a scene for anybody and that sort of set you know the people are coming down just to use it for you know a nice place to sit so I don 't think it 's appropriate to use car park or that sort of thing there 's health issues as well there 's defecation and the bushes we have our children seeing people you know just turning our way and urinating in the bushes and you know it 's a two minute walk down to the toilet so that 's just some people spoiling it the showers are used by many people then for actually washing in so the shampoo and soap being used and the drain goes straight to the sand and then I see children the next 't think that 's very healthy and there 's the the whole I 'm sure it 's a liquor been a long marine parade so does that include the car part I haven 't had time to actually look into that but they are drinking up there so you know that 's another issue that we have and eric said that you know the waist area you know the rubbish bins and things aren 't really adequate that totally inadequate and they always have been they 've never got it right up there there 's always stuff blowing out all over the place because the bins are not large enough for the capacity of the sort of events that are held down at the beach whether it be serve carnivals or kite day or whatever they they never cut mustard but also these people come from countries these visitors enough we think it 's lovely that they see New Brighton as a destination a tourist destination because many people in Christchurch don 't so we would love to have them there but we 'd like them to be better accommodated litre plastic empty drink bottles cardboard boxes this big I 've got a photo of it from last night and these people come from countries where they do it properly and they recycle so at least they 're separating out their stuff and they 're putting it in large boxes at the base of the rubbish bins so until sitting here come along and clean that up in the morning that 's a bit of an eyesore so it 's totally inadequate that the setting the earth or camping and I don 't believe that it should happen at all even as a short-term thing actual and subject matter today on item 27 I 'm assuming your preferences for a bylaw type approach to the whole issue yes of bylaw as well as a overall management plan okay thank you for coming along and sharing all of this with us today um I 'm interested in a couple of things first of all how long these freedom campers are staying for are they are they just there overnight and then moving on or are they kind of taking up residence second question relates to interface with the council have you been calling the council raising requests for service discussing with staff about this and do you think for example a freedom camping hotline might be a good way forward so that there 's a clear channel for reporting any of the behaviour you 're talking about where action could be taken into the council and their range of freedom campers people working there temporarily people homeless people and there are people who are tripping around the country as tourists so we 've certainly had people camping there for over a week two weeks young people who are working in the city they set up it looks it looks like a campground you know it 's washing lines you know they take up car parks with seating and cooking facilities etc etc the party areas so it 's a whole range of people and some of them do stay there for a long time and some of the move out come back again others say Lee all day so it 's a whole range and we have reported on a few we 've reported issues specific issues some of the less desirable ones we certainly have reported and I think in the report it talks about monitoring officers I think if they were able to continue and there was a dedicated person that we could report information to because it does sometimes feel that issues do get lost and I think really one of the main reasons for coming today is just to make you as well as staff aware of the issues there that it 's not just a better solution than having them in broad park or other areas it 's it 's it 's an ongoing issue and we think we have some ideas going forward working with staff to come up with a better solution just some shunting them on with very few additional facilities even a temporary nature is not a solution thank you thanks and I wonder if to be helpful to people in the audience if we might move on to we 're going to return to the community board SAT across the array there are no petitions Oh in that case we 're going down to the community boards but over _"

    "text": "acknowledge my colleagues comments they just made but he he talked all about risk and all i want to say as i look at the opportunity that this document actually provides us as a council to talk to our community and that 's the important part where to take here today this is the start of a conversation we do not need to get into detail around this table today we need to do out and talk to our people ask them what they think is gonna be the right thing for our future and i would actually imagine that the people of Christchurch want to see a bright future and that comes with cost so how do we fix that cost and that 's the question and the discussion we will have with our community and I do ask them to get up and actually make themselves known and what the feelings are and how they see the future being put together for the betterment of that our future generations because the last thing you want to do right now is under under sort of perform and a way where people want to come and be a part of the city and and bring up their families here we 've got to make sure that we if you do not actually undervalue our future and I think that 's really really important so that 's the conversation will get out without our public let 's not talk about the risks because everything in life has a risk but we have to look at the opportunities I think you are gleam thank you I think it 's a privilege today to be in this position of putting out for consultation a 10-year plan I 'm not sure how often this will come around for elected members unless you serve on the council for a long time but we 're in this position today of being able to do this and then here the submissions on that and make the final decisions the first part of what I 'm going to say is about the future because I know you the nur encouraging us to take that big picture view and then I just like to come back quickly to the vision which is preferred future and I 'd like to also follow another one of his principles which is taking the end on view and looking back from 2025 and if I do that and try to look at christchurch through the eyes of a visitor these are the things which i would like to see which are picked up in the consultation document that we actually do have a cleaner restored even with an expanded river it could be a flat water facility but that 's more the government 's call and resource i think the the river and that respect would have the potential to unite the city around the various schools and rowing kayaking canoeing waka ama etc in the future we can envisage the river as part of the residential Rigzone now a green zone where its greatest strength is the natural environment its wetlands and it 's green belt I also see that we are host to local and international sporting events around that River with a renewed new brighton as its destination through the eyes of a visitor and I 've come to see the best water in the world and so it 's critical that we protect our low-lying unconfined aquifers we 're also known for the warmth of our welcome and hospitality and that actually goes a long way something else that 's come home strongly to me too is the accessibility and speed of internet this is something which Yanni and Jamie picked up on a few years ago and I didn 't take much notice of it but I 've night I 've now seen it 's critical if you 're a visitor to another city in the meantime though we need to attended my view to the basics first we need to ensure that we have community facilities in this respect I touch on two in my part of the town at our PT and South you brighten that if we 're talking about resilience I think we owe it to our communities to come back with a plane so we may say are we going to close this or alter this but I think let 's give them a chance to come back with a plan I 'm if our visitors say we want this experience and the locals say we want the same experience for instance over camping grounds then we need to find a way to match that up we need to fix our roads that is community well-being we need to restore our infrastructure I 'm also keen obviously on greater housing choices especially around affordability and habitability and I 'd like us to stand firm on our life mark and Home Star principles which we 've also been pushing for you know my view on assets and I 'm happy for this consultation obviously to go out to the community and we will have that debate at the end of that it 's been a privilege to get the spark knowledge all the work of the staff and you as my colleagues and I look forward to the coming months and as with Vicki I enjoy that process of the local community being able to have access to us at post it 's one of the highlights of the year for me Ellie just very briefly we are an extraordinary time still everything needs this amendment it 's not about privatization this is about possibilities about partnerships and it 's about people and it 's about opportunity and without the options and the document without this appendix we have fewer options for people to consider and we need to keep the semi settle anthem I 'm thinking oh I 'm going to actually talk to the the actual situation with the gas that pinned x3 the reeds redefining a strategic asset what is a strategic asset as Eddington Rena ball castle arena a strategic asset some people may say yes some people say no lien case depart without doubt has an incredible history I was here you know the privilege of watching a free and run on to play one of the first a grade or so professional rugby league games here i was on the embankment the embankment hasn 't been here for a while and if you look at the stadium that it 's damaged and the wording on it and it couldn 't be much bigger if they tried as AMI Stadium with regards to off street parking will its face from the door there and I 'm the counselors shareholding and V base if we are going to look at redefining strategic esas what does a strategic asset christchurch internationally port without question is that is the drop off point for the southern experience in christchurch as the anchor and the gateway for that we have deep freeze there we are the gateway to Antarctica it is without question a strategic a siege the little import company and port an export for the south island it 's the biggest and busiest port in south island again absolutely essential to the South Island and Christchurch and Orion of course OMG are armed electric electric electricity network and again Dennis without Christian essential so when we talk about the pendeks three and it states an appendix 3 that council is not proposing that these be solved the eddington arena venkat apart all off street parking in the council 's shareholding and v base what we 're asking and it and at this document is what do the people of Christchurch what do the residence in Christchurch believe and I think that this because you may not want the answer from the people the residents the ratepayers of Christchurch it is essential to leave it in this document and I will not be supporting this thank you there any other speakers all right what I would like to say a couple of words and I wasn 't going to speak on the amendment but but i endorsed what what terms to see it and i won 't be supporting the amendment but I what I want to do is remind people that this is the first time that the city of christchurch will get to look at the true state of financial affairs of their city since 2009 that was the last time that an auditor long term plan went out for public consultation so this is the first time that they 're actually looking at the true state of our financial affairs the three-year plan was not audited and there are elements within it that we now know would not have survived the order process we know that for sure having been through that ourselves 398 million dollars was put in that the work that caught a mint that did for us that infect the council never intended to find 398 million dollars worth of savings it was their assessment and in fact an agreed assessment as to what the true cost of the horizontal infrastructure repair would be and it was the total that would be added to the cost sharing agreement that was subject to the independent review we don 't have the results of the independent review we cannot put that in the document and it certainly is unsustainable as savings to be found so we 've had to add that into the into the budget we also found from quarter mentha that there were heroic assumptions around the insurance recoveries it is it is it is a challenge for a city to to actually resolve what it is and and is not going to do when it doesn 't actually know how much it will gain by way of insurance recoveries and we are working hard on that so quarter mentor identified these what Cameron partners did was they ensure that we could go to the public with freeing up capital from our asset base and that essentially as what underpins our financial strategy there are those who will say and in fact people who have already said that we haven 't required enough of the organization in terms of the activity these of the organization in terms of levels of service and in terms of the capital program we 've asked our chief executive to prioritize this work and to feed that into the decision-making process as you see the recommendation today has us making a final decision on the long-term plan by the 30th of June this year and and she 's got a tough job ahead of her but that is the job of the chief executive as we have said in this consultation document it is a base case and we will continue to work on all of the issues that emerging is numbers crystallize we will make adjustments and that means that we 're signaling in this document that in fact we may be back with quite a substantial change in the annual planning process next year and I think by being upfront are and our knowledge and how they might be improved over time and that 's that 's the sort of signal that I want to give in relation to the rates and creases you know I really want to kind of signal that we 're really going to be looking at those rates increases that has caused considerable concern out there in the public arena the extent of the rates increases and of course they are adding one year then the second year and then the third year in order to come up with a total and and what I want to encourage people to do is focus on the first year because we will review it all again next year and we will be assessing whether any of the changes that we can embed in place for that process can impact on the following year in terms of rates increases so very much wanting to signal to the people of Christchurch that our focus is going to be making sure that this is affordable as well as achievable I called my message at the front of this document building feedback about how people didn 't like the word regeneration so I said we 'll come up with a better word and no one has yet so this is the challenge that I put to you who count around the table not so much for a focus the reason that I then I then went to the dictionary to find a dictionary definition of regeneration and I found out it actually encapsulate what I was intending and that is that in a post disaster environment the initial response phase is focused immediately on what needs to be fixed what needs to be got back on its feet and then we move into a more of a recovery frat phase and that 's the phase that we 've been and then the next step is regeneration in my view it means restoration so it means putting back what was there before but it also unkept within its meaning new growth so it actually talks about new ways and i loved how uncle in Lovingston talked about you know the capacity for that amazing swath of land alongside our river the what actually says to me that this could be the heart of our recovery is a city in the connection between the the city and the sea and in a way that you can only imagine and it 's and it 's that sort of thing that keeps bringing me back to this incredible sense of opportunity that we have as a city and the incredible optimism that I feel personally about what we could achieve we have a chance of a lifetime and I said this and the introduction to turn what was a disaster unto the opportunity to create a smart green livable sustainable world class City that 's what the people of Christchurch dreamed we could be and share an idea and this is the beginning of a process to enable that dream to become a reality so now it 's time for the people of Christchurch to have their say on the financial strategy that can provide us with the base case to enable that to happen so on that basis I 'll move to the amendment and given that I suspect that there will be a on the screen if the people who support the amendment can turn a signal yes and the people who are opposed to the amendment to it 's not quite ok ok so the appendix 3 be amended and be amended and the consultation document and their council continue including you know that 's ok that no no but that achieves what they want to achieve which is that these four there is a lot more in appendix 3 then just this part of it and the intention of the amendment is that simply these four assets remain on the strategic assets list yep no that appendix 3 be amended amended ok well that the appendix 3 be amended and then take out in the consultation document be amended so that so take out the word end so that council continue including on the strategic assets thus these as strategic asset data ok all right so if you are in favor of that amendment press yes and if you 're opposed to that priest note and that is lost so we 'll now move to the resolution and i will put say no that 's carried unanimously thank you very much so _"

    "text": "Thank You counselors if we could take our seats I just want to we 've just worked very hard to get the the resolutions correct and I think we are now on our way and and we 've also received an amendment which counselors will be at moving as well so and that any second now these will appear on the screen and I 'm going to move them I don 't know if the deputy beer would like to sicken them site on the scene you can trust me okay so I 'm going to move this and so I need a seconder for it what these recommendations do and it 's just run through them we 're receiving the consultation document that was tabled at the meeting today we note the recommendations from the reconvened audit and risk management committee meeting and further note that the mayor and the chief executive have signed the letter of representation because that was the key to getting the audit opinion approves the changes to the underlying information made since the council meeting on the twenty-sixth of febrian adopts the audit New long-term plan including the unqualified audit report for public consultation authorizes the mere the chairperson of audit and risk management committee and the chief executive to make non-material amendments to the consultation document to allow for consistency and alignment across the various documents reviewed and cleared previously by audit New Zealand and then agrees to run concurrent consultation processes for those documents and policies that need to be consulted on as part of the development of the final long term plan and adopts the following additional documents for public consultation we 've already adopted them but we need to adopt them for public consultation approve the following process for consultation outlined in the report but improved the following process for consultation can you take out the words outlined on this report including public notification star press and the council 's website by the 17th of March and the reason that I 've taken that out as I 've added we 've increased the period for submissions to the 27th of April and the reason for that is is to make sure that you know the Easter period I think yani within that period and and would mean that perhaps the four weeks weren 't as complete as they could have been and so just that extra week will be helpful and it 's going to require a bit of additional resource in terms of processing the submissions as they come in because we start the hearings I 'm on the 11th of may so you know this is the process going forward and that we are required to meet to adopt the long-term plan by the 30th of jun 2015 and then the last one is approve a joint governance including community board representation and management review of the long-term plan process in order to capture lessons learned and establish a robust process for the future to be reported to council by the 31st of all was 2015 so I 've put a relatively short time frame on that but that 's to capture you know the information now while it 's all fresh in people 's minds and make sure that that 's reported back so that others will benefit from the experience that we 've been through and that basis so and there is an amendment and I propose that either now for that amendment to be put and that we can debate all of those as a you know in the context of a of a single debate around the around the whole process so that 's so that that tabled amendment is accepted as well change the closing date to lean on the twenty-eighth of the community as a whole oh it 's a holiday is it Oh they 've got that it 's a transferable day right that was the so what what does it new noon you thinkin young noon on the Tuesday the 28th of April so people get an extra day because actually monday as as a statutory holiday the transfer of the holiday from NZ day so ndx day is still on the twenty-fifth but because it falls on a weekend that 's that 's been Monday eyes here I 've forgot that that law and change that might have changed after I leave Parliament anyway that 's all good so so that 's been moved counselor you 're handsome second seconded so I 'd like to invite counselors to debate the motion any member who would like to start Andrew thank you I 'll talk about the amendment first the effect of the amendment is to retain the listed assets on the strategic assets list and to remove appendix 3 from the consultation document that would mean that if we were at some point to remove these assets from the strategic assets list if we were to decide to do then we would need to pass a resolution to do so and then consult on that proposal on its own I appreciate the legal advice received this morning and that this is a process that we can use through the consultation document however if this is a path the council chooses to take I would prefer this to duck to be done by a single explicit proposal which would allow for what in my view would be a greater informed and more open debate on this issue and its implications rather than as part of this wider consultation so that 's that 's the reason for my support of the consultation document this represents an important point in the long-term plan process not least because of the amount of work that has gone into producing such a document in extraordinary times and I acknowledge the amount of work that has been done but because this is the first time since the earthquakes that the public 's had the opportunity to comment on the true state of the council 's finances and hopefully to contribute to the solution to some of the problems that are outlined the beginning of one of the paragraphs in the mayor 's opening statement sets the tone the single most important issue we want your feedback on is our proposal to find more capital by either wholly or partially selling some of our assets now this is essentially the question been asked on page 8 of the consultation document these are big issues but I 'm not going to debate the contents of the proposal today much of the financial strategy was debated in our last council meeting in this chamber but what I am going to say loud and clear is that we do want the proposals in the document the situation that we find ourselves in in reasonably extraordinary times means the questions in the financial in the documents are largely financial in nature they 're their questions which are actually about priorities not just rate rises or asset sales but other options to questions around levels of service operational savings capital expenditure deferral of projects different ways of delivering things or in some cases whether things actually even need to be delivered at all and we want to hear what residents priorities are so that we can listen and let those priorities guide decision-making around changes to what at this stage of course is just a draft proposal and it may well be that the proposal will change considerably between now and the end of June some of those changes will be as a result of the additional work that we as a council and staff to do and some of the changes will be as a result of the public feedback on these proposals the extra these are extraordinary times as I say and they require a bold vision and some bold as a community to hold our nerve keep true to our values and to remember from our point of view that government is governing a city is not just about the city itself but it 's about the people that live here it 's not just about the present but it 's about the future it 's not just about the short-term fixes but the long-term legacies and this draft long-term plan needs to be not just the mayor 's plan not just the council 's plan but the people 's plan for the future of Christchurch so today 's debate for me isn 't about what I agree with or disagree with that 's in the document it 's about people getting engaged in a conversation with us about it about its content and i 'll be voting to receive the document today get the consultation underway so that we can start that conversation with the people example anyone else Vicki I agree with Andrew that this is about actually getting people 's views on options going forward and I think the really good thing is that there are certainty a lot of certainty about their financial possibilities that the city has we 're in a fortunate position that we do have financial possibilities that are there and we can actually solve the financial issues and get on with certainty in terms of building and rebuilding this city again in terms of the consultation document I have to say one of the nicest experiences I think there is in terms of being a counselor is listening to people 's input on what they want done in the city and I love the fact that they come up with all sorts of amazing ideas all the time I 'm quite keen that we experiment this time with to find some different ways of doing that some additional ways and I did suggest it Tilly ants and she 's going to be away for a couple of weeks that we might use her office as a place where we could actually invite people to be near for 15 minutes and tell us what they wanted to do with the city and what they 'd like gun and and not done I like there it 's quite tidy actually Lee Anne 's office it will be but I would like to thank and people who have put this together I know it 's been an unusual process a difficult process and one that 's and required an enormous amount of energy and time from a lot of people a lot of people in Council and and cakes looking very shy which is the first time I 've experienced that and I 'd also like to thank external organizations like the audit people because I think they put a huge amount of effort and time into this and I think we are in a really good space actually this has been the focus for the last seven eight months there is as been done through the financial strategy in the infrastructure there are solutions and they are solutions that can work and now we need to get the most important government in in the financial plan internet financial plan and that 's what people want and don 't want and amended and change it accordingly and the cool thing about all that is about the go forward and that 's the exciting place to be and then we just get on and having gotten the people 's and put into this we just get on and do it which is the next exciting phase I think the council right I 'm cool Jimmy I 'm going to support the amendment I think that um parks like Eddington arena and link is to park the ax sporting icons for your city and they special should be special in terms of consultation overall I certainly support us doing this consultation on the overall financial strategy infrastructure strategy and I think the mayor 's message it in the beginning preface is something that 's really important that that is really around how that this the cost of the recovery actually has to be shared by not only this generation but future generations and we now that we know the facts that in fact this is so huge in terms of the fall costs that I think councils are agreed that in fact it 's this is taking more than years it 's taking tickets and there the we can 't do everything well at once and we 're all at the same time and like an example of that is that we need to explore count councils future spending on kept on capital projects and also operational costs and that needs to be done and so I think overall the document that there is there is fear that there is a balance between simply fixham especially around the infrastructure what 's broken and new opportunities that in fact we can a transformer city the other thing I wanted to talk about too is that an example of where there can be other ways of finding money is in around even Sokka ways that this clear comment in the document that we as a city can create a world-class network of psycho ace and it 's clear that the full costs are much higher than we had expected there are a hundred and fifty six million but in zijn ta are really tear that that they tell us and we know that there 's never been a better time to invest in cycling and just recently councillors parallel and also the Mentos street section of the unicycle we 're receiving 1.6 million dollars as government assistance around there so I think that 's an example where you know there 's a whole range of ways that I 'm expecting our people the public will comment on how and to help us as a council to be really successful in rebuilding and rejuvenating transforming Christchurch Thank You Jimmy I supported mayor deputy medical recommendation I also supported the amendment regarding to the consultation document we are over where there 's based on the twenty-sixth of februari the council top the one is infrastructure the strategy the other one is the financial strategy even and you know that is the disagree or to even to to kind of release 750 million dollars to kinda to sell those the even partially of asset even right now I 'm still disagree however I support this document go to the consultation because why at least give the other people give the community peoplepc group that an opportunity to free vector to us especially this the document hatred is for the future ten 30 years and also right now the the state of the kind of Light roadster earthquake recovery actually we enter into the new stage from original emergency response and toward repair we pupa right now we all aware right now is enter into the kind of state of the regeneration evener is the stage of the transformation so we need two more you know listen to people for their vision for their view for their the long-term goal especially for their priority so that 's wider even though i 'm not you know agree all the proposal but i still i would like to strong supporter east apache mina go to the consultation the other one where I support the list for tagged item you know to kill us the the strategic asset because currently you know the significance of the engagement palace currently are still this whole project is under the strategic ACS so whether if we consider have any amendment whether we waiting for you know maybe after three months when fee paper and after the hearing and we make decision now that right now because I know have to remove most for a kind of the exits so there 's the particular reason thank you thank you are Jamie look all I want to say this is actually quite a satisfying feeling after all the work that 's gone to this over the months upon months upon months upon months to be sitting here we 're about to pass this but what we 're passing is really only the chapter one really it 's the start of the conversation is a heck of a long way to go so we feel that we 've come a long way at the moment but you know we just are only warming up really so so that 's fantastic because ultimately this is this is what does Christchurch looked like and how we 're going to and how we 're going to pay for that so it 's a it 's the conversation about creating the Christchurch for christchurch by christchurch what I 'd really like to add to all this as other than echoing that the things that that 's it 's already been articulated around the table particular people that have put an enormous amount of work into this but I often often heart back to recovery not being about one thing in isolation what our city looks like it hasn 't succeeded and success isn 't when one thing functions amazingly well yes it says to us isn 't just having our infrastructure success isn 't when Christ which has the best flushing toilets in New Zealand you know exactly it doesn 't mean anything one thing in isolation is utterly irrelevant you know you can have the best of investor sure in the world but if you don 't have an economy it 's all for naught you can have the best you know economy for a moment but it 's it 's not sustainable if you 've gotten a culture to a city and you can have all the culture and the world that 's not really sustainable if you don 't have the next thing so you can never look at anything as an eagle or one thing in isolation above anything else is how it works as a package to create a city of a better word and the other aspect to that is how you 're going to pay for it and I think it 's exactly the same success isn 't about one thing as an outcome or as an end product and actually how you 're going to get there isn 't about one thing either because I think we all know that well there are a number of levers that are in front of us pulling any one of them in isolation doesn 't do it and I think that second part of the conversation or not just what does success look like for our community but how are we going to be able to fund it says there 's also about that holistic approach selling absolutely everything really doesn 't leave us with a lot it 's not going to be an option putting rates through the roof to pay for everything just isn 't going to be an option either so it 's about looking at something intelligent intelligently and having that intelligent conversation with community to find their balance that would be as focus forward so table anyone else that 's worked so hard on this and I look forward to having that conversation with with the community about what our city looks like and how and how we pay for it I 'm just with respect to the amendment now I 'm not going to support the amendment and in my view I think it just limits your options and if you 're going to limit the options that you consider then you 're going to limit the ultimate quality of the outcome so that just seems a bit nonsensical to me canny thank you I 'll speak in favor of the amendment and also just acknowledge that it 's really important that we have a consultation document so although I disagree with things in that CD I think the important thing is that we do put it up for public consultation I 'll start off with the amendment and I ask counselors to consider the strategic value that we have with Eddington arena currently called the home castle arena think about how many community groups have it access to that facility over time through those nonprofit community groups there is the risk of removing it from a strategic asset list is that those community groups who have every right to use council facilities will have less opportunity if it becomes private and in the consultation government the original government is that it 's not necessary for us to retain ownership for the well-being of our community I fundamentally disagree with that likewise for parking buildings think about the council having not a single car parking building in the central city think about the tickets that people will get when they 're 10 minutes late 65 seventy dollars if they 're going to a metro sports to swim paying three times as much for car parking as they pay to go swimming these are the risks and these other options I think people need to be very aware of if if this amendment is lost so I don 't think it 's right to get rid of all our council car parking buildings and I don 't think it 's right to remove them off a strategic asset list in fact off street parking will of our city because of the loss the huge loss of on-street car parking so I argue that it is absolutely strategic that council retains these assets formats list I want to talk about link has to park it 's a park that has a huge and proud history in that area removing it as a strategic asset turns a really poor signal I believe to those local communities who over time we had one of the best relationships between local residents in a major stadium and a residential neighborhood we were the envy of every other city in new zeal because of the way in which those reasons worked around the redevelopment and got on with the stadium doing the things that wanted that community Phillips talent Olson has lost so much in the earthquake they 've lost his school they 've lost a lot of historic buildings the stadium the future of that link has to park is actually an incredible piece of work a critical piece of work that needs to be done and I do believe it 's a strategic piece of land that should be on some other points in the document and that is that the community facilities I note that in the document talks about our community facilities been underutilized whether it 's swing poles or libraries I want to make the point that the Sarah well-being survey that came out see that it 's over a third of residents continue to rate the second highest issue having a negative impact on their daily lives was the loss of leisure facilities there 's people in areas that don 't haven 't had a library for four years the people on some of them for example so i think it 's i think it 's really important that we stress that actually the song communities they haven 't paid community facilities and they actually miss them and they want them back and i don 't believe that 's a reason to say that that underutilized i think in fact it strengthens the argument that we need to get on and repair those local community facilities that people are listening i want to touch on that issue of asset sales because clearly an appendix to the financial strategy which is selling off entire company 's one hundred percent whether as a possibility whether it 's orien whether it 's rebus whether it 's any of those other companies that are on that appendix to you so i urged the public to really read that information and makes emissions because a my view there are alternatives we will not be out of business if we do not sell off 750 million dollars of assets and we need to find alternatives and i believe there is no need to rush to sit to her into an irreversible agenda of ethics cells in the short term well we need to take a long-term view I 've worked out over 30 years we lose about nine hundred million dollars dividends from our from our holding companies if we sell them off to the extent that 's being proposed there 's 900 million that goes a long way to doing the things that we want to do at the city and it 's a lot of money that goes a long way to keeping rates at a more affordable level a risk of rates going up even more than they are at the moment and I think people need to be really aware of that as being the trade-off I just want to make the point that previously I 'm sorry in that in the in the document we 've also got a section on accessible City Transport we 've got a number of projects in near that that are being funded 118 million and the Knicks in the 10-year plan but also 260 million total of central city transport projects that have no commitment from funding from the crown that we 're proposing to do and I think it 's really important that people make submissions whether they think that it 's appropriate that we spend that level that huge amount of money on central city transport projects for streets that have already had their earthquake repairs in the central city at the expense of fixing the roads in the central city and again you know I know this isn 't the final map but there are roads that we are deferring over time that isn 't funding available to have around whether it 's appropriate and we 're to fix that the roads that aren 't going to be fixed currently under the skirt program so in conclusion I want to say that we were previously and proudly called the People 's Republic of Christchurch let 's retain that philosophy let 's not privatize our city I think it 's really important that we encourage the community to really think about what are the long-term trade-offs of this of the selling off assets in the short term and what does it mean for the long term there are alternatives in terms of our financial situation we 're told that we need to find 600 million in the next two years think about this 450 million of carry forward 150 million of central city projects are 118 plus about a hundred million in our endowment fund there are alternatives that 's not a trade-off between asset sales or x increases it 's actually a trade-off around many other things particularly around being able to afford to spend the money that we have and not being able to spend or things like central city anchor projects that we cannot afford when we 've got other areas of the city that are broken so I just want to finally acknowledge the mirror and I know this is a new process I thank you for the work you 've done in leading this process into your staff and I do think I really appreciate the fact that you have opened this up for a longer week of consultation given the significance of the document in front of us today Paul _"

    "text": "and put up on the board as well so I 'd like to commence the debate on the financial strategy and infrastructure strategy and the other documents upon which will base our consultation document so the consultation document is what will be going out to in the public arena that will be brought to counsel for sign off on the tenth of March the consultation document is what is designed to provide an effective basis for public participation in the decision-making process that we 're about to go through and so I just want to remind counselors that this is a step in a process which has still got a long way to go this is an important step because obviously signing off on the financial strategy and on the end on the infrastructure strategy and the underpinning documents is an important part of designing our consultation document because what we are required to do there is to highlight what are the significant and important issues and I think even as people have questioned today around the financial strategy and and asked questions around the infrastructure strategy we 're starting challenges that people are going to have to confront I just want to remind people about the change to the long-term plan process or to the local government act that was made at the well at the on the day that we were elected to office and and the specific change to the role of the mayor and in the in the legislation itself that says that without limiting the leadership role it is the role of the mayor to lead the development of the council 's plans policies and budgets for your consideration as counselors and so there is a completely different role it 's a different process then has been adopted in the past we haven 't had a consultation document process in the past and we also haven 't had the requirement to do a 30 year infrastructure strategy and I think that that the discipline that that has brought to the process has actually been extremely positive the whole purpose of the long-term plan is to describe the activities of the local authority to describe the community outcomes to provide integrated decision-making and coordination of the for the decisions and the activities of the local authority and to provide a basis for accountability of the local authority to the community so this is a beginning of a really important accountability process now clearly from the amendment that you can now see on screen that there are some the issues around with some councillors is that they didn 't resolve to to seek further savings missouri 's through the capital contribution to meet our funding shortfall I have to say that there has been a lot that has changed since when we consider the the financial strategy back in December to us considering these two documents in particular today and I think that those changes do require us to now make the commitment to set aside capital from our asset base in order to solve for them what I 've described is the worst case scenario I 'm sure that our financial officer wouldn 't necessarily agree with that that kind of tempting fate language but the truth is is that we have an obligation to do so but we also have an obligation to consult and councillor sitting around this table was absolutely committed to find savings within the capital program and are also committed to finding the kinds of savings within the organization that will help us solve for the financial shortfall that we know exists so I 'm I 'm I 've moved the resolution and the deputy mayor has seconded the resolution and I think that it 's really important that we focus on getting us that the consultation document out into the public arena and having a good quality engagement with the people of Christchurch about the significance of the challenges we face that the the trade-offs that exist and how we might seek to resolve those in the best interests of the city as a whole so who would like to take a cool ducky do you want to put your resolution up rather than a minute yep just in terms of this I think this does a whole range of things and I want to thank staff end castles for their hours that they have spent on a particular Peter and his team and what I like about your draft of eight point seven five and the smoothing that 's been worked through on this and I think we should actually know what that means because ultimately while we may be familiar with all of these sheets of paper what the pursuit of paper that people will get and take most pay most attention to is the sheet that arrives in the reitz envelope and so what does it mean at 8.75 means for the average price house which in Christchurch is now four hundred and forty-two thousand the current rates from the Christchurch City Council remembering that you get both rates from us and again as 2033 and an increase of 8.75 that goes to 2 to 10 Eakins rates are currently 308 and we 've expected an increase of save five point five percent from them which sounds likely their rates go to 325 the total rates which is what most people read and don 't bother to and break down goes from 2 3 4 12 25 36 or an overall increase of 8.3 percent so 25 36 and I think the really key thing that these think people will like 8.75 at all but i think it 's better than ten cent and i 'm happy to move the amendment but we appreciate that there are a range of causes for this huge burrowing in the past few years and loss of rating units of rating value which impacts on every other rate payer and the need to rebuild that rating base but mostly what we need to provide in a time like we face at the moment is some certainty that the counts will know what they 're doing that they have a financial plan and that they 're pressing the big green light and getting on with the rebuilding I think there 's some other things that it provides as well that I particularly like and because while I accept that local government has a lot to do with infrastructure it 's never just to do with infrastructure and I would always put people well above the infrastructure and so the infrastructure in terms of water sand storm water the three water 's are incredibly important and actually these documents Accord them a higher you travel but the infrastructure change that 's suggested in here all the way through is in the modal shift of the way in which we use our transport network so the spend on cycleways the spend on the accessible City which creates a central city busy I 'm sorry I 'm going to insist on the time limit so if you could just wrap up oh ok sorry I didn 't know that you did say that oh sorry I mean ok I thought I had its but the really key thing in this I think is the rebuilding of communities so in communities we 've gone ahead and you 'll see in the plans the rebuild of community centers of bishop dial turkeys some ordinary and Southwest library you 'll also see new poles apart from the eastern recreation and sports center you 'll see pulls at hornby and Linwood and to take account of what people have told us over and over again that they want to have a city that is about building communities not just streets and roads and that actually creates back for them so I 'll stop there thank you very much does anyone else want to speak are we how are we fixed with the amendment who we as the amendment is somebody 's gotta move so it 's been moved and seconded so we 're debating the amendments your chance of rain both we 're gonna deal with them both together so in terms of speaking time do we get three minutes on the amendment I three minutes on the substantial night no Nene we 're really trying to help Dave get out of the building I mean it 's the same as she Andrew okay so what we 're doing in this financial strategies attempting to balance the achievements of objectives with affordability and we 're balancing spending with the ability to fund that spending I guess making a domestic comparison attempting to balance the items on the shopping list with the amount of money left on the F postcard however there 's one aspect of the resolution we 've been asked to pass today again using a domestic budget an example which involves putting a for sale sign on to fund for spending in the budget is a big part of what 's proposed today and that 's the part of what 's proposed today that are not happy with them that i 'll be voting against and some of us compromised in December to allow a workable agreement to be reached but I 'm not prepared to go further than that today the narrative so far has been largely one of rates rises or asset sales to fill the funding gap but there is one option that hasn 't received so much airplay so far as the sale of assets and the raising of rates the conversation doesn 't just need to be about some the those two issues I 'd I advocate reducing the size of the shopping list reducing the size of the capital budget looking at timing and delivery of other anchor projects the operational expenditure looking for further savings in areas where projects can be deferred i 'm looking at nice to have projects projects which really could be done later or possibly even projects that don 't need to be done at all to spend on projects which are not capable have been delivered in the timeframe council in recent years has had large capital carryforwards in respect of capital projects that couldn 't be deferred in the time for implant if we take a realistic view a realistic view of what can be done when we may in fact realize that what we 're planning to do or what 's proposed is the further sale of assets to fund a program of work which is actually not capable have been delivered some of these decisions will be hard but also necessary we believe that we can find significant savings in the capital budget to cover the expected additional shortfall if there 's no further government contribution I want to hear what the public 's got to say about that through the consultation process and that 's the reason that I 'm supporting the amendment a further sale down of shares in the council own companies should also be a hard decision it 's a decision that 's harder for some than it is for others the dividends from these companies have historically would continue to do so the legacy issues of selling significant holdings and the council-owned company 's concerns me our ownership of Orion for example provides a level of resilience which private ownership couldn 't be guaranteed to provide our level of ownership of the two transport hubs of the port and the airport has ongoing strategic value for the city and the region I 'd stress that what 's past today assuming it is past is just a draft budget it 'll go out for consultation so that the people of Christchurch can tell us their priorities and we winded up yep I 've got some grave concerns about some of the contents in the document and I look forward to hearing what public 's got to say about this particularly with regard to the extreme level of asset sales proposed I again stressed that this is a draft document I want to hear what the public has got to say about this proposal and I look forward to the public response yani you thank you so you want to suggesting yeah thank you um so fundamentally we 're longest-serving city councillor who 's being here for a wee while I can recall post-earthquake dealing with some of the financial challenges in regards to our budgets and personally I didn 't vote for the cost agreement or those for a year unaudited plan because I thought that 800 million dollars being spent in the central city was unaffordable and I think actually we 're seeing that starting to come home now so really the choice and this draft long-term plan i believe is really about what can we afford to do and win and what should our priorities be enemy at a basic principle level it makes no sense to sell off things that raise money to put into things that lose money I think that will be over the long term a disaster for an economic disaster for our city so I think we have to look at what we do and win and if you look at the capital expenditure i think is perfectly reasonable to expect that we can find savings 250 million dollars are being proposed to be seen in this plan on central city have already had the earth make repairs done one street alone is the cost of a swing pool in our community kilmore straight about 16 million dollars on budget when it 's already been fixed so that 's the choice that we 're making today and I believe there are alternatives to either putting up rates or selling off SES and that is about how much money we want to spin and win so I 'm moving these resolutions to get to put on the table that actually two hundred million dollars of savings should satisfy the worst case scenario because not only are you having to borrow lease but you 've actually got more money to spend on other things if you so choose so we can defer things we can sew things the stadium is a classic the Prime Minister was in the paper the other day saying it 's our call it 's up to us ultimately when we want to build it and I 'm suggesting that we can put that out for three years because it isn 't a great priority for it fundamentally we I think that 's where our focus should be not on the debate about selling off assets but I 'm looking at where we 're spending money and making sure we 're putting it into the things that make a difference in people 's quality of life I don 't believe people will appreciate the fact that we 're selling off assets as part of our financial strategy in the short term for the grandchildren those grandchildren deserve to have the assets that we have to be able to keep rates lower over the long term so I urge you to support these amendments I think it 's important that there 's credible alternatives rather than the options that are input which is simply a trade-off between selling assets or raising rates support place to defer some of the capital expenditure Thank You Jimmy c 'mere yeah I supported this amendment the reason is we recall on fifth of assemble in the former council meeting with a thought only 500 and the 50 1,000,000 does only but right now you know we need to to add on another two hundred to the level of service pet treats and also release partial of the capital etc so the release effect or sell the additional insets HIV is not a unique way if we review the labor of service a moment still have a kind of the you know the most kept open for instance like Annie he mentioned earlier whether stadium is so urging or not we can defer defer to the 2025 still okay because I heard of a lot of the trooper dominate a moment we have aidan turner stadium is okay and they feel good is now so algae and maybe some of an other electrode which they can consider can you know is a nice to have can be full or even to Kansas attorneys alternative in otherwise us a moment here have a some uncertainty for instant I the Family Contribution it is still possible you based on the principle bacterial karma contributor for Toronto infrastructure in four hundred million dollars show four we copy the council can cater the 240 million dollars they committed this show for for the 200 minute others absolutely it is you consider maybe still consider hundred million dollars still possible all these kind of uncertainty can make that happen we cannot assume is not can make it happen now this we need to the more can come can consider in other ways has elected members counselor I always thought I 'm the public servant who is outer the boss who is our master actually is a great hair they are a master we need to take a poodle way now that we all there we have to make a decision or assume we have to you know to to sell additional 200 minute other we need to let the public letter they 've helped fake back to us I think there 's a proper way so this way a sub support amendment thank you they fell um I 'm not I 'm not wolf I 'm worried exceed that the Standing Orders I would allow for the three-minute speakers and I wasn 't going to have a limit on it I 'm also fine if anybody wants to speak against the two to step back and and I 'll speak we haven 't the standing order says three aside and you know we 've had three speaker I 'm I 'm trying to assess this process so i 'm going to call though thank you the decisions we make today don 't only impact on this team the whole 10 year plan as has been indicated we 're looking at least 30 years our pet to get our city effects that 's why it 's so important people 's choice counselors have agreed to a sensible selling down of up to five hundred fifty-one million dollars but the thing is in terms of exceeding that by another 200 million is really like as concert una seed it 's it 's in fact going to sell off at least half of your family home when in fact you you know that there are potential cost savings which we as a council will consider and so and we know for example that our council does have a history like every other council in the country of beggar under spins potentially again saving hundreds of millions of dollars the one that was pointed that in the kept in the capital plan there 's a 150 million dollars budget of four in fact with this potentially using those government funds we could we could end up say so only spending up to 50 million dollars drawing so that will be one-third investment by us and subsidies of up to 100 million dollars from government so we need to take though things into account well before we start selling off further se it 's so I 'm saying that I certainly support the amendments particularly because I think they 're basically based on common sense thank you thank you Pauline and then Ben sorry I 'll just very quickly to I support the amendment and I am concerned as are the rest of people in Christchurch proposed s it sales about when the loss of the dividends resulting from the sell-down of area sets will cause a rate rise in the future since we 're using that realized capital to pay for earthquake recovery in renewal we 're not putting it in the bank to use the interest to offset rates and the other thing we can 't use those foods up to when we know that we 've got so many unknowns then we may well probably will not need that money all of it so I 'm struggling with it and for that reason I can 't support it Thank you Thank You Glenn thank you i 'll go as fast as i can and i encourage all our colleagues to speak I think our constituents would want to hear our views on such a critical matter my view on this is that as people 's choice as a group we 've been actually quite reasonable we did stretch things beyond really what we would normally stretch them and on December the 5th we conceded a lot and I think we were quite reasonable net we the council was described as reaching a new level of maturity at the time but now calling on another 200 million for me is a bridge too far the I have two questions in relation to this and the first is that I do support the amendment I think of our own experience here in bill would and other conditions is a good example of a project that will blow out over time and money because you 're dealing with so many unknowns i also want to refer to table to page 22 it talks about the external sources of funding we refers to clear a national disaster following the quakes requiring a national response which we have received and we 're very grateful for that we 're being asked today to solve a financial problem which in my view appeals to both the ratepayer and the taxpayer base as part of this I noticed from the written consent meeting the other day that to date over three years following the quakes the value of consents over this time is 5.8 billion now I know it doesn 't work exactly like that but if you do go for a straight fifteen percent GST take on that that is 817 million in GST what 's happening to that as counselors gothic me and mandy have referred to in the past publicly what is happening to that money so i 'm fully supportive of this amendment here and i and i 'm also looking for a two-way street with a crown thank you alright alright so i 'll just simply conclude by saying that we 've you know we 've got a long way to go and I want to congratulate counselors for taking such a mature approach I know that these are challenging issues they 're going to be challenging for the people of Christchurch as well but I think we 're up for the conversation and the debate will be robust and you know I really do congratulate people for Walden it 's too late now sorry I look to reckoned sorry no well well okay yeah all right you can replace me I mean I 'm just going to say that we support the mezz recommendation actually all the concerns that people 's choice have raised in this recommendation terms of reviewing capital expenditure and I would point out we 've been through an activity management plan process where we didn 't cut enough expenditure we 've been through the capital program review in November where they added to it so I 'm quite pleased to I think you know it 's a good recommendation will go out and have a conversation with the public and see what their feedback is very good right so I 'm going to I 'm going rule on the amendment so the the first paragraph of the amendment I 'm going to rule out of order and I 'm going to rule the last paragraph out of order as well so if we can have the words delete six point one point three and replace with moved up to above the paragraph that remains that enables the amendment to be put explain waiver all those other tea out of it I 've ruled the modifying of the capital works program about deferring the stadium because that would require the agreement of central government and under the cost share agreement it requires the agreement of central government I thought the prime minister 's comments were very helpful in the paper but they do not form an amendment to an agreement the last one is ruled out of order because the Audit Office has made it crystal clear and I sat on crystal clear that they will not take savings to be found as a mechanism for solving for the budget now this doesn 't mean that we are going to be selling an extra two hundred million dollars worth of our assets it simply means that if we are required to do so we have it on our books that we will do so and that gives the Audit Office the assurance that they need so we 're not going to be selling anything that doesn 't need to be sold so can I put that first and I think could you bring up the screen so i 'll put the amendment those in favor of the amendment will vote yes and those who opposed to the amendment will vote no and the amendment is lost so therefore i will put the resolution as it stands on a mended and i will and again if you could put up the things if you 're in favor of the resolution press yes and if you 're opposed to a press know yep by doing it as an amendment that 's that 's so we have a basis for formulating our consultation for going up for consultation with the people of Christchurch on the long-term plan so thank you all very very much I I I think we 'll a resolve to go into public excluded now because we 'll come back it at two o 'clock just to finish that one other item of business so I 'll move that we go under public excluded for the reasons set out in the agenda seeking to bottom scandrett i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "thought you 're off the hot didn 't you know in fact I might start with having received a letter from simpson grace and now just updating you on what that song okay thank you have it off and so they 've looked at it under section 101 a whether it complies the draft financial strategy of the government local government act 2002 and the key paragraph paragraph or on the spaces and our Pena the strategy addresses all the requirements of section 101 a but with the reservation about compliance with section etc particularly in relation to the subsidiaries of christchurch city holdings limited although important in the context of the proposals for the release of capital this is a relatively minor matter to rectify by additional wedding and the table of council investments similarly we might have expected a clearer statement of the impact of capital release on current rate levels so those were the only SPX that they wanted us and i see them as technical and so you written you could fix those with with that advice that 's right yeah under the and the reinvention I may the first one relates to that clause that we 've just been talking about their six point one point five this clause is obviously intended to relate to technical aspects only what do you see the scope of that being and what 's an examine we 've just had an example of where it would be used how far-reaching could that clause be in terms of making changes after this meeting I think that 's a very good question and one I don 't have a clear answer to because the resolution might also say something like non-material but again you 'll say into the same definitional SP so what is non material it really is in my mind to align things such as engineering infrastructure strategy may not be inflated and need in order office say that needs to be the exact same figures is in the financial strategy so you need to update in review and they might come and assess a accounting policy treatment or a starting or closing position that is slightly out and we need to roll that through to the extent that numbers and all the flow-through for all of the documents of which there are around 2,000 pages will need to be reviewed rechecked and redone so it 's those type of aspects but they are in my mind technical and mechanical not material but it 's very difficult to put a definition around there but a classic one would be the example that you 've just given which would be the legal advice which may in fact be backed up by the audit office that we need to have a little bit more information than financial strategy about the flow on impact of selling assets on the on the income of the council that is exactly right yeah okay thank you and the second question just having to drill down into the 398 million which is noted on page 11 and I certainly take the comments that David Adamson is made already in regard to that that figure comes out of the three year plan has this figure not a not been able to be updated further as a result of you know changed expectations since the three year plan level of certainty is there around that and you know where does that says if there isn 't the certainty why isn 't there and could something be done to firm it up a little bit so I 'd refer you to page five of the the financial strategy or page 11 of the agenda of the council agenda and the second paragraph under capital expenditure so what we 're talking to in this space is that uncertainty and where the 398 has come from and the the requirement for us at this point in time with the base of knowledge to use the information we have available so what we are saying is we 've provided a further 398 of costs associated with the horizontal infrastructure program the final cost of which will become known ones independent system is released later this year this will then need to be discussed with the crown so it has clearly stated at the level of required horizontal infrastructure spend is a key uncertainty and so it is the key uncertainty we don 't know at this point and it also clarifies what the level of spenders higher-than-expected higher than what the base position was and the removal of the 398 savings to be found then the impact to ratepayers is a quarter of a percent increase in reigns over two years for every 10 ml of additional borrowing that 's required for that and so it 's I guess all I 'm doing is reinforcing the discussion that we 've already had from on on the infrastructure strategy and with David around the uncertainty in this space we just don 't know we have to go with the information we have and as things become clearer will know the implications and given the need for certainty in other areas is the auditor comfortable with that level of uncertainty in this area because we were using the best information we can and we 're clearly stating the uncertainty and the implication of that uncertainty and we have funding for that additional 398 the extent that we get there via comfortable with that position yep yanny although I wouldn 't like to speak on their behalf I must say I 'm not here as but I think the language that was used the best info we had I just I 'm struggling to understand how the best to employ we can have is like two to three years out of day surely we have updated figures on that 398 I think this is revisiting the discussion you 've already had on the horizontal infrastructure so I just I can 't_''_360.63 you know I just can 't cover it in there I 'm sorry but um so that 's that so we used the 398 notice check when we had the informal we asked for some alternative options to be included and in the financial strategy there 's no with under on five page 15 you assume that is seventeen percent rates increase if we don 't release 750 from cchr likewise an option BUSM thirty-seven percent rate increase but there 's no mention of deferring capital expenditure which was one things we asked for so have you done any work on those alternative options and can we get some alternate options in here that actually are credible in terms of the combination levers that ask for a option to be produced around Capitol release I need specificity on the capital that will be released the time frame the profile in the program the reason for that as we 've discussed both in the financial strategy and infrastructure strategy as the inter linkages between all of the leaders in particular with in the capital program the asset management plans the levels of service that are being created the operational expense the depreciation expense they all net to what particular capital asset as deferred or delayed and for example if it was a pool that wasn 't being built then it might have differential implications on our PEX as opposed to if it was pipes it wasn 't repaired and I would I would refer you through to the deferred renewals section of the financial strategy which also talks about our extent to the for renewals has been decreased because of the large increase and repair costs and operating costs if we pull it back too far so I it sounds like an easy request but unless I have specificity around the profile of the capital profile can 't_''_489.39 be deferred would need to be removed I cannot run that scenario what I have been able to do with these scenarios is point out at under certain circumstances if you are reducing the capital release lever then you need to increase the rates leader it 's um it 's just that entering relationship I think there 's for the purposes of this and I thank the resolution that I 've put up you know requires us to revisit the capital program and I and and we will be you know essentially doing that I think the timing of this Peter was that last year when we looked at the financial strategy beginning of december we didn 't really well i can speak for myself I didn 't have a clear understanding that we had to solve 40 so being in the position where that is now clearly understood we perhaps would have looked at the capital program with a slightly different lens if we 'd known that we were solving 40 so that you know that this isn 't the end of the line and I is a process where we go out to consult with our communities they might have some views about taking things off the capital program that we will need to take into account so all of these things will be gone through with a fine-tooth comb but what Peter 's saying is is that he can 't legally put something in a document as savings to be found and we 've just had a conversation about the last person who put 398 million dollars on our budget as savings to be found yani it 's no different than the argument of releasing 750 capital from CC HL we don 't know which companies is coming from we don 't know what percentages or what we can get when we go that 's right and oh you know that we can confirm that we are obtaining that money that 's what we 're confirming that we are going out for so I mean that is completely different from saying that we will save money that we won 't spend money that we 've already put on the budget so look I mean you can raise it and debate if you want to but I 'm not going to debate it and questions have you got another question thanks um so we also asked on page for that it was made explicit the cost of the Inca projects for the total project costs to councils including highlighting the ongoing operational and and etc so we haven 't had an updated table on to see which which to understand what the costs are what there 's something is up so the projects that we want to add it to that list and they were also getting the trick off so that the community could make informed submissions so when can we get their information then can we include that in here so you 're asking around the section to see on page four in those specific activities okay and you want them separated out from the current depreciation usage life operational costs that we do from every single asset within the council business yeah I do believe in most of their information is already contained within the documents that have been sent to you depending on who owns it would have an impact on depreciation and operation yeah which means which you 've already heard Peter say that for the purposes of planning we 've assumed as in private ownership with council operations so it is that that 's the assumption that 's been made for planning purposes if they 're changes and it will be known by the time we get to the end of this process we will know who owns it because it will be open okay final question for me is in regards to the stadium but it 's on the budget currently in the budget and the year 2022 so what 's the impact of having met under 25 26 yeah because my understeering was that that 's what we asked for that it well we 've got to build it if we 're going to have it operating on the 25 26 years so we start building it and preparing for building it on 2022 as mine explaining the rationale previously was to put the budget out by 10 years no not really yeah but it 's the move the capital expenditure to beyond doubt our you know sort of red zone to use a phrase that 's popular here time frame so it 's to move the capital expenditure out and that op X doesn 't start took 20 25 26 that right that sounds right without referring back to the documents so but in terms of financial benefit moving it three years and putting it into 25 26 to start up later that 's got what sort of it I couldn 't tell you off the top of my head and that would be the stadium starting obviously in 2028 that wasn 't a request that was put to me right but we we don 't have any certainty because of the business case around there anyway so this okay I mean bits that i mean i think that that 's not relevant to the to this jimmy and in film one question on page is 31 the table forecast dividend income all and be no because still concerned is so figure evil in 2015-16 if a council release or partial capital for 514 I ponders it in two thousand sixteen and seventeen the council release for another two hundred million dollars they were dividend job to the 25 million dollars then you will compare the other ear 2017-18 it will be only twenty-three point six million dollars our party concerned our main purpose it will release of the partial pepto try to seek in the strategic partners to increase the productivity along in the pieces more effectively and more efficiently but looks like tourist activity is not increased a lot o a lipid trata so this candle trend were increase the repairs the burden rather than is a burden is my particular cancer so i 'm not sure where these that forecast a figure come from okay quite a detailed Christian society ox the big releases in 15 16 and 16 17 obviously other five 49.3 in the 200 point nine that occludin the footnotes below so those are the if the proposal goes through to sell that is the sale of those those aspects of it that impacts upon the dividend streams which then flows through as you have noted those cans those dividend CC HL and they are necessarily because of that point do not include any potential uplift or upside from strategic partners driving greater dividends or value through that would be an upside potential and we can 't model that for conservatism purposes the last point was around this creates rather than eases the burden on on ratepayers I think that 's that 's something that is probably more of a qualitative assessment on ratepayers themselves it is detail in here around the returns that we currently get in with respect to dividends which is around say a three percent level versus the I think it 's eight to nine percent we talked about as being the the return from those assets including a capital increase so those are the aspects that you then into trade with the the reduction and the debt and paying the interest costs on the debt of say around six percent so that 's probably I think the three elements of the question but we will get if we do have a strategic partner that takes over or take it takes up with a shareholding with then that will flow on and to those figures to increase them that 's right yeah Phil Peter I just want to ask you about the saturday insurance assumption likely to this some big assumptions around the future cable program which council to look at and the review of the horizontal infrastructure and I I 'm aware clearly there 's sensitivity around the issue of insurance but my understanding is that that it I just wanted to scarify but in fact we 've in effect had to build into our our own costings any any future insurance payments that council would receive in addition to what we 've already received said the case okay let me talk as much as I can about insurance and apologies if I don 't go too far down the track I leave the question unfulfilled because of the back of my mind be realizing that insurers will be looking at this and the position we have reached with ordered office around assumptions on insurance have been approved by audit was been quite a lot of time with them it 's been based on our may or may not be out I don 't probably don 't want to go any further than that we do have within the plan assumptions of further receipts what I don 't want to talk to is whether there 's any expectation that there might be a short for or shortfall amount around that but Audit Office and ourselves comfortable that what we have in there represents a similar to the last question a fear but necessarily conservative view of insurance receipts going forward obviously insurance receipts and totality will only be resolved through negotiation litigation resolution with insurers over time and even the profile and the timing and receipt of that is not something that we can unilaterally decide upon so our financial position will improve in fact those that conservative position as as if we do better than currently in the plan yes yep cuz so Peter just for me to clarify no i don 't i really don 't want anymore no it wasn 't it was just what some in the failures i 'm assuming from what Peter see that in fact there is it talk about what we 've got in the figures in fact with respect to what we are going to be saying about insurance and it will necessarily be opaque within the financial statements even if it means a an audit audit will raise a meta against that because to be specific on the receipts or potential of the of any outcome would would certainly undercut us and negotiation yeah yeah so we think we 're going to be very opaque on the numbers thank you alright so the that the question is now as whether we debate the financial strategy now or should we break for lunch we 've got turn councillor recess has to leave so i would suggest we get on and debate yeah sure okay well look we will just have a five minute break and we will debate it in five minutes yep _"

    "text": "levels of service page 19 is it it oh it 's the assumptions and financial risks roads and footpaths the page 32 its wastewater sorry section 6 that 's around of financial if somebody goes from the portrait vision and give the correct numbers on this one so girly so that we can to the right page yep thank you it won 't take long yep sorry yonni well it 's okay that 's I Stuart bandit assumptions on is it roads and footpaths yes I 've got that it 's page 28 the days on the run very good yeah so just obviously accessible City Transport project is now gone up to 250 million so I think it needs to be some some coming on there can you can you advise way by this is one line one but it 's not 250 in the CD so the numbers in front you there on page 28 is the 2014 dollar value but there has since been adjusted to 2015 dollar values and also a bit obviously there is still on there 's ongoing work with an accessible City this at that time as I say since their time numbers have been adjusted to 2015 values for for the LTP ok so there 's also talk there about this short fall from the crown and that 's obviously gone up as well what do we have a total figure for those financial risks and assumptions now that we are doing what and if so what is it we don 't have that number at this stage that the review of the cost sharing agreement is under way but it 's just that I thought for the auditor-general we have to allow for the worst-case scenario on these breasts and assumptions so we must have a figure that we 've put into our financial strategy well we 're not including two hundred million dollars in our financial strategy based on the resolution that I 've put to the meeting so the earth it yes it 's not the shortcut it 's not the shortfall from the crown that I 'm interested it 's what is the total cost of these assumptions and financial risks as per the updated numbers that that it 's the crown shortfalls at the skirt short call or all those other issues I just want the total number that that 's under putting our financial strategy they 've been inflation-adjusted really are they inflation adjusted now there 's a difference between two 2014 sorry I don 't know which projects you were referring to there yeah neither so um here 's a really good one but we know that skirt aren 't going to do the second sealing on the roads so they 've we 've got roads that haven 't got a second seal that are going to be need extra expenditure and that 's 40 1.9 million so you know that 's that 's applying to the for ads and city more on high street yeah but we 're we 're awaiting the outcome of the horizontal infrastructure abuse so sir we 'll know the results of their time but by the time we you know get to the final point on this I wouldn 't okay worry too much about it now I mean we 've just I don 't know actually that the and footpaths sorry I 'm gonna cause up I was going to raise that question as well I mean I just don 't believe the same general would sign off on on those assumptions if they 're not correct it 's just that because i think that the public expectation is that you know that will be you know putting back better than what was there before but in fact what it actually says is that we won 't be meeting pre-earthquake levels when we 've completed the work and that 's that that was of concern obviously to me and will be but something I here we go at some page 25 on the on the landscape vision earthquake legacy and levels of service the initial phases of repair replacement of the simple structure so this is roads and footpaths as a priority for recovery and is expected to be completed by skirting 2016 however in many instances even once the network is reinstated it will not be to the same standard as was typical prior to the earthquakes and it will be approximately 30 years before the whole has assumed that some of the roading will remain operational and the residential red zone network as well so I think that that will be a surprise to a lot of people when Christ judge that the scoop program isn 't going to deliver back to pre equate levels because the phrase you know 21st century resilient City build back better you know all of these phrases have been really captured and I mean from many sources so but we 're really going out there now and saying to the public that for the next 30 years that ain 't going to be like it was that was an odd said not it from the end of the table I take it Dave Stewart and yeah you know no I mean I 'm not I 'm not being critical in fact I 'll make sure you really pleased that we 're surfacing if that 's the right word if not resurfacing the issues that the public have got to really focus on in terms of the debate that we 're going to have around the consultation document so this is the way that the consultation document has put together so I 'm actually really grateful that it 's been presented in such a clear way so the question okay oh no no no no no no but it but the double the double surfacing issue is one that 's that is definitely the case and the issue with the double surfacing as I understand it is that if you don 't double surface your bet they 're repairing a lot more quickly than you would be otherwise but i think the figure i was trying to get to was what is the total estimated assumed cost of the infrastructure repair from the earthquake to the standard that we that we choose which is the decent standard not the lower standard that you would do in a modern city so what we we must know with all the infrastructure stuff we 've done in all the girls do we have a current estimate because obviously in the three year plan it was identified as 398 million and that this is a question i guess that 's going to go to Peter 398 million was our best estimates but it was forward-looking so what does that figure today as at 398 million still or a still operating off that because that 's what we 've put on budget yeah right so that 's the 398 difference yeah an actual fact original estimate of time of the damage was 3.7 billion so now we 've come back that we believe that probably that about three billion is enough to cover all the work if you took our plan drainage now and drainage is a different issue because your destruction necessarily hasn 't been broken as much but there 's an infrastructure plan that 's the big uncertainty know what parts of the city more than a meter yeah no no I I do understand that but I think that again you you 've touched on another important point that because the city took on a program of naturalization around some of its land drainage we don 't have in pipes what what other studies would have in pipes and and so therefore the expectation that there would be a cost sharing arrangement around affected unto the scoop program for that reason yep that 's right so with Terrell alone but a long way to go yet the total estimated cost of the total skirt repair or infrastructure appear is sitting at what I just think in terms of going out to consult with a public I think it 's really important that we tell them it if we just do the kind of lower standards up in it yeah I understand what you 're saying that is the cost we do it we 're going to obviously develop a consultation document that has to be crystal clear around there I think that the the uncertainty that sits around here is the timing so if the horizontal infrastructure independent review had been completed in the time frame that had been anticipated by the cashier agreement we would know what those numbers were so you know we are a little bit punching in the dark but you know by the time we get to the consultation document on the tenth of 10th or whatever March we will we will I think have a bit of me as um when we were developing the infrastructure strategy we were given what i thought was really useful was a road optimization met that showed what what roads were going to be fixed and which ones weren 't i think it 'd be incredibly important to have maps and hear that show the proposed work and the different options so um why why haven 't those maps been attached and can we attach those met so people can see really clearly what what the current think that 's unfair because the scoot optimization process is has not that has not been allowed four and this infrastructure strategy is from on page 28 it says no allowance is made for skirts optimization process and it 's assumed that their program of works is that November 2013 will be completed as planned I just think that it would be unfair to go out and say that a particular outcome will be the long-term outcome of what we agree to as a counselor to show you what 's been hearing some roads I 'm with respect we had a really clear I we got which showed here 's the different standards or appear as choices that you have to make and it had photographs of the footpaths that would be repaired footpaths that wouldn 't roads that would be repaired yes I think I kind of met I think that I my intervention before I think was designed to be helpful rather than combative that the the issue is is that we went through a presentation on more than one presentation on the effects of the optimization process that was to keep the expenditure for skirt projects within the budget agreed on the cost share agreement for going beyond the cost share agreement it requires the independent review to be completed and then for further negotiations to occur between the council and the crown so I don 't think it 's actually it 's it 's less than it 's not fair it 's actually not accurate to put out information in the public arena that may or may not be the ultimate decision that the council makes and remember that the only issue that the that the cost share agreement deals the decisions that we have to make as a council over the next 30 years and that 's made crystal clear for the first time by an infrastructure strategy that covers 30 years to be able to see what 's going to happen in terms of infrastructure appear in win and we haven 't agreed what will happen we actually need we have imperfect information you know I mean I did have a suggestion of wee while ago about delaying this year for a bit but there wasn 't to happen and we 're in the position that we run we have imperfect information we don 't know what the results of the independent review will be we don 't know the true costs of the land drainage recovery program and what contribution might be coming our way with regard to that we don 't know about contributions in terms of psycho ways and don 't know about our insurance recoveries I would say that this makes our position very challenging but there is puts a greater onus on us as a council to provide the leadership that the city to the decision-making process despite those uncertainties Phil um Chris I just love this last night so I 'm sorry I heaven death come to you on this but the only on page 28 with the assumptions again the second last bullet point is that accessible city projects Anton that included so like does that include does it actually include the second phase projects for example like cool ministry and in fact they 're not part of this or could you just clarify that the intention of this section is to just clearly eight detail what has been excluded from from the numbers of the back that doesn 't necessarily mean to say those things are excluded from the LTP or anywhere else is is to put into context in terms of the assessments me we 've made and the financial graphs that you 're seeing there what is and isn 't included in those because at the time that we put this we began putting this document together those numbers were were not firm they were not fixed and they were they were changing so we we 've had detailed what assumptions we 've made what things are excluded from the assessment there 's in for the things that are included in those financial crafts but it 's not intended to be an exact estimate of what those exclusions may or may not cost is just to to detail for you or for any other reader of this what isn 't what is in those numbers at this stage the motion we head at this stage but in fact some of these will be an errand that for in the financials for the capital program I with respect to accessible cities the capital program planned capital program does outline what those accessible city capital expenditures are at age 2 30 something from memory thanks be a week were able to move on to the financial strategy now or are there more questions on the infrastructure strategy Jemaine green to two questions regarding to the infrastructure strategy on page 19 the AC management information system the improvement resilience because I 'm still concerned regarding to the task of paragraph Council the network modeling a moment still call you now you of big impact regarding to all of infrastructure strategy de especially for the cost estimate have any impact not up to now whether we overestimate or underestimate from page 19 that 's kuvira no this one in for chacha strategy ask a pilgrim yes 4.4 ya missed it is a bigger gay or not in terms of the estimates are provided from the asset management information system yes modeling modeling I 'll keep your up to us quickly other models are only based on office that so area management information system contains a whole lot of information about the wedding when assets were put into the ground what the latest conditioner systems assessment of them might show and so on that 's then put in two models to say well on the basis of for example a life or say 80 years for an S asbestos cement asbestos concrete point cement pipe looking at the age my age profilin network that we have when do we think we 're going to have to start replacing that and that builds up the financial Prosise profile so that it is based on those expected life of those assets is based on some assumptions around their existing condition but it is a is pretty much what is used across the country in terms of long-term estimates of what you may need to provide in dollar terms to make sure your network stays in good condition but that information is all in our asset management information system and that supplies the various models that we use to to predict when things will need to be replaced or predict when things will need to be extended to to service new subdivisions or new development and the whole the whole lot is put together to form up those financial estimates so yes there is a there is a plus or minus figure to those because it 's only basically determine body the assumptions we make in that model but it 's based on historical evidence of those pipes lasting that number of years that is constantly being refined so older amenda a stir me those the cost is reasonable it 's under control in terms of the cost estimates that are applied to replacing those things go at that period of time not necessarily the immediate market because that is obviously being influenced by the rebuilt and so we 're taking information from previous contracts where conduct costs st indices may go and where we think the market may be in five or six years time when when hopefully the marqués settled down to a more stable nature in terms of what 's been applied here but we 've taken all of those and then we 've applied rates to each particular type of work to to extrapolate out to the overall program thank you clean you can thank you Jimmy thank you my question is about the percentage of underground and ruptured that has been replaced already we gotta figure on since the September quits oh don 't forget supported through the infrastructure you 'll see you this is looking forward not backwards so it 's it 's in that thank you it 's in the monthly report to to that your committee yes na yeah okay my second question related to that is and obviously we have to do this we have to look about page 30 their talks about the from year 11 onwards it increases to allow the deferred works and other long-term issues my question is that given that my understanding is through the underground infrastructure held up half of the September quake I rather up I 'll start again the infrastructure that was replaced after the September quake held up in Hebron yep so what are the projected savings given now the greater resilience in terms of future renewals so what in terms of future renewals what we 've we 've done some work through skirt in terms of what impact we believe the earthquakes had of the residual life of the pipes that weren 't directly affected by the earthquake from I 've had some nightlife not after them and they 're that they 're the same lies we put into the models and the the quantum of our networks they 're actually going to be replaced through this don 't significantly obviously the stuff that has been replaced that greater resilience has been has been provided through the stuff that has been replaced but bear in mind a total replacement is repairs or lining and and other techniques they 've used to put the stuff back into into service so it doesn 't have a significant impact in terms of looking at the 30 year horizon and just because of the percentage of stuff that has been totally renewed is relatively low I just I want to sort of kind of conclude this on pages 11 and 12 so enter to tie affordability and level of service to resilience so the statement here that our constrained financial position has reduced our ability to deliver pre youthquake levels of service and this is likely to be the case for many years we need to establish an appropriate balance between expenditure required to accommodate growth and obviously the growth is out for south southwest and the asset renewal cost to restore levels of service so it is a balancing act but that 's something that we really do need to draw to the to the public 's attention when we go out to consult isn 't it and the link for me is with the resilience component over on page the scope of works now included limits repairs to critical defects assets only which as some areas will provide a network which is much less resilient to future earthquake Abby so not that i 'm wishing anything to kind of happen and touching what every time i say that but the there is a link there isn 't there around and that 's something that we really do need to ask the people of Christchurch if thou prepared to make that that well with though if they want to invest and resilience they have to invest up front now rather than hold it off over a period of time but there 's a cost to do that at the same time as we 're trying to manage for growth and areas that perhaps we weren 't anticipating such a high level of growth and such a short space of time that 's correct I 'm an overall obviously through the refill resilience has been built in where it can be for the critical things things like well heads things that suffered a lot of damage so they are more resilient are far more resilient for a future of empire costs would have prohibited providing that sort of level of resilience over the whole of our network yeah yeah so it 's a it 's a finally judged balancing act that 's great thank you so now we 'll move on to the financial strategy _"

    "text": "moving back towards financial resilience and being prudent as required under the Act there that the fourth Keystone 's we 've gone back to if I turn to the levers the Thunder levers we had in particular starting at the bottom of page nine the first lever we talked to with them the body of the reporters around the capital release and the comment there to access sufficient funds to meet expenditure requirements while at the same time complying with their need for prudence potential resilience and intergenerational equity the decision was made to consult on selling part of the investment portfolio held by CC atl so that 's the first level lever there what i wanted to point out is that the process of this is as important in my opinion is the potential quantum and that is set out on page 10 and is also referenced i 've noted in the news recommendation as well from about the third paragraph down as the description around the process that would be followed in the proposed rates increases at the bottom of page 10 they are looking to set rates limits and hold rate increases over the next three years as low as practical practicable given the balance that is required that 's looking to stay with unsustainable limits the graphs that follow on page 12 to 14 showed the profile of the proposed solution across the various aspects of rates over the 30-year profile our borrowing projected debt would move the impacts on projected net debt to revenue ratio and one element that goes to affordability which is a net interest to rates ratio as well as providing a recommendation they are alternative options which is shown as well the purpose of the alternative options is to show what happens with deaf combinations of pulling on the various funding levers and those are shown static from page 15 they 're a reasonable subset of how the funding levers can be pulled but obviously there 's a myriad of options available within any one of those the main aspects that have been looked at is if there were less asset sales what is the impact on the other levers such as high rates if there were higher rates how would so that the financial resilience SB I don 't tend to go through the alternative options they are there for information and also to be to be considered I wanted to talk about section sex and quantified limits just to avoid confusion around it one of the legislative requirements for us is to produce quantified limits on rates rates increases and borrowings and it follows a distinct definition and requirement under the Act as such it can look like it doesn 't match with the other rates increases that we 've put through for existing ratepayers so to be non confused I would suggest that people look at the previous rates figures rather than the quantified limits quantified limits allow the benchmarks to be done by government across the industry but they will be confusing for current rate payers and my final summary point is to look at the graph on page 20 which even since published is now out of date with Wellington having resolved to consult last night on their rates increases we 've had a very preliminary look at what that would do to the Wellington profile engine ending at exactly the same point as we are and so we will have to update the information around that and we intend to as further councils come out what this graph is showing is that we are moving through from being very low against an inch marks through to meddle and about them the plan and what will show is the same as all conditio orphan but above the others and I think that 's a point that is worth considering and noting as we work through consideration of the financial strategy I 'll now pass over to Chris Gregory for a quick run-through on the infrastructure strategy thank you thank you Peter and as Peter mentions the infrastructure strategy is a new document for Council it came about as part of the legislation changes at six months ago previously we were required to have asset management plans for each individual asset group now under that legislation change we 're required to provide this 30-year view of five items or five core items of infrastructure being the three water 's water supply wastewater and stormwater we 're also and protection works and roads and footpaths so they are that the five areas that are specified and legislation have to be covered by this document and so that is why there is nothing but that 's why there has focused on what is seen as the core assets for council in terms of infrastructure it links to the asset management pens that underpin those particular asset groups so there are still asset management plans for all asset groups including these five and this document is a is really a summary of the things that are being coming to the fore in those individual asset management plans so there 's the linkage in terms of the detailed asset management and planning coming into this document as a summary document giving a high-level overview for Council of those core SF groups previously asset management plans have only been required to cover 10 years this one is required to cover 30 years so we 're looking out to 2045 and that does bring in a whole new set of parameters in terms of looking that far are the things that we 've it looks at what 's needed for that infrastructure and tries to paint a picture of the challenges issues and risks that are facing council over that time frame for this particular document it 's not just the normal day-to-day infrastructure issues that you would expect in terms of capacity for growth and so on we 've had some obviously some unique things that we 've had to take account in here and they 're identified within the document in terms of earthquake legacy the new built environment the residual condition of the networks and so on and a period of time that it 's going to take to completely rebuild the city climate change is going to come in is going to start to impact over this period too that 's nearly that 's an emerging issue that 's identified and document urban development and the lerp and what the lerp has done in terms of the growth and resettlement patterns for Christchurch so while we have the loop we 've had to make some assumptions in here in terms of providing infrastructure to support that resettlement and growth be provided as identified through the the models that the teams run to predict where that growth might happen and what infrastructure is needed to support it and the last point and I 'll come back to this a bit later in a couple of minutes is aging infrastructure we are faced with the fact that in the 50s and 70s there were big 1950s and 1970s not 2050 and 2070 there were big building booms christ church group quite a lot as did what a lot of new zealand through that period a lot of the infrastructure that was put in to support that growth is now coming to the end of its life a model infrastructure has lives expected lives of 80 to 100 years some a little bit less than that and that 's coming to its end of its life but against the end of its life like any asset the only option is to basically replace it because it is far more expensive to just keep trying to maintain it and patch it it comes to the point where we have to replace pipes or that 's an issue that is really highlighted through this document so in terms of the document itself it 's what in several sections those sections the front end and these sections have been sort of have been highlighted to us through that the auditor general 's office they 've given some guidance about the sort of things that they would expect an infrastructure strategy to to cover and we followed that guidance in the layout of this document so you will see as you read it there 's the background to the district these communities and so on section 2 then goes on to describe what infrastructure we actually have this covered by this document so how many kilometers of pipe etc 3 provides the context around the linkage of this document to the other documents and as pete has already said this is a core document to support the financial strategy it will link to the asset management hands and the activity management plans the consultation document and the significance policy so the whole lock form a group of linked documents that in effect provide the LTP and section 4 is about councils strategic direction in terms of community outcomes and the linkages that that are provided for in the asset management plans by this approach to infrastructure and how it will support those community outcomes then 5 goes on to describe in more detail for each of the asset preserve some of those issues that are facing infrastructure over 30 year period so things I mentioned before in terms of climate change etc how those issues are going to impact the individual groups of assets such as water or flood control and finally section six is the financials and if I can refer you to page page 33 there 's three so the financial section section six there 's a summary graph on page 33 and there 's some summary graphs in that section six for each of the asset groups talked about that 's page 29 if you lived in a landscape version document page 33 in the portrait version document there are two appendices the first one is quite a should know that the first appendix Appendix A is the detail of the financials for 've also included in pendeks be a costume plated version of that showing the inflation over the full 30 year period we decided to do both of those because if we applied if the inflation to that the numbers 90 provide those then you can 't see the trends in terms of increased kilometers or pipes and so on and so forth that 's the reason for the two appendices but Appendix B really gives alignment to the financial strategy in terms of the cost inflated numbers so just returning quickly to the graph on page 33 you 'll see there towards the end of this ten-year plan that costs the capital requirement increases quite significantly the reasoning or the reason for that is this aging infrastructure I talked about we have a huge increase in the amount of pipe network that we estimate will need to be replaced from about 20-25 onwards and that is ongoing for several years as those waves of development come from the 50s and 60s come through 22 requiring replacement in that 10 to 15 year period towards the end of this strategy so very useful graph in terms of a summary because it really does show what the impact is over a 30 year period or a 30-year view of of the issues that are facing council in terms of infrastructure and particularly in that area of of asset replacement in the year 10 two year 25 sort of period so that 's the infrastructure strategy and this I don 't have any more detail to go through today all that unless there are any particular questions or well yeah I just kind of wanted to kick that off because i think the infrastructure strategy is something that is I mean really the financial strategy and the infrastructures strategy are the two most important under planning documents so when we develop the consultation document we really are going to have to highlight some of these issues quite explicitly and I guess the one that I 've got questions around relate to flood protection and control works and so page 28 and also on page 37 this is the landscape version side and i 'm not sure if i 've got the right page page 37 the stormwater management plans also cover flood protection and provide sufficient detail to feed into the capital program the overall confidence and these financial estimates as low and that worries me a lot and then going back to page 28 the projects we taken under the land drainage recovery programs still being developed and prioritized there is a large amount of uncertainty about the six hundred and twenty seven million dollar budget for the program the actual cost may be as low as 400 million through optimizing the program which means only doing stuff that 's essential it 's not actually getting an optimal outcome I don 't know that I like the word optimizing in that context I 've got used to it with the skirt program and only undertaking those projects with the greatest benefit or as high as 1.2 billion if all recommended projects are carried out regardless of benefit so I think that you 've highlighted and this is the role of the document the biggest area of risk that the city faces that 's correct that the reason why the estimates are Louis terms of and range recovery plan to fully understand the impacts of the land settlement and what that has on on the the catchment areas and what the best solution is for for dealing with with that impact Plus as I mentioned before we have to start taking into cognizance now that the climate change impacts that that 's not just sea level rise that 's increased rainfall and so on what what that may have so at this stage as we work through the land drainage recovery plan right now with their confidence in terms the financial estimates are as good as they can be at this stage and there is a lot of work got into those but there is still quite a lot of refinement to occur in that area but essentially 627 million is what we 're putting on budget and it could be as high as 1.2 billion that 's the indication from the current set of estimates yes yeah Pauline just talking about infrastructure and renewals when we build new infrastructure now what is the life expectancy is it now higher than the watch terms of you PVC pipe and silent we be using our sewers and so on this a similar sort of life Spanish it 's looking at the 70 to 80 year lifespan for those sort of materials of it could be engineered to have a longer life but it wouldn 't be cost-effective okay if it was and just a question on the cycleways I 've on page 43 there within the roads and footpaths of course cycleways and other than that um with their NZTA subsidies in the government 's urban cycleways program when can we get an idea of how much we can reduce our costings for our cycle ways through those subsidies because they could be considerable silent era possibly up to 75 the scene I believe because we 're still building in the total cost of the cycleways at the moment what what page are you on falling or page 43 of the lens that yep 43 this is the original fusion I just wonder why we got the landscape one this morning to look it 's what competition is this the same as the one we got this morning thank you so on the original one page 43 its page 39 of the landscape they were still budgeting for season here 148 million acid it was more like 156 but we could have savings up to seventy-five percent of their so this is the expenditure pro so the the difference between 156 billion which which we have reports to counsel in Paris papers recently that that is the still the full cost estimated cost of the major cycleway network there 's eight million dollars this year so that 's the reason for the difference between the two numbers the number that 's in this document is in there 's the data expenditures here and that is the expenditure the funding issue is I guess a different issue and so that 's the total cost of those as we heard from nzta two weeks ago the the cycle the urban cycle waste fund the special fund is starting to come through and they are developing parameters for using that for improving contributions from that on our program and this one hundred million dollars available over the 've indicated what we may be able to expect locally from that fund similarly from nzta qualifying projects could get around about fifty percent funding assistance in they qualify to the nzta criteria but it will depend very much when we get down to the detail of each project how much funding assistance they get from those two sources in terms of the alignment to the urban cycleway fund objectives so there 's national objectives and how one each cycle way lines with those objectives that they 've outlined to us that they will have a moderation process to sit down and consider that and then decide what percentage of that particular project they will contribute to from that fund similarly with NZTA some elements of each cycle way will not qualify for funding from NZTA because they take the transport view so if there 's some of the recreation aspects or whatever it may not qualify funding under their rule so we may only get seventy percent of the project funded at fifty percent so it 's quite variable but I think in the funding side of the statements sort of overall levels of funding we might get in to support that major cycle waste program all rights at the moment that 's another unknown pretty much would we have a timeline when we might know that isn 't mean is it one year two years ten years where do we apply each year on a case-by-case basis by case-by-case basis we have to make an application for each peach section of each project well it 's not even an entire project at section by section but I think Pauline 's pointers is that the cost to the ratepayer won 't be the total amount that 's shown here it will be reduced by whatever we 're able to successfully claimed by way of contribution from either of both of those fun potentially quite significantly potentially quite significant or operations is certainly realistic to expect as a reasonable proportion of those goals to be funded from the two other funds yes I think that 's right too so thank you for raising that Pauline Paul just we won other concern which I don 't see reflective of a document and the potential flood verse in the future is potential other major seismic events happening over the next 30 years and I don 't know how we actually budget aside from the Headroom we may have been there but no major seismic event would actually have a massive impact on the council I suppose we address that or we do address that issue within document under in terms of our our resilience and how we approach resilience so identifying core assets that are essential for life line roots and and supporting groups of communities and building resilience as best we can into the services that provide those those lifeline roots and those services such as water and wastewater to those call communities as you say there there are a wide range of events that could happen and the only way that we can approach each one of those is to to agree between the asset groups what is a where we need to build resilience to still be able to maintain core services in any one of those events and so that 's what we have graded the assets in of our approach to and yours core assets ones that support lifeline roots and so on have been taken less of a risk approach towards when they need to be renewed and you could push that out but that obviously increases the level of risk in terms of resilience Phil Michaels is also relation to hazards a Mike music reference Christa the sea level rise and just really about the cost in the event of our aquifers being polluted either by way of saying salt water infiltration of the aquifers or in the event of say the Aqua fire in the airport the Northwest for that being polluted by way of oil or spell all that that kind of thing so it I 'm just wondering are you and it 's not a document unexpected but in terms of future costs if we 've got any estimated costs a of what what of a system where for example we had to treat water from the Waimakariri as an alternative source of water supply we haven 't tried to cost that in terms of the aquifers and management of the aquifers to better understand how they perform and the best protection for all those aquifers is is some demand management in terms of managing those aquifers so salt water doesn 't get effectively sucked into them by x drawing on the on the resource things can so in effect that sort of like a an unknown cost at the moment in thank you okay you outline in here their absolute importance of groundwater and just how we need to mitigate any risk whatsoever to that in Christchurch so this document then feed into every other part of the council this document is links into the different strategies so the particularly in terms of what we 're talking about here the water supply strategy or the water strategy so that will look in detail at what is councils strategy in terms of water supply and this document is really reflected the recommendations and actions that are are coming through a problem that stretch strategic document driven into the castle organization the idea that we wouldn 't take any risks with those anyways correct that would be dealt with under in terms of water supply and protecting that water supply good ender sorry last question on the climate change estimator of sea level rise given that we 've gone for one meter in the district plan I 'm assuming we would look to that same figure and here I would always see I 'm not part of that word but I will see we would take that that into account when we 're doing the malting for the land drainage recovery program yes Oh justjust only because it is my understanding of the actors were rather dry by the year 2000 41 if we continue air consumption it right we are at the moment so with that in mind if we 're looking at a 2045 there 'd have to be some assumption around our sexy purifying water source somewhere there are several ways of managing the aquifers and certainly some form of demand management is something that will guarantee that that supply or will protect that supply for Locker but I think the understanding exactly of the performance of those aquifers and their capability is the confidence of that is not not better as we look to the next 30 years add attempting what we can and can 't_''_1637.78 use from those I 'm hang on just a minute desert I think my Taylor would like to make a comment our water current will supply so it doesn 't anticipate any absorption of current our current water capacity in fact some of the more recent training data suggests that we may have greater capacity we 've had trip then we 've previously planned for I don 't think that it changes the fact that actually effective demand management or something we should be aiming for but there 's no absolute risk or loss of water for the council that we can anticipate yep yani oh sorry Paul you I interrupted you did they see your question i 'm just going to say at the end of it they 're cheap that she highlights the importance of that effort from management absolutely absolutely highlights 8.0 yep yani thanks um several questions but I 'm thank you for the work that you 've done on this I know it hasn 't been easy page you 've got it 191 so I think there needs to be some explanation is to wear those costumes have come from I 'm sorry what 's it what 's the landscape so what we 've got landscape and you 've got portrait yes oh no wait what assumptions and financial risks rolled in poop parts no literally to you but I can 't tell what it does on this _"

    "text": "and we now move to the 2015 25 long-term plan and if I could have Peter guts all and cross Gregory think and anyone else who 's sitting at the end of the table are you alone if the whole organization behind us excellent answer excellent answer okay so so what I 'm going to do is just by way of introduction just go through a resolution that I 'm proposing seconded by Councillor park and then I 'm going to hand over to you Peter I think you 're presenting the audit and risk management committee recommendations is that right I can do that man yes and and then you 're going to talk on the financial strategy and supporting documents and then Chris Gregory on the infrastructure strategy I know that the chief executive wants to mention a particular issue on the draft activity management plan and so in fact I might just get here to do that right at the outset because we don 't want to have some debate on what might be a front-page story on the paper this morning when it 's not not the resolution that we put into the meeting is adopting the information that will provide the basis for the council 's draft long term plan and which will be relied on for the content of the consultation document yet to be adopted by the council and will be adopting that on the 10th I fingers of March subject to the orders of general providing a reporter 's the quality of the information and then noting that the information comprises an addition to the financial strategy the infrastructure strategy the community outcomes and then activities and services which are the activity management plans and levels of service that we have debated last year and discussed and gone through with a fine-tooth comb and I 'm just going to hand over to Colleen on that basis thank you you would have all seen in the information the press this morning in relation to the libraries and recall that that 's not what council was wrong the information came from the draft libraries activity management plan which included start that have proposed reductions and levels of servers but again that you recall that service '_''_174.22 correct however the reference to proposed reductions were not removed from the activity management plan when the council decided not to proceed with them so that 's an administrative oversight and we 'll update the plan around that so we 've added under activities and services that subject to clarifications be provided and approved by myself on certain levels of students so thank you very much for that then the it also deals with the capital program the financial statements accounting policies significance and engagement policy revenue and finance and policy policy on remission durance scroll up because I don 't need to read what people can read for themselves but you 'll see the asterisks is to the side of those and these are subject to consultation being carried out concurrently with the consultation document so we 're out for consultation on the significance and engagement policy the policy on remission and postponement of rates the funding impact statement etc so we carry on down we are noting resolution 6.2 of the minutes of the council meeting of 5th December so that 's when we made our months the additional leavers identified in the staff report and that and that in the event these options are not found to be viable then the council will further divest from its asset base and as a result of the investigation confirms the release of 550 I mean as agreed back in December last year and then agrees the release of an additional 200 million capital making a total of seven fifty million to ensure the council 's sold for the worst-case scenario and then prior to the release of any capital council results to review and consider independent expert advice on the optimal capital release program we 've received advice obviously that different share packages with different amounts there 's a discount or premium whichever way you look at it for different packages and that 's something that we do need to take into account when we 're making the final decision and resolves that during the course of the consultation on the 10-year plan will review all aspects of the capital program and I think that information that came to light between the time that we settled on a slightly different view of the capital program may have been adopted so we 're committing to go back into the capital program and have a really good look at it again and we 're also requesting the chief executive to report on something that I know that there 's been a considerable frustration about and that 's the carry forwards so that 's putting things on budget for the capital program which aren 't capable of being delivered and our view as their budgeting really for what is deliverable should be our focus and so we 're asking the chief executive to report back on that as well as further optimization of operational expenditure prior to the conclusion of the consultation period so by the time we get to the final decision I 'm hoping that we 'll be in a position to know you know what to know that we 've applied do rigor really to both the capital program into the operational expenditure of the council we 've asked that we 're asking and this resolution not to accept the rates increases proposed and the and the them to 8.7 58.5 8.5 and then 7.5 further for the year that hasn 't really focused on on our at agenda before but that that gives the smoothing and under the double digits which is something we were keen to achieve as we go out for consultation and and then adopting the financial strategy we resolving around operating revenues and operating expenditures in terms of the prudence requirements and authorizing the chief financial officer and the chair of the audit risk management committee to make any amendments to the information for the purpose of ensuring its alignment with the Auditor General 's report and I know that you 'll speak to that Peter I think that you know just in terms of just the technicality of of making those amendments without having to to come back and then we 've also asked for a delay to the usual three yearly review of the capital endowment fund and request staff to provide advice on winding up the fund and the implications of so doing that 's not going to cause any particular impact on this but we do want to a some capital available to us but that seeking a report on that as that as the approach that we 're going to adopt so if I could hand over to you Peter to take us through the audit and risk management recommendation and then also the and then a discussion on the financial strategy and supporting documents thinking thinking that means if we start with your own risk management committee which met only a couple of days ago they were looking at what recommendation they would place in front of council today having had the chance to review the financial strategy and underlying documents and had a number of discussions over time so that the recommendation is on the board in front of you and I 'd also invite the deputy chair to anything that he wants to do as we go through as well so the committee has made the recommendation to Council that note they have reviewed the long-term draft financial strategy and the supporting document and you 've had the opportunity to discuss the plan with management the committee 's applied its terms of reference to audit New Zealand and received their update on the work to date and would note that an audit opinion and letter of representation are not yet available so they that 's something that would normally have and are recommending not at this point in time they also received a verbal report from Simpson grierson and while we expected to receive that draft written report prior to the council meeting and that is not yet previously as of eleven o 'clock when I walked out but there was the verbal update at the meeting note that in the committee 's opinion the draft financial strategy and supporting information are supported by appropriate management signups so that the process has been rigorous and further recommend to adopt the draft financial strategy and underlying information subject to the Auditor General 's report in the written legal advice the council mr. resolution and the second to last recommendation from them was that the council resolution must be specific with respect to the required release of 750 million dollars of capital from the CC TOS to support the financial strategy and the final point authorized and risk management committee to make any amendments to the information for the purpose of ensuring its alignment with the Auditor General 's report so and that is probably a good point at which to expand on what that recommendation which is echoed and the council recommendation and what that report is what that recommendation is intended to do is to allow myself in the chair of armc to make technical adjustments to the underlying information to make sure that it all lines up and if there 's a technical aspect that audit New Zealand comes back on around an accounting policy a treatment review that we can throw that on without having to come back for further advice so it 's not around substantive changes its technical based on ultra general advice an aspect where this might might work with what counsel is seeking is assuming the recommendation is different from the current staff recommendation then those will have to flow through all the underlying documentation and come back out and that would be allowing that to happen yeah which would you like to eat something at reef and yeah i think the order Desmarais management committee did a good job on this they had to review a huge amount of documentation especially for the independent members I think probably as far as councillors concerned the most important item here is number seven the auditors have stressed this that if we do not approve the release of 750 million dollars of capital from our CC TOS basically cannot pass the financial strategy and we will be out of business so I think councillors need to take that very carefully yeah that 's it yani I just want to be clear what we 've just been told is that will be out of business if we don 't sell off no no sorry excuse me I 'm not going to have a debate with what councillor mangie said as the Deputy Chair as their auditors were clear that the council resolution must be specific with respect to the required release of 750 million dollars so you can 't_''_727.03 say up to 750 million dollars they were very crystal clear it had to be 750 million dollars in order to get or we 're out of business in a loose phrase that certainly wasn 't a technical term that was used by the office of the auditor general if we don 't pass a budget then technically I agree we are required to pass a budget but at this moment having I don 't want to have a discussion about us now because it 's relevant to the due to the issue that we 're going to be talking with received a report all we 're dealing with at the moment is the recommendation from audit and risk management committee read the financial strategy they are simply saying that the council resolution must be specific with respect to the required release of 750 million dollars this was in response to a question that was very carefully put to them which is can we use the phrase up to 750 million dollars and the very clear answer was no we cannot say up to 750 million dollars we have to solve for 750 million dollars my question was in regard to the required release of 750 million dollars understanding that that 's key question I had though is if that capital is found from savings to the capital program what is the material difference well that 's not what the rip this is a very soon a recommendation yes sir there 's nothing to debate about it no no it 's not I don 't want to have that question that will you could ask that question when we get to the financial strategy because obviously there are a number of questions that people have around the financial strategy and how you solve for an amount but the 750 million dollars the whole purpose of making this resolution specific and and I have to say that I was the one that wanted to have this specifically written into the recommendation from the audit and risk because it was raised at audit and risk was to explain why we couldn 't use the phrase up to and I know that some councillors did want us to use the phrase up to and I wanted to make it explicit that this was a recommendation from audit and risk confirmed by the Audit Office that 750 million dollars we actually have to be explicit that we will release 750 million dollars should be required to do so Peter would you like to carry on with your absolutely so now I 'll turn to the agenda and in particular the long-term plans I 'll be referring to the council agenda and the report that 's attached I 'm intending to take less than a minute for each month that we 've actually spent on doing this long-term plan up to this point so it won 't CLE a long page turn and but I will try and hit the highlights while Chris and I are sitting out here in front of you it was not facetious when I said the organization is behind us every part every team of the organization has been involved in this over a long long period of time and councillors themselves know how detailed some of those reviews were having gone through the activity management plans for instance so this is that this is asked representing the organization with respect to the the process and document links I 'd have to doesn 't quite go far enough it does go to the point of exhaustive in terms of a process the activities the asset management plans the policies and of course within those aspects also having regard to the strategic aspects that have to be taken into account as well this is not just a BAU plan as everyone knows the information and assumptions that we 're looking for today to be approved as per the mayor 's recommendations and also set out in paragraph three point four of the the report the council has in front of them and again I won 't read them out but one of the key ones which chris will talk to shortly is infrastructure strategy but there are a number of other of keys as well the funding policy revenue and financing etc the framework under which we 're operating is the local government act 2002 so that imposes some restrictions upon us and it also some definitions that we have to follow as well we are highly unusual as I 've mentioned we have a number of uncertainties in the plan it 's this probably pushes envelope even of that we have for the first time 30-year infrastructure strategy that 's first cross councils across New Zealand but no other Council of New Zealanders facing the same level of uncertainties we have and a number of that uncertainties are around funding and funding sources if I turn to the purpose of the financial strategy is the main document on discussing it 's to facilitate prudent financial management it provides that guide against which the council can consider proposals for either funding or expenditure and it also provides a context for consultation on those proposals because it 's transparent about services rates debt and investments so all of those aspects that that come into it so the task today is to seek adoption of the financial strategy and underlying documents subject to the office of the auditor general so that they can be integrated into the consultation document which can then be published and that conversation can be held with the public overall in my opinion the financial strategy is prudent and of in my opinion are a high quality as well okay we taking it as read I don 't need to do page tune but the overview itself I think captures the essence of what the financial strategy is doing the challenge for the city is to face not just twenty fifteen to twenty twenty-five but also beyond its funding the rebuild and restoration of the city it 's returning levels of service to at least pre-earthquake condition for roading water wastewater land drainage and community expectations we also have to fund the replacement of underground pipes that are installed in the 50s and 60s that 's coming up within the 30 years and that expenditure challenge is made even worse by uncertainties around quantum and timing of funding in instance when you boil it down the financial strategy has three or four levers that you can pull and it 's a balance between those which determine what the financial strategy looks like so there 's the expenditure required to deliver the levels of Sir which sets what we 're funding and then we can pull the funding levers of rates debt and sale of part of C CHL 's investment portfolio of expenditure is set but the four factors are interrelated and movement of one needs to be balanced by movement and at least one of the other variables and to further illustrate if rates increases we reduce then some combination is required of reduced expenditure more dead end or more capital release and I know everyone round the around the council table as well aware of this dynamic we 've we 've ever for a while so the proposed financial strategy presents a solution to these challenges and some alternatives as well and looks at a balanced approach and measure across the use of those levers the recommended strategy there isn 't contained within the documents and the underlying information at this point is to realize that net value of up to 750 million last is a up to dear that was prior to that audit office together with rate increases to current rate payers over the next three years of ten eight and eight this proposal would result in net debt to revenue peaking at two thirty eight percent in 2020 and declining to under 150 by 2045 because that 's important and the desired hundred and fifty million dollars of headroom that gap between our debt and their borrowing limit would be achieved in every year except for a couple which is 20 20 and 21 and that would be the value of the groom you have in that time so that 's the the most exhaustive part of the document that I will turn to but if we think about what the key factors are that underlying the financial strategy I 've got four that I think really needs some focus rating based growth is is a key aspect as our changes in population and rating units levels of service which then determine the expenditure we 're funding is the third and the the fourth would be cascio agreement ownership and within that I 've noted that there are some assumptions where the ownership is still ambiguous not yet agreement around the one that stands out on that list is the first one which is the bus exchange you know that could be ours or private so the state would made an assumption around it for planning of warhead capital expenditure as the other key factor as well and I 'll draw your attention to the graph on page six please not because I want to dig into it but because I think it will be an important reference point when Chris talks to the infrastructure strategy particularly when we look at the peak of expenditure all that the wave of expenditure past the end of the long term plan turning now to how have we informed the financial strategy there have been four main strategic factors that we 've used to inform what potential solutions could be and they are keeping debt under control being fair with the burnham of costs across generations so it 's intergenerational equity is the catch cry for that but it really is just being fair across generations _"

agenda this came their strategy and Finance the other day so I 'm I 'm yeah I 'm just wondering whether would anyone Mike would you like to go through the document at all and and just highlight some key features or would you just like to have questions I think we could probably between Gavin and myself so I don 't know some councils like no Gavin Thomas who 's joined us as a senior policy analyst in the policy team who 's picked up some of this work essentially just to provide very a high-level oversight one of the things that council asked us to go away and do was to look at how we could apply catchment models or to break down some of the catchments that make up the development contributions with a view to ensuring that the charges fairly fell where the capital works were being considered we looked at a had a variety of effects on on prices we the three options we considered was basically looking large were the one that caused the most concern both from an understanding perspective but also from a cost perspective where the how we dealt with water supply and wastewater collection so we looked at trying to establish catchments for that what that generated for us aah they were difficult to break down in captions because they tend to operate as a single Network in both instances but equally if you try to break them down into catchments some of those boundaries were quite artificial and actually you 've got greater and consist season swings with in catchments and you 've got applying them as a district-wide charge so we basically look at the at a number of options around that and our recommendations basically in terms of catchments was to continue to adopt district-wide catchments for water supply and wastewater we 've signaled that there may be future work in future DC reviews we would have supply may be able to be considered as a catchment but we don 't have the other matter that we were asked to look at and there are around rebate policies for specific areas and what we 're asking Council to confirm is that like the residential rebate any future rebates it in addition to the policy rather than as part of the policy per se and that is both that keeps the policy clean indirect but also makes it quite transparent with council is choosing or linking to rebate that it does so in a very transparent and accountable manner and you mean by that that 's the money sits on our fund and it has drawn down on when people successfully apply for the rebate yes so so effectively what you are saying is mate allowing the policy to strike the dcs where the costs fall saying quite explicitly beyond that we are choosing to rebate a certain costs through a certain area for a particular purpose and as you 've rightly outline then establishing a fund to credit the dcs for that as that 's drawn down and the viewers is that that 's a cleaner methodology been allowing for it and the will will hide the fact that in fact that 's its rates money that 's going into well with rates makes its council income that 's actually going into the into the payment on that 's correct exactly yes okay there was obviously a lot of discussion the at the committee around the catchments because I think there 's a natural desire to move to catchments but I guess what persuaded me was the was the map that showed that even if you use the catchment system you actually end up with perverse outcomes because you end up charging in areas where you wouldn 't want to charge because the infrastructures already there simply because of the way the catchments operators it and am I remembering that correctly yes that 's correct yep Yanni um thank you I I see you 've made changes to the names as as discussed at the committee 's so that 's good if you 're going to page 49 and look at the new retaining wall at 270 winery main road solicited estes trip wyd but then if you go to the northern arterial trying to understand why a retaining wall at winery which I thought would be pretty localized would be classified as district-wide and yet a major highway that services the entire city is classified one particular area so i guess is really a question that i have around how you 've actually chosen what the basis is for these things being either district-wide or or there is okay at this stage the asset managers themselves have prepared the list of capital projects and apportioned the percentages growth to the various attachments and we have found one or two what we think our anomalies and during the consultation period will certainly be going through the list just make sure that everything is being allocated as everybody agrees it should be say and I can 't speak about that one particular instance and there may be good reasons why a retaining wall and wrap a key is allocated as district-wide I simply don 't know but we are going to go through all the stuff capital projects and make sure they are as they should be yeah I think it 's really important mean we can 't obviously having a specific debate today about changing each of these they 're probably not something we can do now not at this point I mean as I say we will go through them during the consultation period and I 'm not anticipating there would be large-scale changes so any changes that there are won 't slaves free to any significant difference in the amount of development contribution charged for any particular area so sorry have you stopped on with the next paper Oh hip-hop this have been to the knee I 'm not I 'm not I wasn 't paying attention and stories I should have been i was looking for the number and I I only just realized then that you had slept on to the next row sorry it 's really do but that 's the issue around catchments if I know um and so we 've got a district-wide right zone anything we 've got the catchments and I 'm just having I 'm really struggling to align how with how we 've got divided those up but i think that i gone through and given you some advice on each of these about why they fit into each catchment or district-wide i 've made that allocation based on where they see the benefit falling and so if it 's a community-wide benefit and not something they can allocate to the particular catchment that cost has been allocated it does district widely also be so that 's that 's cold but the other thing that we will discuss that strategy of Finance which I think would be really helpful and I won 't talk I just think this helps look at this together is yeah actually have the project number next to each of these projects so that if I wanted to look in and see actually what is right our own stage to be a knight and make a submission I can say actually I don 't think this should be in this catchment all this should be destroyed why you actually believe is it you made that point at the at the committee and I think there 's a peer point and obviously with the electronic means that we have hard ask and it you 've been simply looking at how we can do that in a practical in an effective kind of way so yeah I think it 's just a hyperlink on each one yeah no I agree I mean just the final person for me just around that rebate stuff I just want to be really clear what are we proposing a central city rebate we 've been asked to go away and do some work on that so that 's a piece of ongoing we 're not we haven 't proposed that at this point no so there 's nothing in the long-term plan that puts money aside for not a stately district it screams to seek revenge okay thanks all we have is the residual of the residential central city residential one so are there any other questions is there any debate 00 be good to have a mover and seconder Jamie moves and seconded by paul i 'll put the motion all

right so on that legend you 'll see there a number of things that relate to the central city for example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 zones that are called central city something a rather in the first left hand column and in fact those zones relate to map 32 and 39 and those are the Mets that cover the central city area all of those zones need to be deleted from the legend and obviously actually I need to put these up in a resolution as well that all central city zones be deleted from the legend similarly in the middle column there are again about halfway down suits under other notations central city active frontage central city active frontage of Miranda there are 4 items there under other notations that need to be deleted from the legend I can have you got distributor as well come out as well so let 's just say that all central city zones other notations and overlays be deleted from the legend and so similarly in the right hand column there is also here to Jaden 's only central city and significant trees only central city that should be deleted so and just to remind you then what will come into this legend and due course when we bring you back those three chapters that are being delayed eid is the stage two natural hazard overlays the natural and cultural heritage symbols and the central city stuff this will come back then so if you go to map 32 and 39 just put a big cross through all that area that covers the central city that should all be gray because those zones aren 't being dealt with with what 's going to be notified on the second of May should just be gray because because in the very first resolution of the day I asked you to consider delaying the Central City chapter because it 's not yet in a fit state to bring to to talk out because it shouldn 't be located in here we were going to bring to you the Central City chapter today I get that I 'm just wondering and correct me if I 'm right you allow me doing so why don 't you just say we 're taking everything to do with a central city out of here well it 's a resolution that 's why I 'm just showing you what is actually going to come out because this is what is currently on the public agenda at the moment this is what the public can see so we need to have a resolution to change that so that what goes to the ministers is in fact correct what we 've dealt with today that 's great it 's not it 's not a shortcut it 's this is because the central city chapter and it 's related Mets have not come to you today no we just say yeah we agree with it it 's right and I 'm just showing you with what that means on their tipis that 's all I 'm showing okay yeah so I need a knee the more krishi there are you leave some over overall resolutions yeah so it 's simply consequential amendments to be made post the proofreading exercise which is where these chapters go next before they go to the ministers thank you yes so regarding to this the training makes the issue so original yeah we playing are you happy to move yeah okay yes holy in the second all those in favor say aye against Kerry anymore yes these final resolutions Lisa final yeah yeah I mean ok holy move re second all those in favor say aye against ok yeah that 's that 's actually really confusing you that 's really good if it can read the resolutions because there 's so many different resolutions going on but I just wanted to check one phone with staff have our Sarah or the government you know we had a working party set up with them previously for stage 1 have they been involved in terms of stage 2 absolutely they 'd been involved in the collaborative advisory group the whole way through all the to consult with statutory bodies which include sarah our neighboring district councils the regional council like laughing so have we got like last time we got the kind of overview of what their feelings we 're towards stage one have we got it for stage 2 um oh I don 't have that here with me at the moment I 'm sorry no I don 't have that here but there is something that there will be things that they will disagree with for example where there are not where there is not compliance with the RPS for example the querying rule the potential for you and the soccer development you 're saying you thought of that could be circulated to us so we could we could see what this Pacific concerns where but yeah do you want to do that before you sign anything off today um no that 's fine because we would chance to look at it went spector the minister 's comments but just those other resolutions that quickly got past I know that listen that was just put up on the screen and voted on so that 's just the planning that yes so then the fight like the final mission from me array is that is there an oval resolution to send this whole document to approve this document entity to the minister every chapter has head at the top of it if you flick back right so that 's already been done scroll down yes the every chapter has at the top of that that okay and they 're also glows for the Mets there 's Lionel resolutions are simply because the next step before these go to the ministers is proof reading so all this is about these final ones is to allow those proofreading grammatical spelling errors to be changed and if there are consequential amendments regarding numbering because of some of that proofreading that 's all letters yeah it 's are you happy okay so this one with ya so the hole in the move and a lead a second all those in favor say aye against Harry yes having any any the more items no no before that way before the closure of the meeting I 've like tompa for older stuff whether a for an equator performance for preparing all those comprehensive document you down the creditor thank you hey so I a lance

    "text": "so our last chapter for today 's coastal environment and fiona unison okay yes feel that how does terrify the approaches to get goofy got some px license today children to previous minutes do they need to be dealt with today just what we know now they can be done next queen estoy bien ok ok thank you peace ok good afternoon the coastal environment chapter it 's a relatively slim chapter that identifies the coastal environment as more or less directed under the New Zealand coastal policy statement and also in recognition of the direction given in the canopy regional policy statement so we 've met a coastal environment overlay and we 've got objectives and policies that give direction to the interpretation of that coastal environment area for the most part this chapter relies on rules and other zones that are joined the coastal marine area boundary that 's the mean high-water springs for Resource Management Act purposes and also relies importantly on district-wide rules in the natural and cultural heritage chapter particularly the subdivision chapter and also the general rules chapter there is one discrete coastal zone margin zone in the christchurch city plan has been extended slightly to incorporate a couple of other areas where there 's a yacht club and and also a little bit of costal margin with us a little bit of grassed area but for the most part the zone covers sandy and rocky beach areas of the christchurch city where historically there 's been Philly intensive imparts recreational use of these areas so we 've rolled those a lot of those provisions over there we 've extended them a little but to recognize that there 's things like park benches and picnic tables things like that that we 've included in the definition of passive recreation activities there 's a provision for management of planting areas and habitat restoration because a lot of that area is actually covered in exotic exotic vegetation so we 're making provision for the introduction of indigenous species where that that 's appropriate we 've also been working on coastal hazards but as I 've signaled an earlier presentations we 're proposing that they go in the natural hazards chapter as part of the stage 2 being developed and will be finalized within the next month and you 'll see that when we present their stage 2 natural hazards chapter we 're also making provision in another chapter for coastal hazard mitigation works there 's no actual provision for coastal revetments and coastal protection works which support a lot of that the roading and other structures around the district 's host lines that we 're proposing those be included in the general rules chapter coming to the resolutions effectively that little tidy up such and editing issues that we didn 't quite get through and one of them was she 's just been resolved and in the last week has been a a new map of scheduled batches and to be acknowledged and those to be removed so there 's been a working party of counselors that 's been working with my colleague Sarah Oliver who 's been working on that particular part of this chapter as part of her work on the residential bad chip batches zone so some of you will be familiar with that so that map that proposing to include an updated schedule batches and those to be removed will still sit in the residue sure chapter section 32 the second resolution is about the proposed in line map showing the coastal environment overlay we 'd want to make was actually more schematic the reason for including this map is so that people can look at that just as they do with the the mapping and the natural hazards chapter for example we 've identified where the liquefaction assessment one and two areas people can have a quick look here and get a general indication of where the coastal environment overlay is located we don 't need the inset maps we don 't need identification of a zonings we just need a general outline with the coastal environment line demarcated the next resolution resolution three is just to update some of the zoning errors that we found there 's a little bit was a couple of areas that where the coastal zone errs extended a bit and now it 's it 's actually been replaced by transport zone a little bit of an kind of an area just to the east of land near whitewash here that are actually included and the transport zone rather than the conservation phone the last resolution is probably the most significant because we 've made an error here and instead of zoning blend coastal we 've included it in the transport zone and that 's come about because a lot of the margins around the coastline are actually unformed legal road and this is another editing issue so the area that of hatch that kind of looks like a rabbit 's league and the knee cap they should be included in the coastal zone the other key aspect is that the coastal zone rather than them being the red polka dots is shown on me and part of the caption at resolution for should all be blue as it was in the original briefing we 've done a wee bit of a switching back and forth wondering whether the coastal chapter should be notified at the same time as the natural and cultural heritage chapter so that 's why that little editing issue has come about but we 'd prefer that it went now was reasoned sea and effectively then again would represent the same areas that you 're seeing in that resolution 3 which is pretty much the the coastline along the christchurch city urban area thank you is my angel you referring to the schedule batches and batches to be removed there 's no mention in this section of the batches at Mary gardens no should there be or interruptions we didn 't know that they were there I was just taking the attitude that we don 't mention them because we didn 't know that was actively they haven 't been through any of this process previously as you 're aware and I became aware because of my involvement with the natural hazards chapter that they only be the council become aware of them post the earthquakes again there illegally established they 're all sitting right at the base of the cliff right at the top of the tide line we think it 's probably pertinent not to acknowledge them effectively that 's okay great ya know as long as it 's not an oversight that 's fine no and then I have placed or not because it 's not a planning question but it certainly is a consideration this information in as much as we 're in open meeting and this agenda is an open agenda is in the public arena this is potentially the first time that the owners of those batches at Taylor 's mistake Boulder Bay and so on will have the opportunity to know the outcome of the working parties discussions is there going to be any engagement with the people that are affected by this I mean I know we 've been told that we shouldn 't be having any direct involvement with either side of the debate on the batches but in as much as there 's now information which is in the public arena which will be of grave concern to the people that are affected by this and there have been public meetings facilitated by Peter Mitchell these bachelors have been invited to I think it would be reasonable if we were to engage with them in some way and give them a heads up that this is where not even so much that this where this has gone and cancel attorney is just to answer that question as you 'll all be aware we 're starting an awareness campaign post the second of March when all of these chapters have gone to the ministers to inform people of what is actually in the draft chapters and and the implications of that and the reason for having that post the chapters have gone to the ministers is so that it can 't_''_560.68 be construed as public consultation because we all know that this has been contracted the time frame for these stage two chapters but use the intention is to through the media and through specific meetings with groups we will be having those awareness that awareness continued and I mean that really sums up my point I 'm assuming that this is a group where they 'll be a specific engagement because I wouldn 't want them to find out what was happening just through to me no it wouldn 't be specific engagement no it would not be classed as consultation the the whole purpose of this is to encourage people to so the way to interact with this plan is through submissions okay whew yeah I guess just following on from that I maybe because of the content to help the continuous nature of this part though at least a species turns playing around with their part and I know there is the awareness campaign has the opportunity is the opportunity for the council to go to in the form of officers to go to various parties and to have through the media and a complete program to make people aware of waters and the draft chapters and to encourage them to submit if they have any concerns yeah we want to see what other campuses and people think too for that we cannot have a different process for one group of people this is another group of people that 's the quickest way to a judiciary review of whole process I think you and I just want to ask you about the unformed legal roads paper right looks like a day and it 's enough sort of provision to within the within this chapter to prevent four-wheel drive say riding thing counselors dealt with through about various bylaws there 's two bylaws I can 't_''_693.32 quote them but we did check that out because that issue was raised through some of the consultation that we had with some of the community board members and particularly on the banks peninsula area so there are two bylaws and some of air one of our in-house policy and analysts have aware of of that sort of their show so it thank you my other question area is around Meriel marine reserves which we have one and the peninsula so where does that fit into this chapter well I 've got no specific knowledge of that but effectively that will be in that area that 's beyond the council 's jurisdiction i would think which is sort of seaward of the mean high-water springs or the coastal marine area boundary so that would be Eakins and responsibilities anything below mean high-water mark so mean high-water mark on the beach towards the ocean as the responsibility of here can up to i think it 's 12 kilometers out to see that till the bars aren expect that the Department of Conservation has some responsibility in that area as well there because of you buggy objectives you can pertain to the around the ecosystem being more than just the you know that limit but think of it are there any more questions no the Enzo are you happy to move the stab the proposed recommendation okay poor late to pick second okay in to move and the poor shake and all those in favor say aye against Harry next item thank you _"

    "text": "thank you paden to my right chapter leader for the open space checker and even write open space chapter and is concerned primarily with provision of open spaces for recreation and amenity as well as conservation of natural areas of open space including high biodiversity areas landscape outstanding landscapes as well as water and imagines of various water bodies so that 's what the open space chapter covers we have were proposing to reduce the number of zones from the current 23 across to district plans to five which focus on the type of open space and its function so open space community park zone deals with the old neighborhood parks varying in range from urban city pocket parks two large air packs providing and room for informal playgrounds or office sports fields through to metropolitan facilities which focus on a large scale build facilities such as pioneer stadium poor complex as an example then we have McLain 's island zone which is a pretty discreet unique zone because of the it 's location is located in a flood prone area and its uses are limited by that very reason facilities clubs such as shooting clubs or make art and vintage car clubs or Anna Wildlife Park so those activities that benefit from large areas and also the isolation relative isolation meaning not annoying any residential neighbors duo can locate in that area a open space natural zone that covers the natural areas of various amenity or landscape or ecological or biodiversity values the concentration of them for christchurch will be on the port hills on the banks peninsula also generally high areas on the hills as well as some areas adjacent to the coast there are some flat open space natural areas within christchurch such as for example Travis wetland and lastly open space water in margins own zone which covers the rivers upstream and downstream rivers and lakes at the moment these cover rivers in christchurch area banks peninsula requires a little bit more work to identify those that 's nearly done and we may be able to map them through submission and introduce them into the pen through a submission process currently they still require a little bit more work so that 's the open space zones the version that you have seen or some minor changes have been introduced to the plan one of them will be m which is probably most visible it would be targeting matters of discretion for various recreational activities more individually so they are easier to preps to see and to relate to a particular activity and as a consequence it will be easier to administer another change is the metropolitan facilities zones used to have a limit of floor area which turns out to be quite unrealistic that on the other hand did not correspond with the overall building built side coverage so while the building site coverage limit was quite generous and and allowed for the development that is actually appearing on the ground the end building limit was unrealistic and there were many resource concerns to breach that raw I decided that the building site coverage is sufficient to control the scale of development and maintain amenity of the site overall without specifying this size of the buildings often they will be well over a thousand square meters in size and more now we also sorry just to have identified some mapping errors and I think a couple of them are showing up on the screen so they are to do with the sites at 60 here in gold coast road that 's an interesting one we have in further of a rezoning zoned consulate of general of people 's republic of china an open space it should be residential so we would like to amend that there this site at 232 roybal avenue is currently zoned in phase one as general industrial somehow it wasn 't picked up that that site is a council-owned reserve and we would like to design it to open space as well on the other hand phase two maps have extended the open space owning to the site of 23 to avoid bell avenue which is actually a privately owned industrial site so there is a little bit of problem I just asked you which zone which open space own you want Reuter lash a yes didn 't_''_377.69 I say that it should be ok the opens the 232 road where they have should go back to its phase the one a been resigned to open space Govinda pack no just say it 's general and yeah that 's right okay now it also since that was written up we 've discovered a couple more amendments needed to the maps and I would like to raise those who asked you for resolution to amend those sites as well if I can please the random apps under the same amendment years l 'occasion have amendments yes just different map it relates to me 33 two sides and one of them is the address official addresses 875 Haven side drive that 's the area which is a narrow longsight a surrounding Porat park it 's between the Oxbow of the avon river that surrounds the park and the park itself for some reason it got Ruiz owned to flip rent lend recovery a red zone effectively so we would like to take that off and put it back into the Metropolitan facilities owned the other one it 's a minor little we amendment oh there is a council-owned lend reserve account canceled on reserve at 176 Shortland Street and bexley and again we missed open space so that would be in that amendment required so what should that go to that should go to open space community park thank you see in the morning you have had a request for resolution to a met to make some amendments to the insert that comes from the natural and cultural heritage chapter going into the rural chapter and open space chapter you have approved the amendments to the rule chapter what we asking is that identical amendments are made to the open space chapter okay the wording here is perhaps not as precise as it should have been okay so the questions regarding the chapter 18 open space any questions Yanni so how many questions to your head oh yeah yeah so I know that there 's a number of private developments on there then filled Rugby Park yes so um so we 've got a private development having out in your test which i think is great and we want to support so I just want to put that into the open space and Recreation design so how can i do that could be difficult have considered that but this site is outside of the urban a razor burn limit which means the RPS pro basically does not allow us to apply urban zoning to that site as it is outside of the urban limit so it would first require a change to the app yes and and the urban element that has been introduced earlier yes yes it is considered to be urban activity rather than rural so it will go for a consent under the rural zoning in fact if they if they 're going to do that now will go under its existing operative plans owning which I suppose is still relevant all yes that 's have we not and everything else that we 've done have we not changed any ladies that 's outside of the urban living through the whole stage so much the limit our blend use its it 's the matter of zoning we basically cannot zone the land that is outside of the urban limit into a zoning which is typical of urban environment and open space is one of them the activities that are perhaps not that 's what is going to happen on that particular site but in answer to your question the only in fact we have one of them is that air around cranford Basin that we 're asking to move from rural which it currently to even even residential but we are meeting with it can and Sarah about that and initial discussions indicate that they would be amenable to that but there has to be a process in place to do that before the hearing obvious well can we do that for this because I just think like you know if someone wants to invest a lot of money that 's a sporting metropolitan facility that you know seems to make sense you know I just I think we should progress that along those same lines so again like with the Hanford it would require that would require a resolution and I guess the difference here is that there 's no particular benefit to the landowner in this particular case it 's not going to make it harder necessarily for them together consent to do the activity whereas in the cranford density residential in a rural area whereas big open spaces like this this facility we 're talking about them I think it 's a football academy and parkland you know feels associated with that is not so difficult to get under the rural activities own it 's just whether or not you feel it 's yeah it actually requires all that effort to make that change yes we can pursue it but would make any difference well it 's not that it won 't make any difference it 's just a lot of work to change the loop in the RP yes and he 's not necessarily any particular benefit to the landowner to do that activity it 's just my settin thats just my professional sense of it it 's quite it 's a different situation to cranford basin but i mean we I can still raise it if you wish me to when we go and talk about cranford basin but it 's not going to stop them from doing what they want to do anyway but it 's just adding more hurdles which I know it 's any hurdles I don 't think well then might require another was all consent for further development well they might it depends on how much development they 're actually going to be as part of it you know how many buildings and that kind of thing and what the scale is just to put into context like we 've just approached a special purpose golf zone which is probably beyond right beyond the even limit is it all it 's with a move in the month it 's got huge intensification of housing is within the urban limit it 's gonna make it easy for them to do it so now the special purpose zone is within the urban letters all right yep so I mean I just think we should be trying to do something through that so if the other process can make it easier then it 's set up the process for that to happen and could I just suggest then that as a part of the conversations with he can and Sierra about cranford basin I can include a conversation about this too and then if do that through a submission because it 's likely what 's going to have to happen for for Cranford base in anyway right do you want to specifically shin I don 't think this way of doing it I don 't think we had a specific resolution for Cranford basin did we know because that 's just something that we 're going to have to try and put in place otherwise we 're going to be inconsistent I 'm just thinking we didn 't do a special resolution on on my talking with those agencies about a process for Cranford base and so I don 't think we need that here too that 's what I was I know it was but I that will undertake to discuss this at the same nations are there any more crises no okay yes is hagley park as any I mean is that central city so we 're not doing yeah it is central city 's right um and setbacks from from rubbers or immunity for those waterways it 's into open space are we reducing any requirements or let me know they in the general rules in terms of setbacks from waterways for the purposes of building or filling in excavation the open space water and margins rolls deal with the activities and of course sunbelt form standards but generally speaking what that zone does not anticipate any permitted buildings any buildings would be discretionary so that we can assess the appropriateness of any such development and then just the final question is around the A&P grounds the agricultural park have we reflected and here the the nap we know why changes and also or hearings and also the possible use of the land on the other side of the road well yes that whole area is resigned to metropolitan facilities to allow for the the new sports hub that is being planned on the land yes and that there are specific provisions for agribusiness as well within that zone let 's go thank you okay we could just point you to the mat for that you 're talking but you 're twisting up in a way not only one up on the way that 's like a 37 or 44 don here we go so you the land we are referring to is on maps the 37 38 44 and 46 straddle for maps but on 37 you can just see in the bottom right corner designing applied to that area and now sooner why yep so you mean a pages 30 say work for me yes in the right bottom corner you can just see the northwest corner of that buddha by parks and that includes the zoning applied to the area north of the motorway and northwest of the motorway lifted the motorway there 's no special provisions in there run agribusiness or there is Agri business is there also a good business are contained in the appendix that similarly in a similar way to what the current plan is doing it defines areas within which they can carry out certain activities and can build facilities so there 's nothing new really in terms of their use of the park and we have to remember that that use is restricted to one week per year in terms of the show they have some lease agreements to use the land on map no 38 I think you will see them clearly yes then the area that is pretty much in the corner surrounded by the southern motorway and curl its road that 's the area where most of the agribusiness activities are taking place some of them a permanent because they do own some land there but in terms of temporary activities that 's covered through add line development plan and specific areas are identified for specific excuse me activities all right I am I guess they 'll make this omission but I 'm still not clear that the activity that they currently do if they were to lease the land north of the motorway they would be able to do for the use and yes I looked at that it 's and they I think my they 're planning on having some grazing lender which will be totally fine within that zone it 's it 's not going to be a problem for them are you happy ok galley yeah I mean ok I think I just have to my submissions and the Harrison you okay but you 'll okay all those in favor say aye ok Harry _"

    "text": "yeah so we 're a hit or a hit of ourselves well done guys we decided we 'd be to give Jimmy something that didn 't serve tonight so I could take the opportunity to deal with councillor Jones 's question about severe mercy and Tim 's street if you look at met 25 you should all have a netbook in front of you you 'll see that CA 18 actually covers two of those streets and lettuce well you should have been delivered this macbook to you as well and all of the all of the papers that were sent to you but I have an extra key you yeah so that 's the character area as it stands at the moment right okay thank you cigarette break and she 's coming down so um thank you you want to do your one yeah unfortunately we 've lost a meter so the society alarms gone out to find Anita and if you don 't mind then we 'll move on to chapter 21 specific purpose zones and perhaps we could invite and wicked of his first love set here purpose word groomers the one that I 'm talking to you about and we 're grandma dates on the drive chapter 21 21.1 and there aren 't any changes since you saw it last and I see me don 't need a an introduction to what were amazed and does and tag we will skip straight to questions if you 'd like no specific purpose we 've moved under chapter 21 specific purposes and special-purpose zone Wigram so it 's about halfway down the list all right so no changes from we saw it last are there any questions on the no changes okay so it provides for some aircraft movements it doesn 't include the previously a field or strip but there is still a big grassy area we can use helicopters etc and it also provides for the museum and bits and pieces around that it doesn 't you know I guess copy what was provided for in the resource consent for the convention center but they can continue because it has consent in existing use rights you have you looking I 'm Tim so with regards to got it so the word run museum has also a punch on the center yeah so that 's covered us as well so noise levels and what 's it it 's a bit of a gray air between what 's museum and associated with museum and what 's the convention center but between the resource consent and these rules they 're both provided for okay there haven 't been any issues that I 'm aware of no nothing I okay thank you thanks ref I 'm just a quick one on the port oh no we 're just doing Wigram first we 're sorry we had different chapter leaders for different chapters any morning Wigram okay some move on to the Gulf resolve with Glinda sorry looking at specific purpose own Golf Resort I don 't have anything to add to earlier presentations about this do you have any questions any questions on the Gulf are you talking about the Christchurch call for social and spins ago and no they haven 't there 's nothing on the ground at all I suspect oh um developers lost his financial baking so the purpose of doing not do we have like a time frame so we went it was quite a controversial resigning mmm and it got razon um you know it 's going to be great for the study and rah rah rah but if nothing 's happening there you kind of wonder with it it 's better to rezone it something else and I really yeah there was an option to raise our little lips pectorals owning and really the only reason that we 've retained it at the stages because that zone didn 't become operative until 2011 so it 's sort of a little bit more recent than some such zones but I guess through the down the track we could delete it he Sarah 's yeah there are um well there was the development proposed under the the zone which was actually a bit like sort of clear water mark two it 's sort of similar similar concept but more residential units and more Apartments you know not a slightly smaller site coast it 's our natural hazards but as that land actually suitable um I intensive it and especially post tooth quake I think that it probably significant geo technical issues there that went necessarily fully worked through during the process of that plan change but the natural hazards chapter will deal with that hmm it 's not dealt with as part of the specific purposes only yeah the natural hazard chapter and we 'll deal with overlays over stones that that are appropriate you 're going to fig it certificate of existing use they wouldn 't be able to get that because there 's nothing dear but in terms of their proposals that would need furious consent management plans to be put through council so it can 't actually happen is of right you 're confident we have enough robustness and there I think that we we will have because as a result of particularly aired recent natural hazards chapter amendments we 've got several geotechnical assessments that just depends on where you at in the process there 'll be geotech assessments prior to the kind of you know going ahead they will definitely be a geodetic assessment for any lenders consents needed end for did you have a question on us and it 's about the you know the toxicity that they there were chemicals they use on on golf courses and because that 's so low lying so close to the sticks on Brooklyn 's Lagoon would that be dealt with in the management plan or what area would that be dealt with them sorry I didn 't catch the actual term did you say toxicity here the toxins that are produced from the chemicals they use on golf courses oh do you mean and the threat to the waterways we decide some sort of funds use it no that 's probably so good yeah sort of a general question that relates both to sort of councils global storm water discharge consents end to Eakins responsibilities for water quality and and the stacks river etc so it 'll be kind of I don 't know whether they 'll need a consent for that it 's very possible that they would need through the ECAM consents for various aspects of the development though in regard to water and discharge off contaminants okay so it to sign off each i said i think this beast years so we I don 't think from your move actually signed off the room one will have work right and again the terminology should include and associated section 32 report so you would prefer that we go through each of the subcategories under the specific zones inside mafia as opposed to one blanket one at the years please okay well with respect to wear em up thing if you just pop up there a little bit I don 't think we hit a mover and seconder we didn 't care either the workroom one okay so move Tim Andrew you every second all those in favor say aye aye aye opposed carried and and I just bring to your notice of course it needs to include section 32 for all of them as well yeah and we 've also done Gulf the golf resort self resort here so I 'll move that term as Englishmen so maybe Paul will see conduct all those in favor say aye aye opposed to carry I think so now we 'll just move and glenda will deal with those as well again I don 't have anything really to add to my earlier presentation but I 'm obviously happy to answer any questions any questions on the stalls I 'll sir john terry that 's tertiary education one does it went to get one lose one 's own or two secret zones there is that one zone or two separate zones it 's all part of the tissue education zone but because of the fact that is an effectively three chunks of land now of split up the definition of sight that 's but complicated but there was an issue was whether the dove Dale so it was part of the overall site the purposes of activities I think it is because we 're talking about his the UC land as a whole for the purposes of things like parking requirements we 're looking at each block separately so it 's a little bit different to the norm and so in terms of dovetail which tends to operate quite differently than the rest of the block but they 're using it as their at the moment witnesses stating a new crossing and what are the parking requirements on that site are they the same as the sort of 12 20 on that or whatever it was on the main site I 'm really not the expert on parking that 's under the transport chapter I think they are the same pretty much I guess one of the concerns about parking on dovedale was to do with the fact that the university actually charges for a lot of the parking so that 's probably the reason that they need a lot of spell over on two adjoining streets and so in what way does the new district plan address the issues that the university has created in that neighborhood a talking parking issues are we talking other issues and parking issues for a start and then what 's allowed to be developed on the dovetail campus I can 't really answer the parking question that will have to be David Falconer I sleeping on and you see his I thought we can bring them back yeah with regard to the activities on the site us to secure fire watch activities can I help in there and I think that that 's pretty much up to the University but what i have done is try to look at the belt standards so that we are sure that we can try and mitigate the effects on neighbors of the buildings it 's in terms of things like dipping get heights from the boundaries etc I think it 's a bit harder to actually control has I see what the University chooses to do there i referred you i think in the earlier discussion to the fact that they 're now not proposing to put all of the hostel accommodation proposed hustle accommodation for the future on that site some of its going to be over at montana if so that 'll probably reduce the total scale on the dovetail site but they 're still looking at putting a couple of quite large blocks of hostels on the dovedale site but slightly feed it in and towards the center of the site rather than not then on the corners are we just relying upon the good planning I think that them is for the other education sites we 're interested in the immunity of the neighbors and we have C X we have height controls in stepping back of heights as i was saying and have also put in another rule about sort of alcohol being supplied or not actually in this case not being supplied at all on that site between the hours of 11 and 7 there 's a sort of a complementary role in the general rules and procedures chapter about with on 75 meters of residential zones so that 's kind of almost as far as I think that I can go I just don 't feel that I can address all of those issues some of them are behavioral issues well some of them a university behaviorial issues as well so how do we know it so have you put a set back from the street in terms of large potential developments that we faced like 18 months ago or a year ago when they wanted to put a very large hostile right a console way yeah but yet we 've got also because of the stepping up of heights I 've forgotten the figures i have to look it up the you can only have like effectively I think that 's might be 12 meters sort of behind that and then through the run you can go up to 16 if I remember correctly so it 's trying to push this sort of the bulkier buildings further in potentially so yeah but I 'm not a way that there was actually a proposal to put a building on that corner anymore no no no I know there 's not this week but I 'm just trying to make sure that this lasts our wee bit longer than next week hmm sure I am Not sure that I am convinced that the threat to residents as quite as bad as they might consider it to be and that that might or could justify stronger controls and elsewhere and we already have situations with the University in adjoining neighbors which are kind of effectively the same at least these residents to have the road and between yeah that 's that 's another problem agree with what you 're saying I do take my dog-walking dear as a high amenity site but short of actually putting an inter some sort of open space zone it 's it 's quite difficult and teaching individual Norris trees the problem but what I 'm just so the university 's plans have changed at least four times since I 've been involved in in the council side of it and and what I 'm trying to get is some sort of reasonable restriction because obviously the the six or eight story building immediately facing a single-story result it 's not really six or eight stories but how evolved meters is what well it would potentially be about three stories three storms within 13 meters could we potentially set that back slightly more or do we break every other planning sure we could they did have a I have to say a 15 meter sit back and the operative city plan I thought that was kind of a little but out of line with the rest of the setbacks for all of the schools in other other tertiary institutions reader made it more liberal in that regard but actually more restrictive with regard to the heights okay so could we find a happy medium that we live it back at 15 and leave it at the height that you 're suggesting well that would be as a package more restrictive than the current comes Jeter and it doesn 't doesn 't provide any more flexibility for them at the moment there are mum knocking that we do yeah at the moment they 're pushing their coverage on that site because in the tertiary education zone the definition of coverage included impervious surfaces in their kind of right up against it so I thought that was important to give them a little bit of flexibility in terms of shifting buildings around you know within all of their sites all right so there 's effectively a suggestion or an amendment from from vikki as their you sort of support around the table for that or wanting to obviously for exactly but does anyone else feel the same as it away it though sayani as well all right I 'm and I huge area of that dovetail campus especially along so where it is just Asheville that 's right it 's not even used for car park because they actually apart from charging don 't provide any means of paying for the attacks either so you drive in there and then you actually have to go to the cafe to get your ticket to come back and put it on your ticket on your car before you go and have your cup of coffee so I mean they have some really unusual practices and that takes up a lot of the bulk of the area they also have some very large areas of single storey buildings some of which are legacy from the winery 20 in that block that unlimited is currently occupying and that are very very old prefabs and well I mean talk about Sweeting the equity in those and they have and that 's fine but looking at this this is the rest of saw waves very low density usually single story on the other side of the road and the residents have been incredibly concerned about the possibility the quad is a kind of a green campus area there at the moment yeah well they already had a 20-metre maximum height and the operative plan and they don 't actually have very many buildings that are that high I think probably none of them most that i recall looking at was about four stories and so i have an increased that at all is a set of decreased a fine with that tore down little of the campus just on the edge of that camp is long so away and probably pack stone and just that we actually step that back and if we can keep it at the 15 I think that 's livable worth with that hmm I think some of the difficulty at the moment is you know is the temporary consents the blocks via I 'm not even worried about those those will go away eventually for sure that 's just leaving a legacy of what was a very nice green area and I appreciate the university has got a whole lot of imperatives and they 're trying to do the best they can take it closer to the road rather than leaving it where it was I like your idea of height they sort of having to step back I just think if we can leave that at 15 meters rather than 10 yeah bring like it if we if we do that as I said we 're being more restrictive overall but it 's actually not in conflict with their current plans website well it may be if they say I 'm not to put their coverage beyond the current I think it 's forty percent what I just feel we go in circles we were here I 've heard the staff response they really can 't_''_1250.08 can 't_''_1250.29 defeat it you 've got a view though which is which is different to that it 's effectively an amendment that you 're proposing which is that you go slightly lower 15 meters was a sorry just the sex abuse cocaine but the height as remains the specific is 15 so you think only want to keep the the operative plan is really what do you mean was that component of that component 'll put that to a vote all those in favor of the amendment say i I 'm sorry sorry totally totally wrong process there Jimmy seconds there so when I 'm moving a second vote all those in favor say aye i hosed no um put that to a diversion of hits okay what scary was it nope it was well hope put your hand up a few or not I was an eye looks bad even to me all right ok so that 's Carrie um all right it 's carried that now becomes the substantive which is effectively that component which is V between please just make it 15 meters not what 's in the operative plan so 15 meters yes that the sit back be changed from 10 to 15 meters right from so I am okay so we 'll continue on with questions there I 've got I think Jimmy has a question and also yarny has a question I need to leave now so Jimmy is now cheering and over to you when cruising is said to the say bacon of the Vicki doshi particular have another kind of the in order for instance i got noise have any the setting up any kind of criteria because the tablet or a were many for the student accommodation it 's a tool rather than for the nature in so as you increase now the noise rose the around nose controls in the general rules chapter X chapter six they cover a receipt of noise and the residential zones for those apply so we 've been through eighth chapter morning yeah I saw the photo Council have any more patient any peace okay so just go to the University site I see that you 've on the map it would appear that you 've taken zoning over montana ave my understanding was that some of that was residential um it 's a lineup of houses but all of them by 10 actually owned by the university right but it is a residential Galilee so as any other education landed um that 's currently residential dat your reasoning education um a couple of houses one and on the sort of just back from kirkwood eggs at the University any other schools and stuff like some of the private schools there are some schools that of court houses adjoining to expend on two adjoining residential land and in many cases that 's happened it 's a continuation of trends anyway is that 's already happened in the past and so we 're the school has for example they locked down the house and made you know put a building across several titles which included and a title that it was it was originally as a you know a residential title there is now resigned to school zone because it is effectively being used as part of a school site so the questions that you 're asking now relate to the special purpose school zones rather than the University are there any more questions on the University idea okay well i hope i guess i can 't see that the logic and reasoning there even if they i know its residential and we need housing in the city so they 've got heaps of space on the campus to build stuff well i don 't actually have heaps of space they are starting to have shoes and you know they want to keep the team for it consents along cool Eve and things like that because they 'll be losing various little pods eventually and you know they 're juggling all the time so i think they don 't actually have heaps of space given that they want to keep that sort of park like setting and we want them to keep that as well so yeah I mean I don 't know it 's a prison there but um just the polity you 've got permitted activities to ninety percent on the majestic site is that is it what 's currently in the operative plan or is it yeah that 's on the operative plan at the moment I haven 't been able to get accurate figures for the current coverage but it 's probably no II need it and what 's the requirement for parking car park it politic ya see that they don 't have a requirement as a result of the central city recovery plan alright so and we can adjust that because we 're not out we do as part of security that fits the secret question really a man has two doors the christchurch central recovery plan i know but i mean even even the special papers own for the polytek because it 's in the central city we can 't we can 't do it today um I haven 't covered parking at all in these for specific purposes zones because it 's covered in rejected parking the recession immunity what he 's saying is I omegle City chapter as a standalone chapter so the special the specific purpose and Sugarland single City chapter it shouldn 't be signed off today oh okay yeah it does the central city tertiary education sites which is just a seaport site and address street is in the central city chapter okay so when it comes back I won 't waste any more time today around these school sites that are not T cherie oh that nitesh so even the tertiary one but in the school there 's central city schools as well they sure you 're quite right I 'll come back the special purpose the the city center and what 's in the rest of the zone they excrete it should be split yeah at the moment there was a little bit of duplication and some of those documents range it should be earlier than one so this chapter will now be split the is PZ tertiary education in the ESPYs heed schools for the parts that need to go into the central city center will go in there chapter and the other parts will go out as part of the stage to TM and the final question for me on this one is like Walston school for example you haven 't_''_1688.409 encroached any school zones into parks or reserves or I don 't know not sure it 's very they don 't own it I mean essentially the school zones are defined by the ownership like by ministry of education or whatever so you 've only we 've only got designs been resigned where they own it and they 've had a traditional use of Education mmm or else that you know they are intending to use it for school buildings or whatever okay which ones they are intending to use they bring the ministry of education or ya know that ministry of education is not normally the one that 's expanding its usually the private schools right that 's that 's my concern is that schools are buying up residential property and creating all sorts of traffic and amenity issues for local neighborhoods um not necessarily so cuz often you know it 's just part of the overall site it doesn 't add anything to traffic right I think if they took people around the inner city would have a different view but I don 't know if there 's any others outside of the central city that on that situation well the ones that I 'm aware of they 've already been expanding over time and all i 'm doing is recognizing their fee that they 've already expended it 's kind of like a post situation but yeah as I said it depends on what they 're doing with that lean because if they 're building some great but I don 't know performance center or something like that it probably traffic there could but if it 's just normal teaching space that 's probably kind of just more specialized spaces or you know same number of pupils so that depends thanks okay so can II you would like to amend them at least well no no it 's it 's fun because the center study stuff will come back and the polytek with them that 's right but we have to make a resolution to say that that under the spz teacher education zone those areas that are located within the central city go in the central city chapter or and similarly under the schools and then you 're quite right then they come back to as part of that chapter thank you so are there if any no more questions or we carry the next one alright thank you Ivan 's going to talk to you about the waste management special specific purpose own stick smell and that Wigram isn 't know the room has been done like it but the sticks mill zoning is a its specific purpose ohm which really reflects the transfer station out of sticks 's basically just been carried over from the operative plan and to ensure that that facility thinkin you can cooperate so more than happy just to recommend that to them to the minister as it as it is has no changes proposed okay thank you so crazy day yeah for you thanks mr. Chu so there 's been no we just did complaints or anything about there as far as i know i 'm not them aware of no thank you are there any more questions Napoleon would like to move or I 'll bother the re you 'll have to sacred all those in favor say aye okay no Carrie that 's why yeah I on your Jane the counselors there is the waste management specific with the Sun yet specific the the waist worthless waste management there that 's the board landfill site now remember this morning we when we were talking about the general City rules we had a reference to landfill which I took out so what 's happening is that that booooored landfill is becoming a park and that because the landfill actually the case it will become a pack so the resolution for that will be probably part of the oak welcome part of the open space resolution because it 's going to be a I community open space community park so so sorry now can I change the resolution please instead of what 's there under one to say that the specific purpose zone has been deleted has been deleted and the Burwood landfill area will be included in the open space chapter yeah it 's not a special purpose own anymore and I 'm saying that boys yeah yeah there could be either either conjunction that 's right okay are there are more questions regarding to this issue no so the panini you like to move about a second okay so all those in favor say aye okays of carry next item cemeteries freeze it sorry oh really um some specific purpose cemeteries own I 've had three changes since this chapter has been or this topic has been to to you first is the use of the term passive recreational activities in one of the objectives we provide we mentioned that there has been an issue with the definition of the class of recreational activities whereas some of those activities are not appropriate for the cemetery so we 've changed it to the term passive cemetery activities so that was one change and then a second one it 's on the table where I have a list of all the cemeteries within the city and banks peninsula so I 've removed the Barbados cemetery which will now go into the Central City chapter and also the boundary of the Littleton Catholic and public cemetery has been extended because they have recently or that our green space assets network team have recently acquired from the land adjacent to it so just those changes and any proposed amendments would fall under the general blanket amendments in any loquacious so yeah um well this is on the paper it 's under planning mapping on I 've got here the feminist winger Littleton yep it 's funny number number 52 got the planning lips specific it was cemetery oh it 's blocked out but um it 's the top the top um parcel there 's and they spc per row right hand corner yeah the extreme right the extreme right purple spc that 's the Littleton public Catholic and public Cemetery also the week you would like to move yeah how about into let 's move okay and then pour you like the second okay thank you low in to move and the poor second all those in favor say aye against abstention carry the next item all right now we have the specific paper sport zone and there might be related questions here with their recovery plan de vez person on both of those topics good afternoon and so just jumping straight into it so the purposes the specific purpose Livington ports owners of course to provide for operational port activities with a key focus on recovery which has been the the lens that has been used to develop this chapter so a number of changes to the rules have been made since the previous version you saw in January and these changes have really reflected counselor feedback as well as ongoing discussions with ich an as part of aligning the district plan provisions key changes include some clarification about the appropriate limits in scale thresholds that apply to retail and office activity in the proposed NPO Bay Area so this was the area of the port where eventually they know they will no longer require for port operational activities as they move to the east and that frees up the area for improved public access in a range of activities associated with it and so those thresholds are now reflected within the provisions before you just in response to questions in January and we 've included the limitation on the height of container stacks along Norwich key so previously they were unlimited and their height which reflected the rest of the port operational area so in response to those concerns raised we 've imposed a height limit of 15 metres so this is designed to match the height limit of buildings along that frontage so container stacks to go no higher than 15 metres along that frontage and and as one of the other key changes and this really is in response to the fact that there is a recovery plan process going port zone and that we 've now included provisions relating to transport and hazardous substances within the port zone as opposed to relying on other chapters that the main chapters within which they sit for the rest of the plan and the reason being is just in terms of getting caught up and the recovery plan district plan process so we 've included them with them chapter now since the chapters were finalized for the edge in today 's agenda the littleton port recovery plan working party had a meeting yesterday and that was their opportunity to have a look through these plan provisions before today and as a result of discussions and concerns raised at that meeting of proposed some amendments to take account of those concerns and they 're contained in the resolutions before you so just going through them there was some discussion around whether or not the recovery plan was going to determine the outcome of with a passenger ferry terminal is to be located whether it 's an existing it 's in its existing location or a new location and dampier Bay so in order an amendment to a policy that deals with the management areas and activities and the proposal is to delete any reference to that passenger ferry terminal so that it 's kind of taken out of the policy framework context that sits in the district plan and it will still be provided for and the ability to provide for it is really what we 're trying to cover off in the in the zone and there were also some other references just to ensuring that any excess whether it be produced rhian cycling or vehicle is also direct and between the town centre end dampier bay in particular so where those references have occurred namely and policy relating to access and movement networks that 's part be a point to up there and also it occurs in a matter of discretion so I 'll propose some amendments to take account of those concerns that were raised yesterday and then the fourth resolution is just consequential amendments I to section 32 there was a few guests that have occurred so I intend to plug those gaps okay thank you regarding to a good okay thank you please you 're talking about in relation to the hazards chapter and rock fall has it is correct it does yes but we have it good yeah i 'm just going to say that 's currently a matter before the hearings panel yeah with the hazards chapter you might really cleaned up the hearings starting on the second of march so we really can 't discuss that here no problem sorry dear and we have to undermine that no no no so that line stands the Zoners providing for activities and the hazards chapter will come on top of that subject to here 's a chapter has some overlay that says we 're prohibited where the probative liners um is there any other reason cancel our tuna may wish to add to their Tanya please if I 'm like thank you this is one of the things that will land as a result of the recovery plan and there 's a conversation very much still going on we can around the position of the ferry terminal the port view is that it should land at dhampir it is there was a working party that came up with a conclusion that the ferry terminal should stay where it was there are some documents have been put together by the port which we 're currently sending reports back to the port on which some of the information is dubious if ya is is questionable put it that way it 's a big conversation and we thought it was better if this chapter didn 't prejudge the outcome of that by making assumptions okay thank you yanny who 's on the pork pork working party there 's there any external representatives no it 's made up consists of councillors I counselor lonsdale Turner and chin and community board members all right so I 'm just kind of wondering how but has support of hebei or anywhere we consult with them over what this sign is and so just coming back to process so just we are running under two different processes here so we have our district plan review process which is this item before you now and the recovery plan process is also running concurrently and that is the recovery plan you can staff and myself have worked alongside to develop a set of district plan provisions that we will notify and that will be included and the recovery plan that he can notifies now the basis of all this information was a requirement under the minister 's direction on the recovery plan that little to import company provide a package of information to e can so that he can can then develop the recovery plan so we have used that as a basis to develop these provisions so was essentially LPC presented their view we 've taken that and adapted it into a council he can view and then that will then go out for submissions under both processes is there anything that we would put on there that the port wouldn 't be happy with that we would actually do because it makes sense for the silly ah there are a number of things in there and that they 're not particularly happy with but there are reasons why we have done those things like at dampier Bay in terms of restrictions or particular requirements around a certain way there was some unease around some aspects of Sutton key so we 've included activity statuses to ensure that they provide or at least go through a consent process to ensure that the relevant assessment of effects is undertaken so there are some things that they aren 't won 't be happy with but they are done from an overarching strategic community perspective Thanks okay I 'll hear any more questions so if no entra poop are you happy to move so we keep you happy to second ok so the end remove and the week is second all those in favor say aye okay so kari next item in the last specific paper sign as hospitals object chester hi so the hospital zone the hospital chapter really and the main drivers have been about sorting out the purpose of this so so what kind of facilities we in them and also looking accepting that these sites are going to need to be intensified going forward they can 't keep expanding so trying to give the hospital providers more flexibility about type of buildings and the scale that we 've had in terms of these hospital buildings being built right up next to residential boundaries and causing issues along there so there 's been there 's originally about 24 sites within this zone so we 're taking that down to nine so we 're going to focus on just the larger hospitals the idea being the other sites were actually more retirement villages with a on site kind of medical side of it and what we 're proposing to do is resign those as residential in which case when they 're consented and looked at they 'll be better fitting to their context which is residential area so so going forward we 've looked we 've tried to simplify the rules for the hospitals that we 're keeping in this zone and we 've originally there was a lot of different site specifics for the sites we 've tried to group the hospitals so we 've got the ones that are in our suburban areas like bare wood and hillmorton a kind of more campus greener hospitals and we 've got the inner urban ones and it main hospital site in the town as well so what we 've tried to do is get groups of rules so it 's a bit simpler when you 're reading it to kind of understand the type of environment within each of these hospitals so as a general rule in a bit like we sought to do in the tertiary one is we 've tried to say you can go higher if you 've got a site you can build higher buildings bigger buildings in the middle of the sites but at the edges next to the residential areas we 're going to seek setbacks and only smaller buildings so that that 's been the general philosophy there so in order to try and do that we 've also addressed the definitions so the hospital definition kind of focused on the medical things originally now what we 've done is it 's more an activity-based definition so it 's clear about what you can do you know accepting hospitals need a bit of rd office that those kind of activities and the health care definition are also proposing to amend under the health care definition so it 's just clarifying what we 're seeking with those two things I know Ivan brought this one to you first of all but there weren 't any big changes since that but there are some amendments that we 're seeking today with just to correct things up really so the first one is the old definition was what you saw the new definition obviously needs to go in there and like I said that 's to reflect greater flexibility for the hospitals and to sort out that issue with retirement homes the second correction is that there 's have been a wrong height rule inserted relating to internal boundaries so instead of reading that it should be read as 18 meters they can go build to 16 meters from the smell I at the moment so you might need to read good out okay yeah I 've got that done and the third correction should i do that one no I can come to you with the exact wording for that second one okay recommended that the rule amendment a new amendment please there at the height one now Sarah this one just said it was going to be update okay and the third change is just to make some additions to the section 30 do just to add in some of the rationale for some of these proposals packages so we just need to get rid up apologies there 's been a miscommunication so let 's go in the staff typing the crisis are there any other questions or temp chris can you remember anything do you know who knows sorry she 's just trying to find you out where you 're relating which one are you sorry Oh 30 to lift it sorry don 't base your hospital sorry and say again page yep yes that 's correct yeah that 's right so if the rezoning of this get takes place and their residential areas the definition of retirement home is about providing independent care and facilities for on-site residents what so that hopefully address that issue okay so apart from existing rights but new ones would not they would be covered in it okay thank you again any more pressure the central city staff will be deleted important to the central city justified be here quite great we need a resolution rd for h 31 comprehensive redevelopment of development of Princess Margaret for residential purposes that 's right why would that be in this area why wouldn 't we just deal with that throw normal residential chapter like why would we give them special treatment yes we we thought about this one a lot the the idea was that you know they 've confirmed to us that the beginning of 2060 and they want to sell that on for residential and but so this is really triggering that that 's going to happen and we 'd expect that 's why there 's also a policy in there about what we 'd like to see there and accepting that yes some form of residential on that site would work oh like I 'm not happy for that to be in this chapter I don 't think we need to pray a special purpose hospital zone for a residential development it doesn 't seem very fair I think what needs to happen process so this is my move a resolution that we delete it or what how do I deal with that I don 't understand moment does it plug Boone well they 've 2016 use airspace back clear because it will probably limit than the rightful local neighborhood to be no fine it 'll probably limit a number of things that you might want to consider if you were doing a residential might make it easier to have some quiet ghastly development I mean who knows but that 's what I can 't see why you would I can 't see that you can just roaming a special-purpose hospital zone if it 's intended to be residential I 'm sorry so yeah yeah he 's consider this early didn 't we are now look the two or three issues here they 'll do with the design one first it 'll be restricted discretionary activity and it would be it depend on the effects whether it be notified or not and so there 's still possibility have been notified the issue around designer that does trigger an urban design rule and a that consent in terms of a number of criteria and the balusters than the assessment matters the the first question was the last Jack of thing well I think counselor your hands and asked why are we including in this chapter because that although there 's been speculation in the media I think some one or two statements from the hospital board that they do intend to close Princess Margaret we still do not know yet whether it 's gotta be fully closed it could be partially closed i might hold on to some of it so what this rule does it gives us some flexibility it doesn 't actually make it a doesn 't corner so we lifted a specific purpose and then didn 't actually have an underlying zoning then anything that the canterbury hospital board did if they do close Princess Margaret all part of it it would there be a non-complying activity or acquire a plan change now what this rule does it enables the hospital board too close either some of it or partially some of it and they still got the flexibility to decide makes the a lot smoother transition to any form of residential development whether it 's for the full site or part of the site so it really it 's really just a strategic way of keeping the options open so that whatever happens it doesn 't put the Canterbury hospital board through and unwieldy process but at the same time safeguard enables our consent planners to assess it from an urban design perspective and decide whether or not to publicly notify it well it doesn 't meet the objective of this policy it 's really clear health care providers are able to develop existing hospital facilities an efficient and effective manner so you provide for healthcare facilities as I said so it doesn 't even make the objective so I really struck out in here and I guess the other question I have us as it a listed heritage building forgotten I know yeah I just yeah I you know a number of people could could could want special treatment for things that might happen in the future but I don 't know if that 's a very good way of pleasure which the purpose the objective could be in tweak a little bit they could cover that off but that 's what the council wants to do there isn 't a popular as a policy there that about alternative use doesn 't hang off objective is it cuz I 'm yeah that 's wrong yes the objective is that the what we want to do the sort of strategic direction you might say the policy is how we 're going to do it okay feel please yeah well it just sounds like that might need some fine-tuning more so were they objected and the objective includes pepsis I think Ivan 's point about this being the need for a transition is really important we 're still going to look after sick people and elderly people at pmh and people with me to illness as part of a transition but my main question we was around the this and i 'm not sure what page was reading it last night but we 're this new healthcare sort of facilities like as it is the section on parking going to cater of cars and so do the staff so I 'm just wondering if we got that sort of tied up 9,000 staff not all the one side if so it 's all parking requirements are on the phase I 'm transferred captor and they are subject submissions and so there you go to the hearing in June so that that 's mean or because in further but yes we do have pattern requirements in the phase one is it any requirement around how how they provide parking like does it have to be free or can they church or no we we can 't control whether they charge for it or not we can only control that they provide it that 's the economic right to do what they do with their land which is so we what we are doing with a lot of those major developments is working with them through through trying to work on travel plans and so forth but we can 't through a regulatory framework district plan say they can 't charge so it just seems in terms of the adverse effects and the are just parked on the street and the local neighborhood oh yeah gruesome terms yeah but we charge for parking on our patterns light sweet we can 't tell a private development that they start judge it 's not as outside its repetitive and just when it comes back fort health that will be included in each chapter no we 're not going to and that 's already provided for through the central city recovery plan zoning it 's um it 's in a zone that enables health facilities and things to go in so it 's already covered off okay yes ishment view hospital it 's on the rules of us okay so this is a silencer some section 327 okay the second last page yep so basically the proposed zoning is residential so not nearly cute Tilly centers so not justified for resource management no no the virtual this was sort of a working document here so we wondered about putting a residential medium density on the site given the scale of the residential units and things on the block but um it 's surrounded by residential suburban so that 's the proposed zoning yeah when we change it from the hospital so so regarding to a hospital issue are there any more questions you know the yani are your hope he knows we cut into sarah answer all you still insist on the hepers an amendment no okay let 's go so few are you happy to move on with you yet oh you move your second okay so turn the move and the fear of second all those in favor say aye are against Kerry thank you I just like to move back to the cemetery special a specific purpose zone and add that same clause that the cemetery is located within this central city within city area be located in the central city chapter it 's correct that 's good so if you 're happy with that that resolution and stand as amended okay and then there are just a couple of last general recommendations for that particular chapter and they 're really just to cover minor amendments in fact I think some of these are repeats but it 's good to have that there these are just general or general recommendations to allow for minor amendments and additions to the section 32 report okay thank you so the clean are you happy to move and Paul are you second okay all those in favor say aye against Kerry so we just have two more chapters and then definitions and maps to go the two chapters are the biggest ones I don 't know if you would like to break for afternoon tea now and come back to do that okay yeah so I 'll see you 10 minutes 15 okay yeah we 'll break for 15 minutes so please speak to the council chamber is a five pastor street thanks I 'll pass the three _"

    "text": "substances chip 12 since you last see this chapter last month um well this is one of my chapters again with them heavy technical input and so since you 've not seen this I have received illegal comments and as advice from my technical expert and we have agreed to make some amendments and one of these is um just on one of the objectives we had so the difference from your previous version is that one of the objectives were split into two so it 's the objectives there it was just went into two with a different headings that was to do with the reverse sensitivity affects just to make it stand out more and then another is any reference to avoid risk we have replaced that with minimize risk for consistency and then in the p2 and p3 rules in the permitted activity rules about explosive substances we have clarified that it only applies to the group 3 which is the residential group the sensitive one sensitive to hazardous activities in the threshold table and in a description of the subclass categories are also inserted there to the more sensitive zone was has been deleted as per legal advice we have already included a note under that table I think it 's note 12 which gives us the an explanation of the order of the zone groups according to sensitivity to hazardous substances so just those changes that have been made from the previous version to this other one other than that proposed amendments are covered under the blanket general amendments just as numbering and updating a section 32 and probably I would correct the title of the chapter there it 's hazardous substances and contaminated land chapter because we also have a stage two of contaminated land included so yep the avoid risk versus minimize risk can you just repeat for me where that was going to go in in relation to what Oh using the objectives and policies because some were written as avoid risk and then the others were mostly was to minimize risk and the legal view was set to make it consistent we just use one which is the minimize risk but why don 't we use a void with in the avoid em to minimize risk because um it 's it 's rather that we we allow the activity but we have to manage the activity there and minimize the risk not to generally avoid it wouldn 't we be better to actually avoid the risk well to avoid there a school together because we can 't always say what 's going to concern a risk would mean having no hazardous substance rules allowing no sighs hazardous substances anywhere in the city and that 's not appropriate so we can 't avoid the risk all together point is that if substances are we actually talking about um in is this doesn 't these are hazardous substances as in our definition here as those which are flammable and explosive capacity to oxidize yes yes yes a lot of those yeah so it 's more appropriate ocean to minimize the risk rather than avoid well they seem relatively straightforward changes and they 've got a bit of a clarity around their last definition are there any questions from anyone is that a hazardous substance there yes there but they are covered under them under chapter 21 there 's a specific purpose port zone and we 'll have a discussion of it over then okay thanks nixle i 'll move this one seconded by paul was in favor say aye I married oh you 've moved so speedily we have and its present _"

    "text": "okay one you 've all been waiting for subdivisions development yeah yeah there 's only been one changed since you saw this last anita 's on page five so you don 't have page numbers at the bottom of table 2 and all that 's done is to air design that was forgotten to be included so dense air design and a minimum lot size for that and that is the only change but you wanted me to talk to you about cycleways and so this earlier David talk to you about the construction standards and that 's one aspect now I 'm going to talk to you about how we 're requiring cycleways through the subdivision chapter and so there are some directors and policies which sit out the need for cycleways and in multimodal transport and if it was two objectives and we have four or five policies that talk about those things I 'm sure okay now subjective 8100 no this is from phase 1 sorry so you won 't have it in front of you so there is an objective on design and amenity which talks design and resilience it talks about cycleways is a further policy on integration and connectivity which talks about cycleways so there 's some others as well Lee but by providing direction for the consents planners when they get an application for a reasonable size subdivision they can look at these and say this name was asked to to look at it having cycleways included for example in a green fields area at a flawed to a closer and level and there are no rules requiring cycleways but there are assessment matters so at six and eight point three pointer which is access we 'll probably access there are four assessment measures which which relate to cycle ways and it gives the council the ability to require and those three congestive consent or three by three negotiated an outline plans and other planes specific to the new neighborhoods zone now again there are no specific rules but there are no egg in a raft of assessment methods that talk about cycle bays and when and where and how we might do those enable us to to get those and sorry I context playing a site plane and ER some other kind of plan which I forget the name of and they all talk about cycleways and transport as well so there 's plenty of scope for us to negotiate those things and where we want them and how we want them so not necessarily along sides of roads but they could be through through the subdivision away from them or sit back from the road and where that 's appropriate so just to reiterate a lot of what 's been asked this morning has actually gone through under stage one the stage two chapters subdivision lyrics chapter deals just with the new zones and putting in place the subdivision development and earthworks rules for the new zones that are going through stage two so in the assessment matters for the new neighborhoods zones are the same for the living g which is part of phase two so that will put those season is relevant to cycleways will be relevant to livin g as well one so you happy sigh questions now yes ok I 've got Jimmy Haitian hotter difference between is chapter 22 concept plan for the future urban given what 's a difference the difference is that this what this does provide for that zone is well the future urban development zone as I guess putting that those areas of lane specifically into a holding pattern in saying that it 's not that it can 't_''_253.04 be developed but we prefer it not to be whereas this in the provisions in this you can go and do a subdivision in that particular zone it 's at a higher activity status there are provisions specifically around how you would do that and the future when their areas not sones they 're not zones yani Takimoto and Robinson 's by comprehensive development areas yeah I know that you 've got a lot of controls there and just wonder whether you 've done an assessment versus the statement of expectation and so that you know the developers because this is the kind of stuff that we 're removing from a number of other parts of the plan but as being put in here which is quite quite restrictive and you said there areas like this where there 's been an extensive decision through another process that we 've been somewhat reluctant to dabble with too much and too there 's been community involvement in on these things previously and and to go back in to relitigate there and we 've tried to avoid that unless there 's a good reason to do so so I mean I really like what you 've got them there about there and I 'd love to see that important to the other character areas but we seem to be taking those things out yeah well we 're not including them we were doing new character areas and that 's the problem with deleting some of those is that the people have bought land or owned land around there have a set of expectations and need to go and take those away and makes it difficult before they mean for and for us and lease is a good reason to do so and I think that some of these provisions in terms of landscape on the peninsula and are warranted in some of these areas exhale but move that we do something similar around the port hills loving bones because that 's what the community of us will previously and yeah I don 't see why we couldn 't do it how are you asking or in the poor house zones where you get new residential development that is a set of I don 't know what you call these things Rome 's guidelines yeah assessment matters similar to tech mature in Robinson 's back yeah I 'm and I 'm not a landscape architect i think that the port hills is a different environment from some parts as the the peninsula whether we 're talking about tech marian Robinson space with small small areas where they generally not very built up at the moment and wouldn 't be even through these plans whereas the broad homes has got quite a substantial amount of development and a lot of the air is due to be developed or with our provisions include landscaping for example on the port hills rather than the colors of your building but they don 't include some things to some hit down the it 's too late for us to do anything to change this residential zone at the stage so there are two options you can either choose to hold back the residential and and it come back to you at the same time that we look at the others the natural hazards and that the cultural heritage or we can do some further work on this to see whether or not it is in fact feasible to add and more defined rules like this for the port zone and you put that in as a submission what health as a submission so there are two other ways of getting around this this issue or not around it but but dealing with this issue either hold it back or put it in as a submission either way we certainly couldn 't make the decision today because we 've done no well I 'm not aware of any analysis being done to include such detailed rules like this across the entire port hills residential zones they um put in a submission do you mean as a council yes you might recall that once also make a submission to change something okay that 's been notified well there might be no point in doing that if there isn 't the support fell for that change anyway well so happy as I say the residential chapter as its come to you now has come to you for a reason and it doesn 't include those rules or if you 're asking us to now look at potentially highly detailed rules for their whole area of the portholes we would need to be careful no I appreciate anything look is there a well from the from the committee or the council to hold it back we 'll put on a submission notice on here quaterback no I don 't think it 's getting majority favored they 'll Annie well well no but what I 'm saying is is it you can still put this chapter through is not this chapter i 'm talking about the residential chapter and then in the meantime we 'll look at instead of it it further and potentially if there is the ability to add such detailed rules will put it or anything around that or are you just done no no i 've just made a note that will come back on it because we look at it at that time i 'll pull sorry i just want to know what putting a whole little rules on the port hills for future development what that 's going to cause well that 's exactly why i 'm suggesting we take away we look at the possibility and if if it 's appropriate we can bring it to you as a change through a submission once it snowed you know after these chapters are notified okay all right well I 'm to even move it for us for no one to remove

    "text": "oh I own some senior planner good afternoon the future and development areas chapter this chapter proposes a new zoning a future urban development zoning for 380 hectares at hall 's wall and a 60 hit deer area at East Belfast this zoning is proposed as a transition zoning between the current rural zoning and a residential zoning and why should we go in these areas this way well we 're suggesting this is the way that we need to interpret the direction from the land use recovery plan and the Canterbury regional policy statement that identifies these areas amongst a number of others as greenfield areas for future residential development now these areas are new to the council they 're identified in both the council 's southwest area plan and it 's Belfast area plan is future growth areas and also in the urban development strategy for greater Christchurch and as part of all that those area plans and the UDS there was considerable community consultation so it 's not new to the communities either and with that we 've got a lot of technical research that supports this on that with extra information geotechnical and land contamination research both desktops studies and also ground testing so we know that these areas are prone to liquefaction they 've got high water tables but these are that are you know short coming and the type of land can be addressed through proper land treatment at the time of development what the land use recovery plan and the regional policy statement say is that the council 's able to stage development in these areas and that 's another reason why we 're proposing not to zone these areas of the stage residential but to signal that there on that way and call them a future urban development area the other reason is that we 've got analysis that shows that we 've got plenty of land zoned for residential devour and of the 20,000 odd year residential sites earmarked for future zoning through to residential zoning through to 2028 half of those have already been zoned or in the process of being zoned residential and another half of that 10,000 have already obtained subdivision consent so again we 've given this policy statement to stage development so that the council can plan and fund the infrastructure needed for these areas and indeed some of the sewer capacity for their halsell area as being going is going to be considered and as being proposed through our asset management and then your plan process for additional sewage capacity one key feature with this future of and development zone as a provision of concept plans for five discrete areas within the zone these concept plans identify proposed infrastructure and existing infrastructure and other important features such as roads stormwater facility springs reserves heritage items and the lights at the last presentation identified that there are a number of submissions to the halsell area through the stage one chapter process asking that the some of these areas be zoned residential now we 've reflected on that since the last presentation and the major change that we proposed is actually in the subdivision chapter where we are proposing to remove the 4 hectare threshold and effectively set a similar limit to that which is in the residential new neighborhood that way proponents for development through the they can propose a subdivision preserve and as part of the discretionary activity status as long as they provide for the key infrastructure in elements above ground runs like the storm water facilities and roading and reserves then the application will be able to be considered and we think that this will be a major gain in terms of winning over the support of those people that want to greasy development now bearing in mind that there are a number of landowners who still enjoy the rural lifestyle in those areas and want to maintain their rural residential lifestyle thank you thank you um I have died did his cheering but we 'll go with it with regards regards to storm water facilities and then so the Henderson space based on the moment what 's best for there are some already installed but where is you get closer to the Kennedys Bush Road the back or the foot right at the foot of side the south east or south side of Westmoreland it hasn 't been put on you yet we 've got a trail of them going through so it giving those put in the right order if you go so for instance if you go down spikes road and you 're going towards tight it yes on the left hand in the right hand side you 've got storm water basins yes the river the next one that links to as across the fields towards the foothills which isn 't in place it doesn 't place there 's something there in place assume yes there are some there I 'm where of that because we 've consulted with the asset management staff that are have implemented it so there is some there in place just yes I have it then so if you want you as a concept plan I think the way when you 're referring to is 20 point for point five that 's appendix 20 point for point five and so the part of the chapter that 's part of the chapter yep yep yep and I think the area that you 're referring to a few the red outline denotes the boundary of this particular concept plan and the boundary of the future of 're referring to land to the north of from northwest of sparks road where that proposed for residential new neighborhood and it 's whether the sprayed and lodge exempla housing proposals going to choppy so there 's a i understand i 'm aware of driving par see that there is a little bit of stormwater development detention ponds develop their sort of near the mills road area and a little bit of connecting with that is on the other on the south side of sparks road and a little bit of the future urban development zone yes so i guess when we wait for our ticket or we went there and know the ones you can see from sparks road note the greater yep they 're all there and but we were told that the next stage would be the next ones built closer to the bottom of the hell is that correct and if so yes well if you don 't just met if you if you look at the look at the legend and about halfway down the ledge and you 'll see storm would a facility a you then go down and look at the diagram you 'll see one down and the kind of the just east of sutherland so that 's that 's a major facility that councils proposing to develop on that piece of land a farm that they bought about a year ago okay so i think that 's what you 're referring to not other urban future urban development area all only focus on the southwest area plan in the belfast the aeroplane am i right yes yeah how about preston or some other area and well a lot of those and he thought in the new subject areas owned residential or are in the process of being zoned residential through the stage one into chapters yes but we got into info charge of facilities issue i 'd like to follow the tim that his question for instant leg holes were area but there 's kinda of the handles and basing they have flooding issue how to mitigate this situation whether put into this chapter 11 or some other chapter it 's probably recognized through this chapter but it 's also recognized land areas become developed by developers then there 'll be more sort of intensive review of what 's required as part of that so there is required for any residential zoning so that more intensive research will go on in a sort of a staged process so in a sense these are correct me if I 'm wrong concept concept cleanse they 're not actually the rezoning of land yep okay thank you yeah so just we need to start putting affordable and social housing contributions aside particularly these affordable sorry in these future urban development areas so how do we do that like that what would they 've done in Queenstown because clearly we 've got social housing in the city but it 's not becoming this first it 's actually being prevented from going into some of these new subdivisions so when do we get a chance to really look at what what 's being allowed here is weary zona is that the stage or is it next stage it 'll be the next stage grow when it 's the sound yeah these are as I say there what about social housing if the development proposes a subdivision development a new part of the subdivision rules for this apply to this chapter also refers them and the assessment matters to the residential new neighborhood assessment matters so those sort of things that have been considered for new residential zones will also be considered an applicant larger subdivision ahead of the council rezoning these future areas for residential into the future so do we have anything that kind of shows a direction to get affordable social housing in these areas now you might recall that that was an issue that we dealt with in stage one chapters and that didn 't go through as part of the stage one chapters you might recall we had this whole discussion then as part of the residential chapter but this is these are future areas is is is but we 're not zoning them now so we can 't actually and there 's no because they 're not saying these no subject there 's no subdivision consents for these yet either and it 's at that point that potentially you could react like that whole cycleways issue well if you look at them any one of the concept plans counselor you 'll see in the legend that areas for your potential pedestrian and cycle access points are identified they 've kept that reasonably schematic because both the council asset managers and developers like to have some flexibility so they 've just identified the the access points bearing in mind that you know the fictive Lee they 're going to traverse these areas and provide linkages either through parks along stormwater ways or along side roads ok and a final question for me as i 'm about to question one is notable trees have identified any notable trees or significant reason and here that should be flagged so we look at them yeah i think for the most part yep it is is there is one if you actually look at the southeast pools where there was a significant tree identified as part of that exercise so that 's appendix 20.4 point for now they 're not necessarily going to coincide with the same process being used for the natural and cultural heritage as part of the natural and cultural heritage chapter we relating if I trees in these areas that could be protected and in the final question was just in regards to its just social life oh um I 'm kind of concerned about the geotech stuff that we 've done what I can 't_''_786.839 I 'm still having trouble understanding why when we get really bad geotech conditions why would enable these areas to request for the future development areas why I would have thought that that works is to ask like don 't go there because it 's just you know really primed to you know natural natural hazards so poorly and quality flooding etc so as if in any areas within these that have been taken off because the geotech stuff or the assessment just means that it 's not no not at this stage the geotechnical investigation is adequate for rezoning purposes but they 've also acknowledged that more in-depth analysis is needed at the time of subdivision and subsequent to those geotechnical investigations being taken place we 've also starting to build on their information about identified some high hazard areas that 's areas that are subject to deep water ponding and localized flooding events so that sort of information is superimposed on this information and they will all be considered as part of a subdivision application just I just worried that in the past we 've kind of relied on subdivisions to be the current one that flexor when I read the Royal Commission it was really clear that they wanted councils and he can to be much more proactive in prohibiting areas for development that was subject to high natural risks so I personally don 't agree with the approach that we leave it to subdivision consume I don 't we should be doing it now well effectively I 'm suggesting to you that it is being done now but not in this chapter it 's actually yep like any part of the plan we 've got to look at all the chapters more or less together and as part of the stage two natural hazards chapter will be mapping some of these entities in a transitory it 'll be the informational video all is funny but that 's going to happen before we r is over so that yes yes business not a rezoning all right Tim did you have a question did you okay so it 's just you Jimmy yeah are you very asset yeah right do we have any more questions on this excellent um Vicki is happy to move it i think are you say i do Joe actually Jimmy thank you for filling in as certo Jimmy when I was dear I 've got a meeting later this afternoon and Jimmy will take over just for the remainder of the afternoon just that you know so much yep ask a question on that yes sir we 've already passed the resolutions for that but you 're working to ask a question now I just wondered why cuz I thought they were areas that were special or character areas that I can 't see much there the odd a theory has been removed no in fact we 've put areas back in but I thought yes I think it was only the ones and correct me if I 'm where there was actually no possible to export as in red zone properties just going straight and all the river streets were in the era 's character areas but we haven 't just carried them over if they 're if they 've already been undermined we haven 't carried them over but we have two tranches of character areas perhaps FICO take and the names of the streets for you and so it 's the river street saanson albans saloon Tim 's solely on just those toys acknowledging that they run in parallel okay and they run between Westminster and Ernest okay thank you you 've got those dear ok this is move Jimmy seeking to fill all those in favor say aye aye opposed carry thank you very much for that class _"

    "text": "yep seven transport and just if you go belong beyond 12 30 apps made a 12-lead appointments so one of you gets to cure that it fills chocolate I know I know Jimmy is too high all right so much you know Mom David Faulkner and I 've got very best in here who 's also a policy planner who 's been assisting with us so the transport chapter in phase 2 covers essentially what can occur or can occur within Road corridors and rail corridors and destroy any Republic pedestrian areas of the city so we call that the transport zone it 's all public land and we haven 't been to many changes since last movie last brought us to you in January the change that was requested last time was that we make it clear that bus depots are not measured in the rail corridor so we have made amendment to the definition of transport infrastructure to exclude bus depots on outside of road reserve so that they won 't be promoted in the rail rail wheel and that 's really the most times that 's happened no in three paragraphs what are we doing in the transport chapter given that we 've got a whole modal shift that we 're trying to encourage how does this help that so we 're the transport shown is essentially saying that the transport corridors shall be for transport purposes we 're making it clear we called a transport zone as opposed to what previously was just told there was a separate rail zone and separate roads own so we combined them together to say that this is a multimodal transport corridor because we 've got cycleways down rail corridors now and so we 're saying this this whole corridor is for transfer purchases and but by doing that we 're also trying to manage the use of surplus railway line for example which has been a bit of some concern as to some of the to it is it Joe in here so we 're saying no this is for transport purposes and anything else requires our content in this as to enable the transport hurdles to to be used efficiently and and safely the majority of the chapter a few more objectives policies and rules to deal with what David 's just talked about ser desire to achieve modal shift no um but one thing i will bring to your attention please understand it was raised earlier today was about safa lanes and done and sanded so in the operative plan and the road zone which now has been replaced by this transport zone there was standards in terms of how wide a row could be and whether you can put saha lanes on a on a road we 've also got a whole other standards around council as you probably where we 've got the infrastructure design standards which also has requirements softlines we 've got our software design guidelines and with what the major cycleway technical standards there 's a whole lot of international standards as well if you if you 're bored you 're ready to flip through them all say the same thing they did it yeah they also well they all talked about um that we want to provide software facilities on an appropriate locations on on it on our key roads and so forth and are they consistent yeah um we with you can 't find anything nice any of them there are many contrive a bulldozer know whether they have all been written all our centers have been written a lot of international best practice the issue that we have and I know the noble subdivision was raised earlier was that the the operative plan was written in the early 90s it had requirements for for wesnoth alone should or shouldn 't be they so it 's at sea don 't click the roads we didn 't have to put soft loans in since the early 90s best practices has evolved and we 're now saying this we do want to have soft loans on the roads the issue was with enables other version as we head don 't go into the net no just well yeah we had our standard saying we want soft loans on the roads whereas that district plan was still stuck and when it was written in the early nineties in it said we didn 't need them they 're just reply and trumped these other day what we 're now suggesting is that we won 't head low standards in the district plan so that it doesn 't Trump the the standards that we 've written and we don 't want to put these in the district plan because these get updated regularly I know the major software Tintin 's came to you last month and if we put them the district plan like what happened early nineties at lots of the district plan and as standards change over time we can 't change them and we get stuck with with those situations so in terms of the transport stuff I don 't understand how we can 't how we get and then maybe it 's the subdivision stuff we get those new design standards for the place is that they 're frequently what we do yeah so these these new these design standards are in structure design standard right anyone who builds road and wants to vista in council needs to comply with this and so these that that is the way we were we can require safa lanes and so forth and so comply is that basically how it works so if they 've got an outline development plan that doesn 't comply with our standards or an outline development plan it was written you know five years ago and we 've updated us standards what what do they do well we can refuse to to take that road over as a public road and we can say that you can 't miss that road to council road that 's that 's the way that this that we control it for the standard the issue with the previous approach is when we had the standard we also had standards in the district plan that weren 't aligned is that they were saying all the district plans is we don 't need to put soft loans in and so that ended up trumping these standards and that 's how they got can seem around it whereas if we don 't put it in the district plan that won 't Trump these standards so do we make it like a non-complying activity if it doesn 't make the design students no it is not mentioned put a subdivision and they build a road that doesn 't comply with this we can just simply say well we 're not taking that road over as a council road and well this is this is pretty clear so if a developer wants to build a road they 'll know that if they need you that if they want to be Stern foundation play with us and just the final question for me is I 'm on the transport corridor particular railways one thing that I 've noticed is a collects a huge amount of butter is there any requirement that we can put on here around the general state of how it should be kept it 's now that 's not in it it was up to the private model a note of which is Q around us this is to maintain their what is that history with regards to getting roads but the developers developed its handed back to Council what 's the history because we 've got what I won 't mention in our area some time ago that was taken back by counsel it was turning back to developers and saying sorry that 's actually it wasn 't even built to their standards that 's it 's your problem I 'm not sure about the history of that but we do we do have the legal ability to do that we can also require that there 's some funding arrangement that if we take it over they they must also give us funding to fix it up if they not prepared about themselves because i 'ma give you the two Christmas one you kind of see me at said as if we choose not to take it over what is the issue then because we 've got a deficient subdivisions deficient roads which we don 't attach and what is the if the developer walks away what happens then and secondly do do that does the money that we get from the developer more than k2 would more than cater for the deficiencies I mean as there a calculation dear it would be a negotiation on a case-by-case basis so so we would see how to fish in the rotors and would work out how that would be discussed with the developer ever development sort of it goes belly up and falls over through the funding then of them in that development well will not be able to go ahead and we just end up with a vacant piece of land which in some places they may be pressure for us to take it over by the by the residents in the area and it 's just something we have to deal with that there 's yeah so sorry but what stage do we start working with the developer and would identify that issue we 've got no matter the council we 've got to be very careful with the funds so we 've got to really pre-inked any issues the idea is that we 're building city of the future these were these plans are for this more of an operational that we should so i can write you happy to have that discussion offline so just rather than calling it a transport zone it 's it so it sort of like the previous road in round pedestrian the ex are combined into the those cycleways isn 't on there that it 's really it 's really pulling together what was in the previous plan is what you should have received and your transcript chapter is the most of it is as light grey and that 's what went through and stage one and the tool and it 's only whereas in your leg but then one and it 's only where it 's in black yep those are the changes that you 've never been sorting stage two with it and that 's how the notification will appear as well so that people understand that what 's grayed out what 's light gray they can see the context of what 's coming and stage two but you can 't put a submission on it because it 's already been awesome Jim 's for anyone no I 'm taking it so I 'll move there in fact drive a seconder I 'm sick injured pool all those in favor say aye aye opposed carried lunchtime so I will see from there _"

    "text": "now moving on to the general rules and procedures chapter I had with me Allison mcglochlin and I think Ivan 's turning up to the speak to the signs aspect of that chapter Marie please go well for noise so as you know there 's a number of different subsections for general rules and procedures so there 's been a few changes since the last draft is presented at the the workshop I 'm so the subsections of those concern are temporary activities waterway setbacks noise and signage so to start but just content items so you go so temporal activities based on further discussions made a very small modification to the rule for construction related temporary buildings so in the in the draft that you saw previously those were allowed up to 50 meter squared for the duration of the project in the central city business and mixed-use and industrial areas the issue is raised that the primary reason for having those controls were around the amenity effects in industrial areas that 's that 's not as much of a concern so I 've at an exemption in areas long as the buildings are set have the normal building setbacks we wouldn 't restrict the amount of area but those temporary construction buildings could and what could have and then remember a couple small changes as well to the waterway setback rules one was around the rural fencing rules what we had in the previous draft where fences were built across waterways would have potentially required consent but we 've walked that back to if it 's only twenty percent solid structure then it wouldn 't I 'm so this would be more enabling in recognition of the different types of fencing that when we find in rural versus City environments and there 's been a small changes well to the assessment matters they 've been selected based on the different types of waterways and the different what I 've done is have another look at the public access matters of discretion and added them in the rural environment for some of the higher-order waterways to the downstream upstream and the larger lakes absence of the changes for temper activities and waterway setbacks I think Ivan can introduce some handout here which I just got summary to pass around gives me a slight a very minor remember but i think our members need to be aware of it is that reflected and what 's up here no clear is going to need to just have it i 'll explain what this is about shortly when you get your papers perhaps just before the starting point for this is the previous council briefing where it was pointed out to councillors that neither the plan change 84 nor the proposed replacement plan to that stage here provisions for signage on the airport so the changes that we 're coming to you with today are to do with that issue that it proposes to insert some provisions for signage on the special purpose airport zone so the the sly Tamim at the handout which have given you really relates to the rule where it 's on the on the first page where it 's whether the airport is highlighted it refers to an internal road that 's the only change it 's so what we 're talking about with this particular set the airport site so what 's happened the tables been slightly reformat it because it sort of distinguishes it from those other above those other activities and the specific purpose owns and just while I 'm on that particular table landfill that you just crossed it out that 's a relative is a very minor amendment we won 't be having a landfill specific purpose zone that 's actually being chain cell bill would landfill site that 's going to be an open space and as I think you probably know by now okay so I mean with what though with that slight amendment and the amendments in front you know that have come through I 'm happy to recommend the the sets of provision for the airport and the section 32 as per the resolutions on the understanding that as Brigitte said before we haven 't had a chance to consult with the airport so we would expect the important to come back to us but clearly there has been had that time and certainly we haven 't really had we haven 't had time to do some proper caveats I 'm sort of more than happy to recommend to you that this goes off to the minister they will and the minister may well come back with comments and the important jus course may well as well so but this is our best professional shot at this given the time we 've had what it really does it introduces two sets of controls one just the areas we can have on the airport a specific Airport zone so that is the total maximum area per site that 's 18 square meters or five percent of the internal road frontage and then then the rest of the rules really outside it well they 're basically dealing with billboards along the outer perimeter of the airport and long rusli road Jon Jon 's Romo claims Island Road and pound road so that 's where the concerns were that were raised at our previous briefing so we 've limited to three sites around that perimeter so that 's under 3 i 'll just take you quickly through them the first one then 18 square meters that 's the limit of the the airport the content is to Hester has to relate solely to activities within specific purpose zone that should be not specific specific and six at least they are permitted by 6 8 3 1 which are permitted activities so any then we go on to billboards so to air speaks to this there are going to be 10 meters back from the boundary with memorial avenue so we sit gotta sit back there from the signs of on memorial avenue bearing in mind this is still part of the airport so we 're memorial avenue goes from us lee road up to the roundabout it is still an airport environment but we 're doing at best to try and retain that gateway that 's that was raised before and no more than three signs excluding temporary signs along that those boundaries roads with Rusli jones Maclean 's chips at Jessops impound so they 're quite that 's quite restrictive but i think it 's looking at what there is now that is i don 't think it 's unrealistic but the airport may come back and have a different sit back at least 8 meters from any adjoining his own boundary and i think there is a that maybe rural zone there that that rule could be read under that just needs to but the sudden there really is a safe as a safety net signs relating to it any activity must be on the same site so in other words what this is trying to do is stop a particular company on the airport advertising and on Russell erode for example they 've got to have the sign the sign as restrictive do on the same site under where the activity is that yep that 's going Peter leeming drive yes what sort of signage next to mcdonalds what sort of signage will get have really well that would be limited to up to 18 square metres but it won 't be allowed to advertise along brussels erode johns road or around the primitive primitive the airport so ever non site advertisement on site side only if you anything would add the oven or you want to get with gems I 'm not nothing before two aired we heavy to take questions any questions yeah bones that are cropping up everywhere but very much a really good example having a real adverse impact on our natural landscapes and amenity pour it well a negative impact on visibility and so what can you just tell me like what of what we 've got to protect against the proliferation as we see in the last district where all those outdoor advertising signs I mean I know that to get consents but they always been consumed and it seems very seldom that we ever say no okay well there are there to pass this issue counselor one on the airport site itself via port as an airport so we 've tried to limit the amount of restriction on the important fact we 've put in that area limit which is an extra restriction which is currently not in the plan that won 't stop the proliferation so much but being an airport we our viewers that signage is if it 's contained within the internal parts of the operations of the airport it 's probably not going to really matter too around the edge of the airport we 've quite strict limits on that visual amenity n traffic safety so under this particular rule I don 't think there could be any more signs around pound row because there 's already one there and they couldn 't be any more along rusty or johns road now I think they put may have some difficulty with that but we 've been that they have quite restrictive and that 's where in our view the the visual amenity has the most impact as we on the outside of the airport where it interfaces with the rural area and along the main highway around Russell erode johns road so that 's where the emphasis of the rules aligned they 're up there lying on the edge of the airport and the interface with the surrounding environment not eternally you but they just put these big outdoor signs up it just detracts from the whole and military so I mean did a citywide but there 's also the airport you know those big outdoor advertising signs on the earth years on the airport site itself think of one with a roundabout is for example we haven 't apart from that area limit which is 18 square meters which is not very bad i mean 18 it is almost the size of a house up high and 33 meters why but you wouldn 't get there to be probably more of a fall before something like that it 's probably wouldn 't be out of place on the airport site not done and i think we need to leave it to the airport company a little bit to see how it may affect the design of the terminal or that kind of thing i 'm not sure whether we want to go too far down that track in managing strictly the visual effects within the airport site itself around the car parks and around the terminal eyelet we 've really steered away from that I mean I maybe I just I 'm a minority of you I think on this people don 't care people just happy um what about the rest of the city then well you know because I don 't you know we last time we came back to with an answer on that question around visual pollution I think we recall where will I think there are two things so I 've only really came here prepared to put the amendments to the material that you 've received and in the mail recently all right we at a point we can move these recommendations this is sunny for signs now we still have the rest of the tribes in operational yet you know there are specific recommendations on signs and Alice you not do not have a recommendation honestly yes we do the whole thing there within the whole gamut of chapter so pets it 's best that we pause there through the rest of it many how many recommendations Arlene do you have just um no you 're to possess RPG we got 24 signs so we 've got one which is the moving the amendments and in a and the other one is for section 32 but they 'll come up at the end okay or I wore them more run-through identities no more questions and move on to the _''_814.41 notified of what the changes are so when do you actually let them know I think we 're talking about two things there the decision on the spares is coming to you on the 26 of this month through the full council because that 's going through the normal rema process okay sorry yep Georgia box on 3 + S&H was a little annoying um I 'm refill uska lund policy languages playing in it and so the noise provisions the noise rules we have had heavy technical input into i 'm reviewing these noise rules and they were found to be reasonable so as a result the overall approach was to of the review is one of updating and fine-tuning the rules I 'm not over complete complete rewriting the challenge here was to get all the rules from where they were sitting in different chapters into just this one general rule chapter and so um as a since i since you 've seen the the draft chapter last month um nothing much has changed I mean the key changes are still there but then the difference with this the formatting I 'm the steps on how to use the rules were amended I 'm just to read better was admittedly it was a bit confusing then there was a permitted provision about the wind turbines and we 've deleted that rule because it 's covered already in the chapter 11 utilities and then I 'm and also just a rearranging of some of the rules where would sit like them in the location specific noise standards we have removed the Headlee part a Victoria Park a Victoria Square and Cathedral Square from this table because it will now sit with the Central City chapter the Rope corner Motorsport Park used to be in the region town last month version was as an exception we 've now put it in as one of the location specific sites and the aircraft noise as well the standards will be in the specific activities other than that the proposed amendments will be fall under the general blanket amendments just for a numbering and formatting yep just just for the noise thanks I so in terms of the recommendations for the resolution there one is around the referencing numbers for scheduled activities can be sorry can we scroll just yes keep going up that 's for guy keep going keep going after there it 's like one minute and the first one is around correcting referencing numbers on the maps for scheduled activities the second one is for the section 32 report on the water body setbacks there 's a few appendices that need to be added so I 've distributed those during the break and this is basically just a schedule listing the changes to the waterways I 'm so these are segments of waterways that have been added as a result of the review lakes and ponds which other setbacks for the first time and the waterways on banks peninsula and the next part of the appendix is a set of maps that show you the difference between the operative plan and the proposed plan in terms of the waterways so you can see on here where sections of waterways have been added or removed as a result of the review so sorry Alice Thomas was what you 're saying is this is yeah so there 's no overall recommendation there that covers this it 's um be at appendix 7.7 so coat it does include detective you can do seven point seven point one should there be a one on me it 's a whole pendek 7.7 okay thank you so it 's to add the schedule appendix 7.7 at appendix 7.8 which is the explanation of the process for classifying water bodies on banks peninsula and as part of that appendix also the maps would show the differences the next recommendation there 's a small error on the plan maps around the waimakariri river which should be identified as a downstream water way as it is in the operative plan ivan head two recommendations for signage so one was to add the provisions for signage in the special purpose airport zone 2 Section six point eight point four point eight of the chapter and make consequential amendments to the layout of the table and also to insert the attached material for the sign of subsection of the section 32 report and the last recommendation is to amend the draft which was distributed but it was put in the section 32 report instead of the chapter I 'm so just moving that from one thing that you can provide it into another there 's a little bit of duplication between this list and what 's actually in giving the specific details but that 's okay if you just scroll down again please yes so stop debt up oh no right just one screen down no oh sorry does it stop for exit and again it doesn 't matter all I 'm trying to show you is that that last list of recommendations as repeating what 's actually in detail in the first few pages of the recommendation so it 's it 's not new the Detailers and your package here that you had in front of you big sorry is it is see if i could just just just one sentence on what were the changes will be fine oh okay so you 're just shifting them around the the landscaping entry rules yeah they were they were mistakenly put into the section 32 report and I can set it into the other is in the chapter itself do you want any other questions on on the stuff on chip so this is SSL of alcohol page sorry i don 't have page numbers to the 6.9 restricted discretionary activities solace product between hours of live inland 7am from any site located within 75 meters of a residential zone and I see you 've excluded the central city makes you sound so obviously they should we have a victoria street is the proximity of the bars close to a residential neighborhood and really what it shows is that actually our rules aren 't tough enough I mean it 's very easy target to see um it 's been excluded here because that goes into the central city chapter so I believe the intention for the centrist many chapters as a standalone chapter and that chapter as I said before we 'll be coming to you but it is delayed so is it yeah i mean the frustration that 's all the buzzer appointed concerns now that 's right but that is not a matter that we can deal with in the central city chapter as a standalone chapter it has in a sense it 's like a money district plan within a district plan and that 's because it relates to the central city recovery plan so all of these issues is what you need to raise our chapter so if we chose to do anything in the central city so we don 't have a single role when I just a planned it relates to the central city now well we well yes that that whole chapter deals with all of the central study rules none of these chapters that are going through today deal with the central city because the central city chapter has rules specifically pertaining to that area only council roles and and Sarah rose token but there must be things in a district plan that affect the central city that aren 't specific to the central city but I kind of general across know everything that will affect the central city including all of these general rules and procedures are in the central city chapter it 's a standalone chapter will be a section of is it any reason why we can 't do this now yes because it 's not it 's not actually in this chapter what you 're asking for comes through to you on the Central City chapter and no we can 't_''_1377.18 do the Central City chapter because you haven 't seen it need look I don 't know if this applies here in terms of sines and sale of alcohol but for some signs and I will be familiar with the one long since your aerobic adultery stop sign was actually be out selling booze and so is there a way of actually like here I guess ensuring that sign signs around alcohol Eric appropriate you know the one I mean Ivan yeah that 's on that 's on the roadside as there 's no jobs here yeah I think that 's more of a by Laura shoot counselor think I don 't_''_1413.42 this on the five public land I 'll never be on it 'll be on it won 't be on other do nothing I 'm not sure the one I 'm sure that when you mean the quick liquor for the club well it 's the block of shop Talk the clause law is on our William a feel yeah yeah it 's a very professionally run prada store yes just a bit that that 's just a minute of the sauna thing full I 'd have to go and have a look haha well I can 't actually picture it he 's got some tense officials yeah that they 're covered though well if they in a commercial zone which they would be they will be covered by these signs sign provisions which applied for commercial zone as far as content goes yeah that 's always been an issue I don 't know who can really comment on that without so they 're having we 'll think about that all right but we don 't really get there are content issues around it 's more of a Content issue on that yes yeah I don 't you mean absolutely uh-huh carried yeah thank you damn fools _"

    "text": "running slightly behind but hopefully we can make up the time and we 're taking lunch at twelve-thirty 21 strictly at twelve-thirty what 's that yep chapter 16 industrial right just going to talk you through as very quickly the changes from the workshop version that you saw previously some of it I 've touched on already namely the interface with schools and open spaces and the deletion of rules which are part of phase 1 i 'm just going to focus on area specific provisions that are in the version before you this relates to land off springs road the land north of wacky Road and the male site there 's been a review a review of the rules from a legal perspective but also there 's been a review of those rules against the statement of expectations we 've needed to consider what are we doing to be more enabling and to reduce consents now as an outcome of that review we 've identified that rather than what the phase one chapter reads as at present which is that you have the general rules and then you 've there 's repetition of every activity table for the whole chapter we 're changing the format and so that 's why the format of the rules before you looks different to what you saw in the workshop as avoiding the repetition of every activity table and relying on one at the start so it 's not a change of substance that 's really a format change in terms of the studying with springs road which is the land west of Springs Road and to the north of the proposed southern motorway there 's proposed to be from the version you saw last we 're amending a rule which related to there not being any use of the setback for outdoor storage and rather than applying that approach we 're proposing that this rule which requires screening of any screening by Wade landscaping or buildings to manage that interface as opposed to saying simply no to any any use of that setback for storage why are heroes which is the land north of wire rocky road and going up to here wood road it 's a land between nun wat park the tape campus the same zoning is take campus for that matter there 's some changes proposed and the nature of these changes is to consolidate the rules and avoid us having another set of site-specific rules in the plan the problem with had in recent years is every plan changes introduced new site specific rules and you end up with a much bigger document which is more complex and difficult to use and havin regards to the statement of expectations we need to make it easier to use and to apply it 's not just about making it easier to use but also taking a consistent approach for the chapter so where there 's a setback from a residential zone boundary that setback shouldn 't differ for every individual area that we identify as a sub zone so it 's really applying that consistent approach so i 'll just talk you through those quickly there 's a special height limit for this block sites within 50 meters of ward road and Stanley 's road we proposed initially a height limit of 11 meters but we 're proposing a blanket what would be allowed beyond 50 meters in the previous version anyway the second change is in respect of the road setback the previous version you saw required a twin he meets a setback from Ward road and Stanley 's rose we 're proposing to apply a generic approach as is in phase one which is that that setbacks reduced to six meters that sounds significant burps is a need to be consistent in our approach and through rules on-site coverage and landscaping we can store achieve a park-like environment as anticipated for that zone I 'm now going to talk about mail and before it talk about mail do you have any questions at to that point we 'll go turn in yani with regards to changing the setback from 20 meters to going back to 6 meters that significant to remember why we wanted the 20 meters hmm so the 20 meters came about the tape campus which is already zoned and under development the 20 meters setback applied on the frontage of wardrobe and Stanley 's rows so that buildings will well sit back and so it now the general rules that apply to the industrial park zone has introduced in phase one I only proposed a 6-meter sit back and that similar zoning the question then is what justifies that much greater setback in this location as opposed to any other location and to be honest that the argument is weak in that respect because the outcome for the for that for that specific area relative to another industrial park zone is the same we still want an open environment with landscaping but that 's to be achieved by site coverage rules which limits the maximum coverage of any sites or fifty fifty percent and also requires that twenty percent of the sizes landscapes so there 's different ways of achieving the same outcome it doesn 't require that significant setback and a 20-metre setback to be honest would result in potentially the unofficial user land notwithstanding the site coverage limit of fifty percent so yeah cool so psycho a long rusty road would be really good and also just if you could just comment on what those teas for intersection improvements are they traffic lights and there 's a rule which requires that the signals at the intersection of watered road and here would road and that the intersection of stanley 's road and he would rotors limited to left and left out let 's to manage traffic flows and to address it 's about managing the effects of what 's proposed in that area identified for rezoning but I 'm all aware there 's currently issues among wardrobe which would be also addressed in part through signals I just like their an integrated traffic assessment that looks at this kind of wider area yeah so as part of to inform the rules we had consultants prepare a transport assessment to evaluate the effects not just of the Syria but also to look at other development that 's planned through the lane use recovery plan or identified through the lane ish recovery place I 'm still struggling to understand there may be on the only the world that if you just keep adding traffic lights to your traffic system you make it really any fashion yeah one of the one of the reasons why we space which is laying off of why my career eros which is a old gravel pit was that the pressure from that area which is north of the Syria would effectively require some upgrade and potentially signals which would be additional to these ones and that 's going to impede obviously traffic flows relative to one set of signals so it 's about managing that traffic environment and not eroding the function of here Wood Road which will continue to be a main collective road for the city right and so can we put a sock away in a long rusty road like Curro cycleway kind of plan I know we 've got a cycleway coming somewhere and here but I don 't see where it 's connected the the upgrade of rusty rotors plans is so has been subject to a notice of requirement so effectively an application by NZTA it 's a designate and along that section to support the widening and to limit access to wear a few road to lift them left out that 's notice of requirements recommendations been made back to nzta and it so I need to look at NZT as plans and whether there 's any provision for cycle waves along there I know that there 's a thing again sorry but I know you entertained they 're not keen but when we got a whole area that 's going to get developed we should be requiring cycleways it should be just part of with we are investing and major cycle ways and we actually need them to actually you know we encourage stormwater I 'd mentally as without transport network clean but is it no yes the claim that the notice of requirement is a separate separate matter to us in potentially David Faulkner who 's coming to speak with you on the transport chapter might be in a bit illogical yeah we 've been asked to approve and outline development plan yes right so if you want to put cycleways on as part of the hour I development point in you have to do it now the problem is that the notice of requirement is ahead of that outline development plan the what what we can require on rusty roads rules so there 's not a lawyer but legal advice indicates that you can 't impose requirements which are beyond the control of the developer so the upgrades I talked about of the intersection is on here wood road they 're not requiring the developer to put those changes in its effectively the rules halt developments at a certain point before those upgrades occur similarly we couldn 't require a cycleway developer to provide a cycleway on roughly road you could require that you could limit scale of developments in the zone until recycle waste put on recipe road but then NZTA would hold the controller would have control of whether that 's appropriate or not and and I think that you know our process is overtaken things and if there 's no cycleway planned then the opportunity is closed to a degree on that it doesn 't preclude though future cycle provision along watered rodle Stanley 's Road which to be honest maybe a far more conducive environment for cyclists than riding along a state highway it 's kind of my point if you look at where the school cycling you know that always heavy traffic going on and extra traffic so requiring the developer who is going to make huge profits from rezoning this land to provide a cycleway I actually think is really sensible like I just cannot believe that we continuously allow these developers to maximize their profits at the expense of local community and local community and the things that we want to do is a city if we really want to support cycling we can 't just spend all the money ourselves and all our new developments not to be as cycle friendly as possible like it what 's not legally possible is to require works that are beyond the control of the landowner so what a way to address it would be that you either you put a limit on developments until there 's a cycleway in place which then the developer can only proceed so far with their subdivision before that cycleways put in place and that requires council to take a role in leading the development of that cycle way and obtaining monies from developers to fund that the other way until there 's a cycleway in place is to require that there 's a development so that you require that is a cycleway running through their land the difficulty of that approach is that unlike other areas like Preston 's and other greenfield areas the series got 14 different landowners and as made up of lifestyle blocks and is unlikely to be every one of those landowners I know for a fact won 't proceed with development at the same time and see in order to achieve a cycle way through their land you 'd have to require section to be developed as and when developer as in when the landowner or a developer comes along proceeds with the subdivision so you 'd potentially end up with a cycle weights nowhere and the connecting pieces put them later other than vehicle access yes the same time as they put a good vehicle access I could do we could and we could introduce a rule to require a cycleway as part of the road network further time better sure I just raised this obviously relevant to a road as much as subject to the discussion we can address that I think that would be fine from what yani tseng it 's probably not a Christian for here but it is a question with regards to when we 're looking at our roads and writing metrics and building erodes surely is just a standard it must include a cycle lane because they 're just kinda it 's almost like it 's until Vicky mentioned it it 's a sit pretty sure and it should fit if we 're going to build a road it has to include a cycle lane I mean so there 's no question well it should have to include a size they should have to got at the moment to sit pretty sure which it shouldn 't be yes absolutely yeah the issue here though is that cycle way has to follow what design standards I mean our cycle waves across the city depending on where they are and on what roads have got varying requirements as far as design standards go so how are you going to apply that I mean this is a mess of piece it well it is you 've got to work out what the rules are I mean how big is the road and what will that work triggers trigger as far as what 's required for design standards I don 't want people just painting white lines and there 's this cycle way and then took the box in theory where we can what we should do is separate the cycle like physical from the road so they 've got to build a road alongside the road they actually have to build a so quite simple change of land and they 've got to put a road through it anyway if we don 't start putting cycle ways through overall development plans we 're just going to hold back out of government of cycleways for a long time how might we can 't_''_899.099 do this all day long I have to do this they had to do a road anyway so I 'm not sure what sort of our game and it will be a local road this is a subject for the subdivision development chapter not for this particular chapter has 44 when and where various footpaths go and cycleways go in and what have you you don 't want to cycle way down every single Road that 's being put into the city so we 've got that it 's chapter 8 that 's coming up up that 's correct so we have the relevant people that can speak to speak to him so we 'll park there and revisit there after lunch right oh just what I 've got left is male and then I 'm closed BM the male provisions where we 've revisited and looked at how they achieved the state how they first in the context of the statement of expectations and have sought to rebalance the scales for want of a better term I 'm just going to focus on haight setbacks and landscaping and rules that differ from the last version you saw I 'll start with hyatt we 're retaining the height limit you saw previously of 12 meters for buildings within 50 meters of memorial avenue beyond that 50 meters the previous version allowed guest accommodation to go up to 20 maximum limit for height in that area was less at 15 meters now there 's a question of what a call permitted baseline and by that i mean if guest accommodation can go to 20 meters what 's the effects of other buildings going to 20 meters and why should they be limited to 15 meters so it 's about consistency and approach now a guest accommodation is limited to a smaller area fronting memorial avenue and rusty road but this in my view no reason to restricts other buildings to a lower height limit relative to guest accommodation and so what 's proposed relative to the last version is that the height limits increased to 20 meters across the zone with the exception of that lower haight whilst retaining the lower height limit of 12 metres within 15 meters of memorial avenue in terms of setbacks and landscaping for those that know the site there 's a boundary that the zone has with the Commodore hotel and in the previous version put to you the setback required from that boundary was 20 meters which is quite significant bearing in rules for that zone proposal phase 2 only require six meters setback so there 's some degree of inequity of here granted the height limit in the Commodore hotel site is 11 meters and the height limit on the male side is greater 20 meters but what I 'm putting forward to is for the eastern boundary that the 20 meter height 20 meter setbacks reduced significantly down to 6 meters which is the same as applies to the Commodore hotel from their boundary now in terms of the increased height limit that the male site has of 20 across their zone the effects of that 20 meter height limit on the joining Commodore site would be limited by recession plain rules so we 've got a requirement that no building true penetrates for a 45 degree angle from 2.3 meters above the boundaries so you 're not going to end up with a 20 metre tall building 6 meters from the boundary in fact you 'd need to be setbacks 17 meters from the boundary at least to achieve 20 meters while still being within the recession plan so mail or second Ivan hid road the setback in the previous version we propose was 15 metres and we 're proposing to reduce that to 6 meters the basis of reducing that setback to 6 meter is for consistency with other industrial park zones where the the provision is for six meters Road step back from 4-6 meters to take from road boundaries where its opposite residential and it 's really about consistency in that respect the final interface I just want to touch on is residential activity within the zone so within the male site which we 're designing to industrial there 's two residential properties at present neighborhood which are owned by the proponents of the male plan change both have houses set well back from the boundaries and previous in the previous version of setback at 20 meters was required for any development within the male site from those residential properties within the male side we 're proposing to rather than relying on step back and landscaping rules simply opposing a recession plan requirements so that buildings can be much closer but there 's still a recession I talked about of needing to be at least 17 meters from the boundary to achieve 20 meters would apply and for that matter even if it were three meters from the boundary the maximum height would be five point four meters so I 've spoken about three different boundaries aven head road the eastern boundary and residential sites with them and we 're proposing a more permissive regime by way of these changes which are welcome your feedback on the same applies to landscaping where we 're reducing our landscaping requirements from those same interfaces relative to what you saw before and that 's to acknowledge matters of to acknowledge that we need to be consistent with other rules that apply to other zones of a similar nature but also to be recognized that we need to rebalance the scales just got a few questions with regards to memorial a vignette proposing the set victory six meters oh sorry from memorial avenue we 're retaining the 20-metre setback basically the kisses from the copthorne hotel boundary to the side so that then the other question is between that the 20 meters and you 're looking at solely for height but what about noise because it is noise would be controlled by noise standards and chapter 6 which Ellison 's can speak to you about surely we see a lot though of incidents in Christchurch and we 've got some issues and I wish me and with regards to bit and also I 'm odors and odors that incredibly hard to deal with and it 's almost after the fit so I was presuming that the 20-metre sit back between the hotel and thus industrial era was to cover more than just a height restriction it wasn 't intended to for the purpose of nuisance it was more about this scale although in hindsight that seems excessive that 20 meter setback and there 's other controls on the plan to manage the nuisance effects of noise odor is a matter that would be subject to control for the regional councils rules right because resides here it 's after so it sounds like any other things that aren 't around a built form that are in our jurisdiction anyway are under purely ramp building the structure apart from owner because there doesn 't get a say there 's nothing to do with us alright any questions drives will comfortably move to the recommendations just before we do and answers of the recommendation I should briefly talk you through it can you move down can you scroll it down thank you there 's a further area north of wacky Road it 's a case of reinstating rules which relates to the boundary with the rural-urban friend zone and the school here would school so that we still have a setback in landscaping requirement and so that 's what the first part of the recommendation is the second part relates to if you can scroll down the Sigma part relates to the memorial news the mail so we 've just been talking about and there 's a rule which requires spent intent of the rule was to require there 's a fence and landscaping along the boundary between an internal road and rusty rose and the purpose of that rule was to avoid vehicles within the male site driving along and their lights to be reworded to address that so this is really just reflecting what was intended but better wording so that 's the extent of that change and the third part is about the coastal environment which is quite different obviously there 's further coastal chat coastal environment chapter and other chapters where those zones are within the coastal or near the coastal environment is a need for assessment matters to acknowledge the effects of development on that on the character but also access so that was reinstating what should have been in there and that was in the private previous vision you saw so that 's that 's the extent of what I wanted to raise with you okay great get one question from time I 'm still concerned with regards to a going from a 6-meter sit back to it from from a 20-metre to a 6-meter between the existing hotel and an industrial area that 's being proposed and I know that we have rules but we I mean I 've seen in our community that it 's like we 've got the rules but attacks a while on and on and on so I 'm concerned that we 've got an established business we do need development but I thought the 20-metre was for a protection for the existing industry or the existing hotel and um I 'm still concerned so I guess what the question is there in a valid one could understand precedent around the six metre seatback that the copthorne has and if you had another copthorne to there you could mirror that and have sex movies on that side given that this is light industrial so different years notwithstanding the fact there may be a hotel within the male side as well but given this light and light industrial zone why did we do the same as the cop thorns rules as sorry I should have pointed out assistance e with the general rules that were posed on phase one for the industrial park zone so so it 's consistent with industrial parks anywhere it 's six meters yeah so the other locations that there 's an industrial park designer the land north of wacky Road and then land of Wilma 's road accepted the memorial Ava 's us is special because it 's it 's the Gateway to Christ so we 've allowed for a 20-metre dia and so that 's an exception to the rule so this is a site that has had been going for some time so I 'm just wondering we 've made an exception here why not look look at the X oh that was in the previous version put to you on the workshop and that 's in hindsight seems successive relative to the effects all right um Paul and in yani ever say shooter 's been just yelling I 'm or really have been able Moria leg all right yeah but remember though this is the boundary from copthorne to the site it 's not memorial a of no to the end and structures in the mouth site just to make you aware it 's also dealing with the boundary with a van head road and the boundary with residential properties within the zone so just bear that in mind too and all what would it be fair to say that I couldn 't imagine notice it from a from a resident or a observers point of view it 's that that 's something that 's it 's not really happening directly in your line of sight the relationship will the restrictions around how close it can be to the adjoining property there the affected parties and thus respects are going to be op the Commodore so the copthorne where isn 't residence on the opposite side of a van head road because we 're dealing with the setback from maven head road as well and the residents within the zone of being two households yep so with regards to a believe road there 's a number of properties on the on the south side of a van head road if you 've got a 6-meter sit back with the 20-metre building what are their loss of amenities with grads because obviously the sun 's on the north side so what is the the modeling with regards to their loss of value the the potential is is for some Sun lights to potentially not but sunlight to be blocked to an extent one option to that road boundary so that you 've got a 45 degree angle running from the road boundary up into the mail site which buildings can 't penetrate which would mean 20 metres build and could only be achieved at least 17 metres from the boundary with a van head road however a few into 15 meters this big as was originally proposed those buildings could actually be a lot closer let 's still have to if you have no recession plane requirement then yes yeah but if you still got that 45 degree 20 meters as it 's 17 meters 15 meters old a median would be a lot closer history yeah the previous version we put to you of 15 meter height limit had a setback from even hid road of 15 meters has it been any feedback from the properties a note on the south side of a van hit road with regards to the change of this proposal that made submissions on the plan change and a concerned about the effects on that interface and was those based on the 15 meter height or the 20 meter proposed a bill with me a moment proposed to 15 meter height limits with a setback from a venir out of 15 meters so right though so just to take that to its logical conclusion they haven 't hit the community are concerned about even the previous version I put to you but they are not aware of the change that proposed change it to 20 meters but it 's not at the moment although after oh so they so they they did have a problem with 20 meters producing at you so it 's kind of a conundrum isn 't it because yeah but remember this this is this is professional planning advice not political and tuition on how you know what we think will get risen and riled actually it 's a bad that 's sorry sorry I personally is this we just oh not saying it doesn 't excuse can I just what my question was meaning we 've gone out for consultation and feedback from the public for the 20-metre for a 15 min height we 're now looking at a 20 meter height but those you know since we 've truncated the time frame for these chapters there has been no public consultation on this matter but we will be post the second of March going out there and ensuring that the people are aware of what 's in these chapters so that they will put submissions and if they 're concerned the feedback I spoke about it was expressed on submissions on the private line change request oh it was okay okay no it makes it clear its consistency with the approach taken to other industrial zones and the general rule and phase one to the industrial park zone of a 6-meter setback from Rhode boundaries so I guess what I 'm hearing from the committee round here is totally understand Preston and consistency with other industrial areas but I guess what I 'm taking is and I agree that this isn 't just any old industrial English my Mary 's you know and some no no no that the reality is you know that is the gateway to the city so we 're obviously and very close to UM residential you and gateway I 'm here hearing what you 're saying they 're so sort pologize too jaani as well I gave to my second quest for Annie had his hand up so lucky last Christian from yonni um I 'm just this is specifically around Memorial I don 't take any discussion about the impact on the center of listening and I would have thought this quite a key consideration like you know allowing development to happen intense development for happen away from the central city actually chilly things like hotels etc has an adverse impact so the any assessment has been done about what this does for the same central city and you might recall the two articles in the paper this week from inner-city people that can 't find tenants and you know are feeling obviously very frustrated we and the assistant who haven 't commented on every rule that 's in the proposal in terms of managing those impacts on the citrus city with limited office activity to five thousand square meters and in fact retail activity is limited to an ancillary function and so it has to be office other key ones we 've got quite tight controls on those to avoid impacts on the central city and that gives support to what sort and the central city recovered crisis center will recover recovery plan and just stayed all so that no doubt and the section 32 for the commercial chapter there would be quite a bit of discussion about keeping the central city as the primary so like a show with like the elements so no was next door how many would that be about five thousand square meters or I 'm just trying to understand the kind of context of what five thousand square meters is of epic would it be it 's I can to deserve the office development on lincoln road hitting south on the right hand side that was built post-earthquake but the media whoo yeah yeah yeahs from memory that 's three to four sorry three four thousand square meters oh I couldn 't tell you though are you you 're talking GL if I so the gross leasable floor area I 'll need to confirm let me figure I gave you to think of something to but yeah it 's it 's right it 's a reasonable amount yeah faisal doing that be about 5,000 and the title of show place is in the order of 25,000 and then and then just the I had a question around the brownfields sides just on page five sorry there 's no coach number on it but you 've got the proposal I was just trying to get my head around you 've talked about phase 1 and phase 2 and the resigning yeah so the ones that say proposal razon and phase one I presume that 's already happened so we just disregard they 're the ones that we should be interested in our phase two which is railway layer between Wilson 's road south and angels Road proposals resign and phase 2 to transport zone but is there a map of weirdos zones are and what transport rules that will become it that 's worth years part of the phase two package of rules so the transport design provision and supply and is because it 's still row it Rayland understand does aware of essentially when undertook an exercise 20 and five potential sites like those listed here where residential development could be enabled by rezoning and there 's very few large brownfield sites out there despite previous work undertaken what we have done those included a policy in phase one so any proposal that comes forward for a site that we haven 't identified at the current time that proposal will be considered against the policy and more favorable terms than what would have always be the case right um we at the point now we could move those resolutions and there 's nothing more aired no more questions three with memorial air that 's a going about height no idea no no just hot ok 0 stuff coming on it is it defendable as if 15 meters finest the question the statement of expectations as always you know in our minds it 's it will be will need to consider the reasons for justifying a different height limit for buildings that aren 't guest accommodation taking a more restrictive approach to buildings for office use for instance and applying 15 for guest accommodation big squishin what 's what 's distinguishable I think we could still argue that the geese tachometers to accommodation is limited to the frontage of Memorial sorry limited to a defined area on the ODP which is generally the northeast corner so we could argue that hot a lower height limit of 15 meters is to manage to fix on the surrounding interfaces to the south and to the east yeah okay is it saying that people are wanting you know I as I said you know I 'm in your hands with us i can see pros and cons either way you 've heard the explanation from staff should we such a little like that changed to 15 well in terms of the recommendation we could there 's a section further down about the moro avenue site we could add a rule there to save time we could just put a point apply 50 meter height limit to to the full extent of the zone except excluding the hotel excluding the area within 15 meters 11 50 meters of memorial avenue is this an ok wave you say ok way it 's your decision about what you put in the plan at this stage when it comes to writing evidence whether or not it can be fully supported on the basis of what comes back from the minister 's comments as another story well it 's not particularly worried about you there 's no point as putting in things that um that you can 't defend there 's no it 's just I totally understand it but the fact of the matter is this is such an important gateway to our city yeah because he 's so cute with what we develop so I would like to go the fifth I 'll go with you know yeah it all in all honesty with us this goes without saying but you know I yeah I I 'd be sharing it view whether it be there whether it 's in the phenyl my reward or not actually makes no difference it is a key area but um okay the only thing that sort of worries me a bit around that there 's the implications that may then have mean that it 's going to then have office space proliferated more around the the sign you can use squashing it down really yeah that has an effect though what that you 'll probably going to get your best return from office space as opposed to warehousing sort of stuff so you know with everything like this this is it 's never been more true than the domino effect and planning so you squeeze it down and the flow on our feet as a result there 's probably more office space in this PMP print sort of tight places and they 're subject to how you managed to set bags how wait you want to under the setbacks and landscape and that by reducing the setbacks here providing more capacity for the spread of development five thousand square meters is actually quite a lot though you know like really and I and I do understand that there was that they were saying that this isn 't taking away from the central city sort of stuff but it is going to really a little bit it will the basis of the 'll recall some at length discussions about providing for it and tape and same zoning same environment anticipated and it was acknowledged in that discussion that a high technology environment there 's going to be a greater amount of office this is the same zoning same outcome sort and so the ability to defend a position that gives 5,000 to tape but not to mail but Tate is also an existing heat off us for our technology company that 's been the affair as I can remember but as the Tate campus on the gateway to the city no so no it 's not in the argument before about their height and changes things you go 30 meters and change things again the fact that murderers and it 's a single argument I have is that this is the gateway to our city memorial even you hear no more the seatbacks around the reason fine 6 meters what 's this is the key to our city we 're recovering we need tourism we want to drive it the last thing we want is people get around the roundabout going to want them to see so we 've got to be so careful how we move forward I appreciate the work you 've done but I really am gonna see that were the 15 meters on the basis of cancer scan Duritz coming can we add to the recommendation pleased that the section 32 also be amended to recognize the location of the site being in the part of the Gateway to the city and something to that effect and the war memorial that it 's named after any thoughts in on the five thousand square meters if you bring that down so it doesn 't have a flow-on effect you try and kept that and say three thousand I just think it 's completely different 2 potatoes I like there is no poverty something to bear in mind is that the male plan change is notified and floated that same provision and our submission on the plane change didn 't oppose that no okay like what was the exactly though we 've seen a lot of time on the skies got to a point that we were all delighted with we will there be that 's effectively included and there because that 's now the body of that mm-hmm all right so I 'm sure Tim will be delighted to move that are you happy to signet oh I 've got feel sick you know yet I all those in favor say aye aye opposed carriage thank you _"

    "text": "when you saw the commercial provisions for phase two last the changes reflect a review of the provisions against the statement of expectations the changes also reflect a legal review that 's been undertaken of the provisions so in terms of commercial this is just four points I want to outline in the workshop version if I can call it that we included some rules and guidelines for a Carrara they 're not in the vision going forward legal advice is that the scope to amend what is in phase one is limited and and that we shouldn 't be signal means what 's already subject to submissions so a Curragh is not there a second point well it again reflecting that legal advices phase to the workshop version proposed deletion of some rules which we 've been dealt with by over phase two chapters and again that 's come out because it 's in phase one and we can 't meddle with the substance of what 's in phase one the third point and phase two of the commercial chapter we 're dealing with the interface with phase two open space or school and we have reviewed the suppl it also applies to this applies to commercial and industrial there was proposed to be a reduced height limit within 30 metres of the boundary of open space or a school setbacks and landscaping now we 've undertaken a review review of these standards against what 's in the operative plan and tested against the statement of expectations which signals are clear expectation of reducing consents we 've removed setback and landscaping requirements on the basis the operative plan doesn 't have anything at the presence and gone with a proposed rule which requires screening by way of fencing or landscaping or a wall which effectively should manage the interface effectively and is almost identical to Watson the operative plan the final point on commercial is New Brighton the previous foot the workshop version put to you it included two rules one was about a lower higher threshold for urban design so more development being captured by a design fresh hold and this was discussed in the first phase about suburban sensors that have been subject to master plan is a review at the moment in the context of phase one to look at the appropriateness of those urban design thresholds and we 'll report back in that context but we 've proposed to apply them more general urban design fresh hold which would be any development over 500 square meters as opposed to development over 250 square meters so that captures less development for an for an urban design assessment the other point is there was in the workshop version a rule about non-compliance with reading into activity standards which is was unnecessary on the basis there 's a rule and phase one which deals with that anyway sir that 's commercial do you have any questions on it hopefully this applies not only you know your bride amphitheater well you 've just mentioned you frightened but that design threshold so if we look at that area subject to the master plan if we 're wanting to approach that visa V new Regent Street we want some kind of designs is what you 're saying is that a threshold for that design is now much I so in terms meters would be triggered as opposed to what some phase one which is development over 250 square meters the basis for that change has been a review of the provisions which signals that the plans not is more towards the controlling end on the continuum rather than the enabling end and we need to have a step change in that but we 're reporting bacteria separately on phase one have a fixed phase one but this is more enabling and you see it those encouraging you know ken utley but by increasing that Evan design threshold you 're more enabling and in the case of new brush and I think there 's merits in that approach because you 're facilitating development which and a developer may perceive that if they need to reply for results consent them that might be enough to turn them off going okay so if it 's too tight too controlling then they may be put off redeveloping or putting up a new building in your bra jam and even given the what 's on the ground we need to take it more enabling approach there the commercial ones like you 've just no no um the there 's no further changes from the version that was circulated earlier this week so effectively it 's just a standard resolution that your approval what 's been given to you the resolution that 's on the board counselor okay I just so if we wanted so to have to like that if we wanted the urban design requirements not to be reduced I just I want to move a memo to that effect so what 's the best way of doing that and just move it phase two of the commercial chapter is limited to New Brighton we deferred new consideration in your Brighton all over commercial zones across the city or in phase one so we 're just talking about new brush in here and if you feel that the threshold needs to be altered from what 's before you then it would be by way of resolution oh ok sir I cut I can 't find the actual um chapter but um can we just I mean I don 't support reducing principally urban just requirements at the moment and have a look at that stunning design you know it 's just why would you allow average for ring blend buildings to be built when you have an opportunity to think about that relationship with the coast the relationship with the public development like it I actually think it 's important to encourage even those smaller developments to have some sort of urban design assessment and you know I appreciate that maybe if one big developer wants to come in and do a big development they 'll be captured but you know I think I just think it 's equally as important and I know the government has a different point of view I know that you 've been under you know strict instructions around the statement of the expects book expectation from the commissioners around chapter one but I personally if the government and the commissioners want to remove urban design they can do that I personally don 't feel comfortable that we are rejection Eliza urban design requirements and I encourage anyone to drive up for boaters street and look at what happens when it does nothing for the community it does nothing for the city and you get a whole bunch of ugly development sorry so I agree with yanni but what 's what sort of urban design guidelines are in existence now that stop shaadi let 's talk about New Brighton which is under revitalization so we want anything that 's happening need to be done right you 're talking about the operative district plan yeah there 's no there 's no urban design assessment and the operative plan at the present time which makes it difficult when assessing the statement of expectations to demonstrate a reduction in consents but you might want to go over what 's in stage one for the rest of the young casey 's so for other commercial centres been dealt with them phase one putting aside your item which is phase two we 've got a trigger which requires a qualitative assessment of urban design and that 's restricted discretionary activity and that 's for anything over 250 square meters and as well as those sites with a frontage of at least 20 meters also corner it 's not subject to consent then the standards in place in the proposed phase one rules which requires build up to the road for an glazing and veranda and so what we 're introducing in phase one is essentially combination of standards and if developments larger then there 's a qualitative assessment against a range of criteria but no no I can see where you 're coming from because you 're you 're wanting to enable new brighton to go ahead we 've got an indication of those both apartments going them which is a good signal that things are saying to happen out there but we don 't want to a risk that it 's going to be done wrong it 's really important it 's done right so is it is it right that we treat New Brighton differently just to enable it is there a risk that it won 't happen if we don 't do this and could I ask perhaps mark to very briefly if you can mark go over any submissions numbers or what the crown is saying in its submissions regarding urban been a numerous submission specifically from the crown but also other groups seeking that the urban design threshold sort of just spoken about in phase one that the deleted theirs in those submissions they 're arguing that it will not it will fail against the statement of expectations and and is some of the points I outlined earlier that it 's not enabling enough I reflected in the submissions so there 's arguably it says the development community but there 's concern that this is going to impede developments but that 's obviously coming from a range of organizations and and to some extent the statement of expectations as a statement of expectations does send a clear signal to us and the review that 's been undertaken of development and design standards does from a planner does signal that we are at the controlling end of the spectrum rather than enabling and and at this time the panel is going to view that potentially is inappropriate it 's not to say that you can 't make a decision and I 'll decision but perhaps I should also ask mark then 're not yet in court about evidence and the approach we might take the disc briefly and in a review of the urban designs provisions we need to consider what what we do to demonstrate that the plan is more enabling and we need to consider whether in fact we retain the qualitative assessment that is a trigger for urban design purposes and whether in fact we seek to rely on standards and apply standards to frontages Road frontages where there 's clearly going to be a character anticipated so what I 'm talking about there is you still have standards that require build up to the road front blazing and veranda treatments but only on those frontages where there 's a likelihood and it 's anticipated that that 's the outcome so for instance a long record and road you 'd expect the shops that front record in the road if there 's redevelopment of those shops or development of a vacant site that 's between a group of shops you expect that that site has developed up to the road front to provide continuity where the standards may the record in a mall set well back and you 've got car parking now to apply what a general standards which require any future development to be built up the road front is it raises the question of whether that 's likely to occur and whether that 's reasonable having a regard to the existing built form and and the fact that this is a plan of ten years and we 're looking at developments in a recovery phase so they 're some of the matters were considering but it 's by no means and the reason I 've asked Mike to do that is just very briefly to give you the context within which this will sit as part stage one approach and then there 's new brighton it 's not a matter for us to discuss now about further evidence and what 's happening that will be discussed at another subcommittee meeting but that 's just a bit of the context about how the rest of that chapter is moving the other thing is that we issues a whole bunch of work as a council to bring yeah which then this council voted to check out and that we could do it through the district plan now what we 've seen of course is we can 't do it through the district plan because of the statement of expectation so you know it is a difficult situation but again we 're giving this to the Minister for his comments I don 't think we should go back on our urban design standards at the start of a process of negotiation with the minister effectively I 'd rather have the minister in the government being you know saying they don 't like urban design and then we can consider it when we 've had those comments back but to change it at the start seems to me yeah not the approach that I wish we wish to take and you know I just yeah I mean I just think it 's yep what do you think guys is this a better we backlink customer pedal it 's just everything is into the draft to give to the minister to say we want urban design in our district plan there is no doubt what the minister 's response will be that 's reflected in their site and they phase one submission I guess by putting in Watson phase one and apply it to New Brighton we 're deferring the discussion to another another time really so should you wish to do this you would just say subject to and the amendment would be can i still apply director ian states the the draft version presented a workshop it is all rather to apply the same urban design rules as in stage one commercial chapter to the stage to commercial chapter yeah right in that something you obviously completely come from worth what we 've indicated to you what we think is highly likely to happen but let 's still your decision and should you wish this to go to the minister and and we would support it okay well I 'm you know I I 'm in the hands of the committee yeah but you 've heard the star of advice I 'm happy to second that this is said of these roles all they also applied whether is 20 the the rules limited to New Brighton what we sought to do in in the works draft workshop version was also add the word Barrington where spreyton appeared to provide clarity I see and that 's something we can do through phase one before the hearing to provoke at the inclusion in the workshop version of adding the word Berenson was more just clarification and ease of use for anyone that referred thought of the commercial center is Barrington rather than spray tantly though the these were also only about New Brighton or do they pertain to the other is 2 of the rules only applies to new version I shouldn 't_''_1000.519 I actually seconded that before kids okay you right actually it was secretive pool lane oh yeah I 'm yes you go for it then we should care of clarification what does that amendment then do to brighten does it effectively am has treated like the other centres subjects of suburban center master plans and the trigger is 250 square meters for any urban design assistant no I debate that at some point okay I 'd like with Jamie sure can I just see just um because please just raise a very bad point is that because we don 't have a mover and seconder for the original motion there this would become the substantive of this is the the feeling of can I get a bit of an indication though from you guys are you comfortable with where we going with us for this to be part of the substantive I tagged on to the paragraph one everyone 's relatively comfortable with that alright can I actually just ask a quick question of staff here but no one wants ugly built form totally appreciate that I guess whether the tension eanes is that there 's a thought to say of things are too onerous stuff just ain 't going to heaven you know and people will go elsewhere do you believe that what the amendment that yarn is suggested there will be going to that point that it just makes things too damn hard based on our response the response and submissions that that is what the indication that the development community will all find this on that perspective but it does tighten things to the extent that in light of what 's been what I 've heard from the panel in recent months and what my subsequent revisiting of the statement of expectations are I think it is unbalanced towards the controlling end and Hans are but having said that it 's it 's a matter still for consideration as part of phase one so I don 't think this is the best forum to discuss that no no no of course not but you know I guess we 're you know we 're we 're reliant on your professional guidance you know you 've gone through this process you understand it better than anyone and I 'll share everything the yarn said you know in theory but it 's the in practice type thing which you know we 've also got this so-called that 's correct I 'm not sure what number of expert witnesses mark has lined up for this chapter but one of them certainly will be somebody who will speak in detail about the impacts on the development sector and costs that interview perfectly honest you 've even seen previous quite we 've had things and where you know there 's aren 't insurance parts are anyhow there there have been more stands there and people just know they were hardly a whole lot of new brighton probably wasn 't even flourishing pre with quite even look at the central city wasn 't particularly flourishing then so uh I were actually feel more comfortable if we can sorry clear to do a bit of an about-face but I 'll move we have is the staff recommendation do I have a seconder for that and then we can then vote on the amendment on whether we add us or not so well with it that 's everything up to this point in in yani is basically added a bit there around the design controls or strengthening that so I 'm happy to accept that but as a matter of process we needed to have the first one okay great see original has moved and seconded and now we have an amendment on the table which is yeah it doesn 't change the really start illumination finishes at 2015 yes so it should we split the year and then the amendment starts subject to applying so 2015 and yeah in the amendment us there okay so removing sector the first one um any other questions or sgt the new brighton put into labor center curative center in category with tea rather than category c because I 'm concerned only including a moment New Brighton already include a commercial bank in the area plz in there already but if in category C no no commercial peg in the area so i 'm not sure whether is a property or not oh you 're referring to the table yeah yeah yeah yeah attachment yes yeah categories see is those neighborhood centers which are key activity centers yeah and the given primacy over other neighborhood centers in the hierarchy so we give greater support and the policy framework to New Brighton and and spray didn 't then we do to other sensors like each we 're in mirabel that 's based on direction in the regional policy statement and so effectively you 've got a series at the top district centres below that which are the likes of record in hornby and then barrington start spreading and new brighton and then have a census below that so it 's effectively giving greater support to people say this is a bid to sort of am i push to revitalize these areas which could do with a bit more investment pizza and secure the ones it 's not pin put the identification of New Brighton as a key activity center is not so much on the basis of its current stage but it 's not trying to push a bit more investment or vital as a that 's how I took it is that 's how it that 's what the policy is seeking to achieve but its identification is a key to the center is ingrained and a much broader framework which identifies these key nodes evenly distributed across the city to serve different population catchments okay and we 've got an amendment here we 're one minute over morning tea break two minutes over wanting to be right now so the amendment um I 'm yeah because I think although yeah any pigs to differ that he doesn 't think it 's a bad july i think you know everything feels a better we 've got a pic please baby the stuff wasn 't happening before the feedback leave feedback has been that 's been to over us I 've seen you know so many so many things at the moment which just aren 't stacking up getting investment in here is actually the real problem there is so much capital flight and it 's absolutely scary it really really is we don 't have half the levers to pull really older that but you know going out here to to why i think in making making it more difficult i don 't think it 's necessary the better that we need to be picking so in principle totally supportive of having things look prettier through through strengthening the design guidelines but they 're just as in the investment so i 'd rather a building there that 's okay as opposed to nothing and more and more money going way because honestly it is not stacking seeing right now is we 've got bankers accountants professional financial advisor saying put your money elsewhere it is too hard and that 's not even talking about then putting on design guidelines so that that 's where my concerns at at the moment so I 'm voting against the amendment Jamie I 'm voting against it as well of course a question that is consistently put to me in the community in relation to New Brighton is what 's the council doing for New Brighton my viewers we need to encourage this key activity center and its heyday of course as it had a monopoly on Saturday trading it expanded its forgotten to contract and now in through the master plan process of which mark has been a key part of that my view is that we need to encourage and and be more permissive for it rather than controlling we need to get it over the line takes you get it started and it 's been heartening to see that resource consent lodged in recent days I 'm hoping that something will come up there my view on yes to New Brighton we need to find a way to do that and we have a duty to look after the whole city this is a key part of our coastline and we need to ensure that it goes ahead right at the start of the whole district planning process Brigitte talked about finding the balance and so on the scales here I think we need to tip it that way to a more permissive approach so that that 's why I 'm voting against the amendment there something because we just need some real affirmative action out there for that community to get it going and I set your support on me does anyone else I yani I speak strongly in favor of the amendment we 've heard that people there 's been some convey that people don 't want us to be more controlling actually I disagree ninety-seven percent of people that commented on the central city living zones supported urban design an opposed removal of urban design standards the consultation we do on plan change 56 we had support for urban design standards we haven 't actually need more not less and it 's not about being controlling or not being enabling actually it 's about enabling vibrant and diverse communities to have an identity and a character rather than just be boring and bland and you know if you go to cities around the world where are the areas that people are attracted to hear is that have a difference areas have unique most areas that have character areas that have an identity so I don 't think we 're doing any service to New Brighton at all by removing urban design standards or assessments it just to me makes absolutely zero scenes to enable the large-scale development of an area without having even designed it just I thought as a society in a city in a country with progress in the last two decades to actually understanding that things like the record and westfields for example is not a good optimal outcome for City as it develops so you know I know the developers want us to remove all the rules in our district plan it 's the same thing that we hear every dcs they want us to remove any restriction on what they do but we 're also about building communities and I don 't believe you build communities by allowing low quality and ugly development in fact people have spoken very clearly through share an idea through central city through the plan change 56 they want improved even design not less so 250 meters is actually but still on I think is not enough but you know that 's a compromise that we got to a stage one and I you know I think even at 250 it 's still actually pretty permissive so I urge you to support the amendment don 't do a disservice to New Brighton by allowing it just to become an ugly suburb that gets developed in a really bland and boring way actually put something back there that actually gives it a character in an identity or I will put the amendment all those in favor say aye aye opposed carried sorry actually opposed no that again all those in favor say aye for the amendment I opposed no we 'll take a division on on the amendment suspense is killing me okay okay but though that can be obviously recorded though hasn 't it okay great so that 's that that that now becomes a substantive all those in favor say aye aye opposed carried mr. chairman just bring to your notice I 've added the words and accompanying section 32 at the top of the resolution and that should have also been there for the rural and residential chapter so are you comfortable that those resolutions still go through the previous ones for rural areas items everyone comfortable with it yeah okay we 're a wee bit later so i was actually plan to get back at five to eleven but take a quick morning tea break then and it 's five minutes all right with everyone will start and leave them just to try and keep trucking through this or just do you have some things you need to do it 'll take longer than five minutes you want a bit longer in _"

    "text": "yes and 16 o 'clock the aim then is to be through by 10 35 he 's good morning I 'm Sarah Oliver on the project lead for stage 2 of the residential chapter stage 2 involves a new set of policies an objective for the banks peninsula area it includes a policy for character areas in a set of associated provisions those provisions involve the development of two categories of character areas category one has a restricted discretionary activity status and that includes but only involves controlling development between the road boundary and the principal dwelling category two involves some site some metaphor specific controls such as Street building sit back and other zones and stage to include the residential establish new neighborhood zone which is the previously operative loving g 'zone that is just a rollover of all those provisions that were previously in the plan Opta plan that includes the residential Hill Zone which essentially as a rollover of the loving hill zone and included in that as some small parts of the living hell 's a areas that have been developed to a lower density it previously operative living Hills a and B zones and the akaroa hill slope zone it includes the residential small settlement zone which includes the banks peninsula small settlements areas and the small settlements of cayenne getting spencerville it includes the residential batch zone which was the previously living Taylor 's mistake zone that that has not been presented you in any great detail the Taylor 's mistake working party have considered options for that zone and have settled on one option which relates to the shi zhu li nan done scheduling of batches it has a change from the previously operative position different batches have been affected through the earthquakes due to geotechnical hazards and can no longer be supported for retention and another matter that has been considered and looking at the options for the talisman state batches and that has been that a number of the unusual beaches have existing use rights certificates so those two meters have the Working Party have reconsidered the options and broadly the option that is settling on is the retaining a similar number of batches but they will be different batches of point they were about six matches that were going to be removed on that point previously and they were originally offered up for removal through the mediated solutions so this was proceeding an environment court decision which established the scheduling and non-jew Jaleen of batches so it 's now proposed that those has been retained they 've been reassessed as terms of the impact on public access and it has been assessed that they do not impede public access and they do not have any geotechnical constraints on them so its proposed that they be retained however there are other batches and hobsons bay which will now need to be removed due to do geotechnical hazards so on balance is approximately about the same number of batches retained as previously and so that would be 15 batches to be removed in 31 batches to be retained that compares to the previous number we r 32 to be retained in 14 to be removed and balance of that though the working party would like to ensure that the total number of batches and the area remains the same this is including 're proposing to reduce the number of batches to be relocated in the new residential zone from 18 to 15 so that only provides the same number aligning with the numbers to be removed so 15 to be removed and only 15 to be provided for in the new batch sign this is new dozen area and for those of us not on the working party I don 't have a sense of this ok so I 'm sorry the pain a minute move can be replaced just the same number ok was it may take some time to explain and on page 177 of your draft provisions so the residential chapter page 102 cintas even do you have any pictures I don 't think it 's loaded out you 'll have to go to the paper copy I 'm sorry and so are you is all the recommendations and changes to marys but you 'll need to go to the actual draft chair that was provided to you yep paper copy yeah so page 177 there are two pictures there the one the first one is the development plan and the new batch zone was established through the Environment Court just 2003 decision to provide for the relocation or rebuilding of batches that were to be removed and in that zone 18 a maximum of 18 batches were to be provided for now that was greater than the number that we 're going to be removed so a provided for an additional three sorry additional for new batches over and above what was to be removed so the working party has considered that and in terms of a numbers they consider that that should be reduced to only provide for the number of batches to be removed so it doesn 't result a new develop you know total increase of batches in the area but just in terms of the ownership structure and the land ownership okay the land that all the land that the vectors are located on is council road zone so we are not here to discuss the matter of Licensing we are here to set out what the resource management grounds are for retention and removal of the cases so so there was a 2003 be a done deal basically if the environment courts ruled on it no so this is a review of the Environment Court decision based on the new information being the reassessment of the geotechnical hazards of the batches yeah yeah so previously there were some that were you know and I think it might be around 10 or that we 're able to be retained but they now have to be removed due to high risk and Kansas of rock forms of collect so the Working Party is suggesting the removal of batches where there is a high geotech hazard or for any other reason and if they are deemed to impede public eight days okay and how many in each category so there 'd be 15 batches to be removed yep and 31 batches to be retained but they are different set of batches they 're pretty they 're so of the 15 to be removed how many are because of geotech hazards in how many because of public access impeding and virtually all of the 15 to be removed are due to geotechnical peasants thank you that 's so now so those were the main areas so the resolution is that the chip to be approved to go to the Minister for comments there are some so on the maps that was printed for you there was a zone boundary era on one of Plenty met 52 this there was one site that was under stage one was not zoned residential banks peninsula zone but we consider that it should have been it was actually zoned for residential poopit as purposes under the operative district claim and there 's no known reason swipe this lien should not continue to be used for residential purpose so we recommend as part of stage 2 it be zoned in the residential beans peninsula zone there was a similar measure with even he 'd heaven previously it was a scheduled activity and that 's been scheduled activities have been considered as part of stage 2 but it wasn 't zoned as part as per the surrounding residential suburban zone so we 're proposing as part of stage 2 that that being the underlying zoning be changed to residential suburban zone again it plan we don 't consider there 's any reasons not to continue that zoning and there was just at the time of printing the proposed rezoning of the hawthorne road outline development plan area that a lone development plan wasn 't available at the time of printing but it 's now and ask that it be included as part of the set of provisions going to the ministers and there 's also some minor changes to the planting mix where we have just found some errors and the planting maps that were printed plenty Mets oh this is to do with Brooklyn 's the brooklands area there were a number of individual sections that had appeared on the printed copies a small settlement zone but they should have been located within the specific purpose flatland recovery zone to be considered as part of the you know the future of that area there was also some minor small sections that we found one on Penny met 69 it 's a very small section and it has been resigned from rural banks furniture to residential a small settlement but no assessment have planning met us additional material and there 'd be no assessment undertaken so we 're not in a position to recommend a change in that and so recommend it stay rural at the stage and penny matt72 again there 's another small section that ben 's own rural but under the operative planet was own small settlement zone and we see no reason why it should not continue to be used for residential purposes so we recommend it be raised owned residential small settlement zones so that those on the pinna max we 've just superb those for you where those areas are but they are all minor and really are areas rather than from the printed version and the only other matter is that to include additional material in the section 32 there was an appendix and it was the consultation document that was prepared on the living geez owns at the time of printing it wasn 't included so it 's just ask that that be included and part of the section 32 done road outline development theme can you just give us paragraph on what it is the stage 2 they are a number of reasonings proposed ones cranford basin which has been presented to you that 's 163 he is one is the 6.3 hit diaz and hawthorne road that 's an even just on the edge of a breeze okay so that development please the development plan there has just been developed with the landowners and sorry what does it involve oh it doesn 't just sits out the seat back from the Avon head road cemetery to deal with the reverse sensitivity effects of building close to the cemetery and it 's just a layout plan to ensure that it integrates with the adjoining area and provides the necessary stormwater management and wrote the residential development it 's a residential he 's again residential suburban no just just to clarify what Sarah said we 're not resigning the whole of cranford vary based on it 's just the areas of Highland around at the the residual areas that aren 't included in the notices of requirement we 're just working with a resident sir no reason a property owner and main road and red 2.8 meter cycleway you see in here that I click the road here is actually is one point I 've so quite now they 're saying that 's the new design standard but here we 've got 1.5 so I just want to get a bit of clarity on sorry we 're as a 1.5 this is on page 131 wickless main road let 's say one point eight metre cycleway he 's been told that say she via the new standard right the development plan that you 're looking at is to do with preston 's so all those development plans that are included from page and then it 's to do with the what is the living g 'zone so all those development plans that were developed for the each different greenfield area and have just been carried through so whatever was agreed to at that stage when that land development was approved by council through the rezoning have just been carried over so if there is a difference there it 's it 's really what was just considered appropriate for kristen 's development it was a any Allah is the infrastructure design standard and watch with it 's still its name there is going to be some inconsistency din oh the often is I mean when you look when you rezone a green field area they may come up with you know specific design elements that they want your like an arrow it might be a blend and you know Elaine design issue that they may have thought that it was more appropriate but generally you know any new subdivision as you know it is considered against the infrastructure design standard that 's okay if i could i know this is different visit the same could that be changed in other year is what like in red cliffs cadet designs going to be modified if it 's a subdivision consent yes they would be going for it would be part of the consent conditions so though if they 're not going for subdivision consent I 'm not certain how that would be being constructed and if it 's been constructed by the normally if it 's been constructed by the council they follow you know we follow subdivision consent well they will have that out through that with the subdivision consent officers is what 's appropriate for that area and you know it may be the fact that it 's got a land constraint it may not be able to be fitted you know be actually developed to 1.8 meters so it 's really a metaphor consent conditions do you have any more summary before going to recommendations or is it just you know not only sees any matter that you wish to discuss I office Jim Yardley quick question I think it 's really interesting point I think we 're losing an opportunity we 've just passed new cycle infrastructure design standards and we 're not putting it into our district plan so I you know I think we 're losing an opportunity what we should be asking for is that the outline development change plans are amended to reflect the new cycle design infrastructure standards and that should be a requirement think of noble subdivision and a whole tension that happened liat between not even complying with that infrastructure design standards around the cycleway so outlined development plans because I thought it gave people certainty the more I 've seen it is what it is is kind of a nice picture that people put at the start that she actually doesn 't make sense in a lot of different ways around timing or think so I guess the question I have is can we put in the new cycle design standards into these are mine development plans it would be a meta to wreck also see through the subdivisions chapter i 'm not actually Susan about whether there are any standards for cycle way works and the subdivision chapter but that 's a metaphor that chapter look can I my understanding is that the standards we 've been looking at that they are for the major cycleways the 13 and the network will include some of these are you know on shoots if you like and I guess the year so the standards we give our around those now they 're they 're not gold plated but that that 's what for those major ones so I 'm not sure what the other stands if end that a series indicated as some part some areas for example on the whole we 're in fact you don 't have don 't have a little room and I 'm not sure how we would actually actually make that all work at all well actually um as I understand that that 's not correct actually our infrastructure design standard the cycle stent design standards actually are not just a major cycleways but they do through the district play and look at things like collector roads so as you would expect so in recloser it 's not a major cycle way it 's simply what we 've been told is that because it 's going through a new capital works project it has to meet the new standards which I 1.8 on a collective road so you know I just think I mean I can we change our own development plans through this process I 'm in debt for even more and doing a question what I would ask is that you park that question until the subdivision development on earth we accept it comes along and if necessary well because the other thing that I was gonna ask is on 104 and I mean you know this won 't come as a surprise but we 're basically over truck we 're putting in more traffic lights into areas that you know I really question whether it makes strategic seems to have every block having a traffic light so 105 you 've got Trevor lights going in and you 've got for you look few pages later you 've got more traffic bites so can I just make a comment about these these suppose layers that have been included as appendices to the Preston 's road development have already been agreed to by council they 've gone through and the land development is already being you know it 's already been developed in accordance with these to begin to change make changes to they would have a significant impact on the lean developer because you know that 's how they 've laid out their development to meet these yeah i understand that fad but like we 're trying to put in suckle ways and become cycling friendly and we your cat what we 're trying to achieve cycleways which i think is a real lost opportunity so i don 't know if it 's possible but to me it seems really all right look it so that points noted but as staff advice i think be something do here is like that for the for the subdivisions chapter okay in the traffic lights potentially with when we have David Faulkner here with transport bicycle thing the so-called lanes if we park it to a subsequent chapter what happens if we 've got conflicting buts oh we would there is a resolution at the end to make and consequential changes depending on how decisions are made so that we can find out if necessary we can come back and make a dough solution so we have it wasn 't necessary just made our bed then at the end of this fraternity okay Phil and I think it 's a we pack up to the relationship that that 's fine I 've lend it to you because we 're talking about this specialized area of cycle waves of someone from the he 'll check to me yes it 's a bit sounds great okay we 've got 25 minutes for too much yard chapters that we need to get through it it better be a really important one otherwise we won 't get through out one corridors so where has that come from ok so the is previously presented to you the it betters the policy that is to provide the guidance for the new proposed accommodation a community facilities own there is a new corridors that would provide for a mix of guest accommodation larger-scale community facilities and medium density development and that 's along parts of be liev anew and we actually just the northern side of Bailey Avenue part of pepper no erode and part of racket and row so that reflects really the level of land development that all the types of activities that have already established along those zones that we discuss it in some detail didn 't have control okay yeah so I 'm yeah and and then the special minute II areas we 're strengthening our way so that 's the other key thing they have been categorized as category 1 and 2 category 1 and they deemed to have be most intact in terms of their level of integrity and category 2 just target specific matters of such a sit back and it could be landscaping and there 's a new rule proposed and therefore front entrances in terms of the fact that we provided to face the street so it 's those elements that are proposed for the category too but it 's restricted discretionary for category 1 so that considers multiple matters I will say that the difference in the city so that the Christchurch City part is the restricted discretionary activity it only applies between the road boundary and the main location of the main building so so it 's just really that Street interface on the residential conservation zone and littleton and our corolla the restricted discretionary activity applies to the whole of the site and that 's simply because they 're elevated that 's a really good idea can we do that as well can we do that as well or the crop crusher well that 's that amenity meter so that 's that 's the issue that we 're you know looking at that what level of regulation is appropriate it 's not appropriate for the whole of the site because it 's only about Street immunity he 's saying that then I 've I don 't know how many other people had the development in Eli straight where the lady couldn 't even open her window because the garage got built right up to with a window opened in a character area so it 's an old character cottage been there since you know 1900 or whenever so actually you know it does seem to me that it 's pretty fundamental you might have a bunch of nice facades and a whole bunch of hideous stuff but that has no interaction I mean it will impact on the neighborhood so well that would be that would be controlled through other standards I 'm not Susan I 'd have to that sounds like a very unique situation where something was granted the air and have to look at that in more detail but I don 't see any of the other standards that it because they 're still subject to all the other standards for the rest of the site hmm all right then guys I 'm sorry to rocket us along others we 've got 10 minutes 24 vote for questions and presentation of commercial industrial so I 'll try and keep it moving as much as I can through the chair we are in your hands I imagine that we might be able to make up time as we move forward in the afternoon with some of the smaller chapters but I did put the larger chapters up first so that you would have plenty of time to discuss them great I 've appreciate that I was hoping that we could be nice and that you guys could get away we lived with 45 but anyway we 've got a recommendation up there Jimmy 's delighted to move there engine yep Andrew to see conduct all those in favor say aye aye opposed carried okay chapter 15 right commercial I 'm just going to outline what 's changed since the _"

    "text": "is relating to the rural chapter but also covering off some updates to the open space and Papa clinger chapters at the same time because it relates to the same topic of the landscape features in layers so a key update as the integration of a significant landscape currently known in the bank 's Lynch the plan is the rural amenity landscape into the zone based chapters drawing on the provisions for the rural amenity landscape and the banks mention a plan the Royal chapter has been amended to more fully integrate these landscape provisions this needs to be done more fully for the open space chipped and Papa creo chapters and this will be discussed under the resolutions in terms of content the provisions of the operative plan rule amenity landscape have been generally carried over or amended as appropriate to retain the intent in key principles and provisions of the rural immunity landscape provisions are also provided as an attachment to the open space and rural chapters for the significant landscape in the form of policy framework and assessment measures so what this integration means is that the can be considered within the context of the landscape overlay provisions to confirm the rural immunity landscape currently and exponential has been renamed a significant landscape with respect to other landscape layers in banks peninsula such as the outstanding natural landscapes and natural features in natural character in the coastal environment for banks peninsula the open space and rural chapter rural chapters also contain a set of provisions relating to these landscape overlays again this is so that the zone and landscape overlay provisions can be considered together these provisions are shown as an attachment to the open space and rural chapters some changes have been made to the provisions and those attachments to provide for some improvements in some minor changes such as to assessment medal routing policies and roles but essentially the intent is very similar the landscape natural character topics for banks peninsula as lometa for chapter 9 natural and cultural heritage when that chapter has gone through their approval processes and onto notification just to note it is only the bank 's financial at landscape and natural character provisions which are included within the zone chapters considered only with the chapter 9 natural and cultural landscape and drew course would you like me to move on to the resolutions and so just to make it clear again this is relative to rural zone chapter the open space chapter into Papa kya and relates to landscapes features and natural character do you want to go through the resolutions one by one would mmm it 's my if there 's any quick questions on us I don 't have one update to one of the resolutions number six just to make it clear that that applies to the Papa crying as own and there 's also a different related definitions resolution but I understand it 's coming forward and the definitions to I don 't think you need to go through one by one but I guess if there 's any questions from anyone on the body of them you have you time any questions from anyone so clean in yani thank you I guess having them the different chapters is self-evident really just because they yeah because it 's what it is yes and obviously because land want to see all of the implications and effects on their property when they put a submission and rather than making them wait for a chapter that 's coming a month or two later want to be clear I 'm crazy I wasn 't_''_241.07 those previously we were voting on the whole rural chapter not just the coring resolutions I was happy to support the increased public notification that was in those going resolutions that we were adding I wasn 't comfortable support the whole rule chapter so I don 't that can just be amended but just specifically on those I just want to be really clear that around the the rural areas we 're not reducing the protection for significant features and landscape overlays we 're actually strengthing those through the other chapter is that correct sorry sir just to confirm your question it 's whether we are strengthening them or not yes if you look at point one you say remove the outstanding some of the features and landscape overlays and areas of natural character ways and the coast from the planning Maps except those and banks only measures that are up for consideration at this time relevant to this topic area of landscape layers and natural character is relating to banks peninsula so the landscape features and layers which are shown on for the city area don 't need to be and the plenum maps at this time they need to be doing chapter 9 comes up for your consideration right which is that they will still be considered him yeah at that time and is there anything that 's enabling increased residential development and rural science particularly in the in the city area so putting the banks peninsula to one star is there anything that 's enabling more residential dwellings in rural areas what 's in them within the city no so what holes etc the existing minimum of sight sizes for operative district plans has been carried over so there is no increase in the ability to establish any further dwellings and in particular on banks peninsula it 's matched by the current banks clinching the plan in it reflects where outstanding landscapes exist as well so there 's no increase at all and we 're about to do if you think about them that 's why one of the issues is of course we haven 't done we haven 't done the geotech natural hazards to the degree that we 've done it in the city but I do worry that we are enabling development in some of those areas that 's equally as risky it 's just that we haven 't actually spent the you know hundreds and millions doing that research because it wasn 't badly impacted by the earthquake that has been considered however the rules relating to what you 're talking about will be in the stage to natural hazards chapter that 's coming to you also am I to change some of the rural zoning no no it won 't change any of the rural zoning what it will do is add overlays and yeah and just the final question for me as I just where we got to with why no II is why no you 're being enabled to be developed more and what are the requirements for the developers to provide the infrastructure that 's of the residential chapter that still to come so we 're just talking about finishing off the rural chapter here in relation to what we 're taking out of the natural and cultural chapter and putting it into the rural chapter so that landowners of rural areas can sort take that into consideration will come on to winery it rimmel next topic but just so we 're not taking any of rural winery and putting it into the residential this stage as I 'll discuss on the residential chapter there is no proposed new zones as part of the stage to residential chapter to the small season that 's all we have done is put a policy framework together that would guide and the future rezoning proposals and as I stated at our last meeting we are aware of some land development proposals that may be coming and may appear through submissions but at this stage we haven 't considered anything in great detail cool we have six recommendations up there is someone that is prepared to move that hmm seconded Paul all those in favor say aye aye opposed _"

    "text": "all chapter just um I 'll just give you a moment to find that chapter in the section 32 shall we press on thank you good morning and I 'm Debbie Hogan senior policy planner and checked a leader for for the rural chapter I 'll just provide you with a brief introduction to the chapter the rural chapter managers rules owned land which covers a large part of the city the overall outcome for rural land is to have a productive and diverse rural environment so the chapter seeks to achieve this through maintaining a rural working environment and supporting the rural economy by ensuring rural activities have a direct relationship or dependency on the rural resource natural feature or a rural activity it 's also going to be achieved mainly through managing rural dwellings and making sure that they 're established that appropriate densities to maintain character and avoid rural residential development and ensure that that supports a consolidated urban form in particular around the peri-urban fringe of the Christchurch main urban area so its proposed to have six rural zones each zone is distinguished by its geographic of rural activities are provided for and based around farming and plantation forestry with a range of activities that support rural land use including rural tourism recreation and the ability to sell and add valued products grown or produced on site development controls have been kept to a minimum to maintain rural character or rather to focus on maintaining rural character and managing effects and clue reverse sensitivity effects on rural activities most of these rules are similar to the operative plans including minimum site size and there are no significant changes proposed a restrictive approach has been proposed in the rural urban fringe zone and this is the area the zone that adjoins directly adjoins the main urban area christ and christ church and the flat land and and a restrictive approach is proposed due to existing land use intensive land use pattern and the number of pressures that are placed on this area from the urban environment in particular this includes limits on dwellings and subdivision on sites less than or creating sites less than four hectares to avoid any further rural resident residential development and this is regional policy statement in the land use recovery plan a number of minor changes have been made to the chapter following the version discussed with counselors in January this has been undertaken to take account of legal reviews achieving the statement of expectations and in particular integration with the banks peninsula landscape provisions of chapter 9 which Caroline will outline shortly and you will see that the rural chapter has expanded and as a result of inclusion of these landscape provisions for banks peninsula the key changed since January is in response to discussions with counselors on querying activity related to the rural flatland the provisions that you see before you now include notification clauses for acquiring activity within 500 meters of a residential zone since the chapter was printed earlier on in the week an amendment has been proposed to address further concerns over querying in excavation within one meter of the seasonal high water table the activity status is to be amended from discretionary to non-complying this retains the status quo of the existing operative plan activity status and the resolutions proposed before you reflect these changes that time to go through the resolution I I can go through the resolutions for you and try just ask a quick question Ned through Chi and terms the Deputy Chair just with consents we 've you 're probably aware been having a conversation about the court aggregate that 's the combined group aggregate corryong and applying it you will be aware of this so I guess it 's just joining up those two stations applying for what is it variations okay so in response to to those recent changes for the 1-meter seasonal high water table the resolutions outlined those changes so in particular for the rural quarry zone and currently we have it listed as a discretionary activity its proposed to delete that replace that with the non-complying activity so this is where you excavate within one meter of that water table and there 's been subsequent changes to delete references to matters of discretion actually hold on there needs to be a slight correction to Point C and apologies instead of the second column discretionary it needs to be amended to non-complying yeah just two yep it was also reflect where the scoring activity will occur and where the ground water resource exists we also need to include the non-complying activity in the rural urban fringe which is resolution three and resolution for also include the same provision in the rural waimakariri zone and which directly adjoins Waimakariri River and then as a result of those changes the fifth resolution really is about addressing them value including that evaluation in any amendments within the section 32 just clarify the residential zone that 500 metres is required to be notified from is that any residents or is that a residential zone it 's weird it as a residential zone boundaries so anywhere that there is a residential zone it will be 500 meters from that boundary where there are existing houses and uses and the last ones gone within eighty eight meters of a house how is that impacted is that the 250 meter so no it it it is written to have regard to that zone boundary regardless of whether there are dwelling there or not so if it was in particular there 's areas that have been fully establish their development so the way the rule is written it will be directly from that residential zone boundary even if there is no dwelling me so we 're currently are going out with 250 meters that you can 't quarry within a residential zone curr and in another 250 meters from that residential zone you must publicly notifier yes so 500 meters publicly notice for those existing houses and especially in the your twist road area that are established i 'm not sure what their zone is and how close a quarry may continue to encroach on those houses yeah so those existing houses in your house road a zoned rural that part of the rural urban fringe so the way the rule has been written is that that only is from a residential zone boundary any dwelling that has established in the rural environment whether they 've been there for a long time or a new and won 't have the same limitation the protection they are required though if it 's a new dwelling going into a rural environment there is a separation distance that they on the dwelling new dwellings going in it doesn 't deal with and existing dwellings so for those existing dwellings who have now got a quarry 88 meters from their door what protection does this provide against querying encroaching basically Wow okay man well this is the matter of Revere sensitivity when people choose to live an acquirer zone when they undertake the purchase of the property it 's on their owners to understand what can happen in that quarry zone and as we know these rules aren 't retrospective it kept we can only write rules with respect to and what do I was saying about a buffer zone for how to exclude them from a certain area from a quarry when it 's a new house that 's going in for those existing houses how do we actually protect them from a quarry on their back doorstep actually like because they are getting dis resource consents to come closer and closer what 's it saying yeah yeah if it 's if it 's within the rural quarry zone that the activity is being undertaken in there are restrictions an expansion outside of the corazon it will require a discretionary activity consent so at that point those existing dwellings will be taken into consideration so they do have an opportunity to be considered to be a fit considered yes in a way then that we could do what Amy Adams was suggesting and actually make sure that those are all publicly notified by having that public notification hearing done by councillors or their local community board any and as I understand it under fairly recent changes to the Resource Management Act and Eckland can request to have an independent commissioner and if that 's the case then that 's what will happen the applicant has that opportunity for the hearing or for the public motive for the here in 94 the hearing it but for the section 95 the cancer laws or the local community board could be there fiction 95 would have to come back to you on that I understood that that delegation is given to the resource consents manager but I would have to come back to you on that okay but presumably it 's a that component and I couldn 't answer without having some good advice around the wording of that seasonal high water beer and it seems to me that you can you put I 'm not quite sure is there ever is that like a set set table for right throughout the year or does it vary I might have to defer to a down we 're on coming from is that seasonal especially with climate change varies much more quickly and you know that consumer concerns me that we might be relying on on a part of the year my understanding is all we 've divert to Environment Canterbury for that information and so they have their own monitoring but the actual seasonal high water table I can 't recall the exact monks I think it 's between September and April where by the way around April in September sorry yeah so that 's when they determined that the highest water levels are and then we get an application and we would liaise with Environment Canterbury for dough for that data and think of that but and I guess like what know we had flooding in the water table would have been much higher and so it just concerns me that you know in other months in fact that the echo file aquifers may also be at risk I guess that would be a situation where you 'd have a I don 't have the data no I appreciate a sneak in may they monitor about yeah but yeah you 're assuming that scenario that could have a you 're indicating we could have a peek a high water table outside of the typical high water months which would be rather unusual but yeah but we do not that essentially how I have been the highest season yeah I don 't have that data we know do we know why it has to be seasonal like why can 't we just have a effects point we need to be consistent with Environment Canterbury yeah and they use that seasonal high water table and because we were relying on their data and they 're monitoring and that 's what by using we don 't have different data to look at a different appreciate your position I guess just in terms of what Ikki and might have I can 't_''_864.47 be entirely comfortable with us still I 'm making it needs to be the discussion where you came a time where we have to assign myself today just in relation to that so he can have a rule in their land and water plan where it 's a restricted discretionary activity to do exactly the same thing for an excavation within one meter of the seasonal high water table so if somebody is coming to us for a resource consent they also need a consent from a can so as part of any dupree application discussion the applicant would go to e can and the first instance to determine what that seasonal high water table was and then if they were coming within that one meter and then they would submit essentially a joint application as per what has is currently being submitted to both councils at the moment things do you could i also just did just for your information i understand that the mirror is wanting to write a letter to urgently and to bring these issues to the to the Minister for the environment next month for some potentially urgent action at definitely for further research on the accumulation of these types of consents coming through so if that letter went out fairly quickly then there will be at least a six month gap before this matter is huge by the hearing panel in which potentially something could happen I think that is a discussion obviously for my decisions today that the perhaps your committee and should discuss what he can with regards to you should actually just be one level rather than seasonal because it does fluctuate and therefore as a possibility that some quarry could actually end up and the water table level that is a possibility but what do be saying is currently by law we have to be consistent with and give effect to regional plans and policy statement so there 's ERPs but there are other regional plans to such that a lender water plan which has rules in it relating to this so the the what I 've just seared about the mere writing on changes to those regional plans that depends what they decide but the possibility is that through that the plans that we have down that which was signing off there 's actually if you want technically a fault because they did through no one 's that they could actually be is that the water tables very through the seasons it could actually be intermittently quarry going into that there could be but we don 't have any research to justify why I totally understand but understand that for us as a councillor something soonish something we should be talking with a keen about yes that 's right and that 's that will be happening sorry we can 't hear you so is that wording that you 've put in there about the seasonal high water is that the actual weekend wording in the air sir and you said around and water please Rihanna and the issue of the existing houses I appreciate their in a different zone but the quarry 's are going incredibly close and in some cases destroying existing businesses as well and so that such that we district plan review but just a note that we remember to do it that we look at the possibility of the community board being section 9 25 10 relevant pretty bored problem Isis so what we 'll need to get is some legal advice for you on that that 's what you 're saying okay so there 's a note just to say and request legal advice for opportunities to for the community board to be a part of the am notification decision framework and preps if fo you of course might also note that the young weekend committee have discussions with indicating around this issue so we make sure we do have those I 'm sure you all know can I just check minus things we can make this a publicly notified activity so I 'd rather just do that then leave it to the discretion of a hearings panel I think there 's certain activities in our city like PD centers like Warren that the community actually want to be notified on and I have no qualms about actually just saying an edge astre plan that they will take that approach if we can can we well what exactly are you asking what the year covered notified activity quarries and rural zones where they 're allowed to quarry yep with inventory system certain distance of residential but but we have got that Debby 's already told you we 've got that of residential zones we have got that and here is there a way is there a way that we can extend their to residents and residences as opposed to designs for the 250 meters well this is what I was talking to you about before this is the reverse sensitivity of people choosing to know to to reside in a rural area you could do that for queries you could also do it for spray drift you could do it for noise of cows or whatever I mean this is the problem with people who decide to live in certain areas and of course farmers will want to locate in the middle of the business which is in a rural area but but these are the these are the difficulties that the balance that needs to be the most recent case that we had in roberts road the commissioners looked at a 250 meter buffer zone as being at the minimum as being appropriate for all sorts of noise dust and all sorts of other things but what we 're doing is allowing queries that are encroaching on existing residences albeit in a rural area to go much closer than 250 metres I think there 's actually two different things one is the existing rural quarry zones which have existed for a length of time and we are retaining those in the ability for queries to continue in there as over time yes there have been further intensification of dwellings with a net vicinity so the current planet she already has a separation distance for any new dwelling moving into that area needs to be 250 metres from the boundary of a legally established quarry so we have carried that across so so the onus is then on any new dwelling moving into that area to meet that separation distance if they can 't they need to consent and then for any quarrying activity outside of those the range of assessment matters that need to be considered will include whether or not they meet industry standard sipper raishin distances which is based around the 250 meter so just in terms of nearly not sticking to the 250 meter right those are previous consent applications that have occurred and they will have reasons behind why they allowed a lesser distance so we have reinforced the priorities for the rural environment in the complicated issues are around coring within this revised policy framework in the district plan and I believe it as has been strengthened our assessment matters have been strengthened I believe we 're sending a clear message about quarrying certainly within close proximity to a residential zone which is fantastic for the guild with up see ya yeah and i think the flip side of that is recognizing it 's a rural environment chorong as a legitimate rural activity and we need to provide for that and providing for it we 've recognized that has adverse effects we have taken account to those or required an appropriate activity status so I believe that the framework that we and future and soon I have is that we 're actually so to go into the seasonal high water table it 's probably notified to clinics or residents it 's not so I would have thought the resident should be able to we 're not saying stopping the activity but we 're enabling the resident actually be involved in the decision-making so that the adverse effects can be discussed mitigated etc so so if you look at page to be fear with this Johnny they 're like you just you 're asking the same question in a different way though I understand what you say and what you 're saying is that you 'd like a resident to be notified of that however if their reason was chosen to live inside a rural area the inquiring as legitimate activity so the feet before go on that within a certain distance so if you take three and four all I 'm saying is I kind of see why we can 't put that last sentence into those other rolls around coroner relative to residential re you 've got then a quarry 250 meters to a residence it may and that will be considered as part of that application and it may be declined on that basis or does it just has been well it may be approved with conditions to mitigate those effects so and that 's just that 's part of that consenting process that needs to be considered so what do you want to move Danny if you read we don 't star just I don 't quite know how to quickly reference the rules around the residential as there are um page with a coring one games on the zone how about how much more do you have this cuz when we get to the resolutions we know there 's going to be a resolution at the end and maybe if you 've gotten a minute you can think about the wording for that and bring that to the end how much longer do you have on the rural chapter well that 's I mean we 're here to answer your question oh and Caroline 's just going to get an update information to justify sorry can I of the rural environment where you talk about it being and sorry I 'm sorry hello nice can you move back up please productive and dove is that was not included in the reason that no other one it 's yep is it part of the objective that it be productive end of the story problems yes is there any environmental objective in the rural zone such as where such as I don 't know protection of water or anything no not in the rural zone you you might recall that we made that agreement that it in the natural cultural heritage chapter but I also still understand there is an objective a high level objective in the strategic directions chapter which we won 't know whether that succeeded or not until we get the first lot of decisions so in the strategic directions chapter we have a high level objective that is about protection of the groundwater aquifer we had yes and what we need to work well I I don 't know what is then we don 't know the act until the decision is released which i but we don 't know the decision and it 's also in the natural and cultural heritage chapter which is yet to come to you right in the rural chapter does include references to it throughout the chapter there is one reference to groundwater in relation to policy 17.1 point one point team which is relates to the location of management acquiring activities and in particular it 's one of the criteria in terms of avoiding particular locations for chlorine so as I said previously I believe that we have quite a strong policy framework and we 're sending a clear message and that combined with the policy in chapter 9 in strategic directions can you show us the areas where we are avoiding quarrying and just in relation to what you 've seen is that possible reserves and you will know you will have been well it 's not so much avoiding that 's a consideration that we need to take into account when a consent come and see yams and so yeah so there aren 't actually areas on the maps at sea this is where we 're if somebody is looking for a new quarry site they will look to the rural chapter and look through the policies and see what that is telling them and then what activity status they need to to jump through and then we will use these policies and seeing any application so they could be a reason to actually decline and that the activity is not protecting groundwater from the effects of filling and use and storage of hazardous substances so unless they can prove otherwise it could be a reason to go to be of those like when it comes over those cross-reference those links so people can find their way from for example major objectives to the rural chapter there a cross referencing in the e plan and you mean to read them together as a package anyway like we can make sure that there is cross-referencing cotton there thank you once these chapters go into e plan right thank you and will we help everybody okay yep I 'm quarrying and just in relation to the community board submissions so we 've gone stayed at non compliant because which is already different to the regional plan where it says restricted discretion yeah for this type of activity so we think that 's as strong as we can go it 's Thea capacity for the community boards to put in submissions suggesting stronger rules and I believe stage 1 you allowed their community boards put in their own submissions so I would have thought that you had continued with that approach yes and this is why and the mayor has suggested that she will bring this to the attention of ministry for the environment and again right do we have a set of recommendations of you need us one decision on now eyes yet go for you um so on page 20 you do have the coring within 250 as 250 or more from a residential boundary zone boundary so they 're really the only difference we were talking about previously was their efforts next to a residential dwelling and you 're saying that we can 't do that because those dwellings are in corazon and it wouldn 't wouldn 't be fair when those dwellings would be in would need to be notified because of the way that dwellings are scattered throughout the rural environment and I think personally I would find it difficult to support something like that just purely on the basis of how this chapter has been developed which is like I say the premises is a resource out there it 's a legitimate rural activity we 're managing dwellings that locate within that area and yes when you 're dealing with a very complicated existing situation out there but the onus is really on any new dwelling coming into that area takes that responsibility to locate the government is this team dwelling those existing dwellings yes or no that I that they are difficult to deal with but once again it 's the then the responsibilities on the coring activity and we would assess the appropriate distance which they may or may not be able to achieve I think that that 's the thing for me is that if you think about the RMA its purpose to mitigate adverse effects on the environment and allow for sustainable development and it seems to me that of which zone its own should have a fundamental right it took me I would have thought with the activities like coring with the adverse effects that it will generate to actually be notified if it was happening next to them that may just seems like a really fair thing to expect it 's not to say that coring has been delivered in those areas I understand this a need for it but what I can 't understand is why we would remove the right for the person will not make it explicit that the right of those people that are adversely affected to be involved in that discussion when the consent is approved particularly if it was even closer than 250 which it seems like it could be and it 's wouldn 't necessarily be probably notified well that 's a decision that would be made as part of any consent application received firstly you have to identify affected parties if you can 't get their consent and that 's a reason to notify or that operator might just choose to notify the application or as a result of consents team decide then it needs to be noted for we could just decide now and put it in the plan I would have problems with putting it on now because as you as you rightfully seed its to also allow for the sustainable use of natural resources now these zones are in those places where these natural resources are located and for residential activities the primary use of those zones is for residential activities so to put every single consent out for notification when that can be judged at the time of they can send potentially is a misuse of that notification clause it can be decided at the time of the application and this needs to be defended I or defendable by our our officers and their professional opinion there and we 've heard the answer that 's not the case i can understand what you 're saying around I understand yeah I understand the pressure pointed it at both sides of the spectrum but in all honesty okay this is a rural zone and I understand what you see it I appreciate that and also we are to whether community boards and or counselors can be a part of that decision making regarding notification yeah 250 meters of someone 's house if those owned in a residential a rural area that there 's no guarantee that that notification notified that activity there 's no absolute guarantee like nine ten meters from the house and I could basically say that I 've gotta run to sign it and I could say that it 's going to be no adverse effects that 's correct but it is a food discretionary concerned but know that it 's a mystery person take aunt just say that you 've got everyone to sign that you know like well actually this is what happens yep action because every sign sign it means they 've given the consuming waiver just but there objection to any of them and equipping us I don 't even ask Jerry I 'm not even ask so Roberts road for example right next to a major residential community before this part of our district plan was altered not one of those residents was notified despite the request from the notified but how many meters was that from the room oh they 're commissioners established at 250 meters the risk is that it will actually go closer and that hints the very grateful for this going in the district plan and I hope it leads to get very quickly because the risk is that they want to go even closer so what 's what 's your suggestion what what 's defendable is from your perspective and the pragmatic way forward well there are two issues here it 's what Debbie feels as a professional planner that she can support but then there is also the issue of what will get past the minister 's comments given that there we care we 're currently in recovery mode and then there is a certain amount of aggregate that 's required for that I don 't know how the government might might see this kind of a clause I guess but um anyway look you 've got some have you got something that you would like to oh let 's get this movement seeking that I quit staff we 've gone back to moved up the scale of liberality we 've gone back to non-complying and that 's as far as we can go can I just be clear what is the penalty in any law for anyone creating damage in our aquifer that causes major remedies to be needed I would need to get you some legal advice on that Thanks right okay move Paul zero cigna for whatever via le all that which tests at all those in favor say aye aye opposed the only one that recorded okay so that 's carried now there is a second lot of resolutions relating and directly to rural that I 'll ask Caroline to go through now well good morning everyone and so these are updates _"

but I 'm here the whole day apart from potentially taking a little nap this afternoon for a quick meeting but yeah project you want to kick off with chapter 17 the rural which includes quorum for Vicki I yani on the agenda I just want if we can take morning tea at like 1030 so that those of us can go to Norman Cook call and in your hands drives whatever you 'd prefer I just find it really difficult that we 've got major council facilities opening during what times does Norman Cook opening but we 're not gonna have like an hour more continue or something so exam look I just think who I won 't be attending the opening but obviously for those that wanted it 's actually they 're cool and great who is attending okay what is there anything in that time that you are you really really is your number one star priority issue that will catch with that and I can delay your item perhaps well no I just want to take a pre-medical project if the if you 're not here you 're not here but if there 's really something you want to be it will will will push pause on it but otherwise let 's just stick with the agenda and if you 're not here you 're not here and that 's fine all right Brigitte good morning counselors and welcome to the second stage of the district plan review today we 've got 15 it is a large agenda and what I propose that we do if you 're agreeable the chair is that we go through each chapter and we take resolutions at the end of that chapter because there are some some additional material that we need to add in and some changes that have occurred even since you 've received these chapters so if that 's okay with you that 's the process will take and I just reiterate for your benefit that there are exceptions to the stage to chapter everything that 's going forward today the process will be that they go to proofreading and then they go to the ministers on the second of March who have 15 working days to consider the chapters the draft chapters in the section 32 and give us their comments by the 13th sorry 23rd of March then this committee meeting will reconvene to consider the minister 's comments and have particular regard to them and decide which comments that they will choose to change the the chapters by then it will all go into e plan and then notification on the time frame are the natural hazard stage to chapter the natural and cultural heritage chapter in three specific purpose zones that 's real pune the special purpose airport zone and the flatland recovery zone and we 've been through the reasons for why that has occurred and resolutions have being passed for that purpose there are two early resolutions up there before we get started that I would like you to consider please and that is that the central chapter Central City chapter also be delayed until the same time of notification of the natural hazards chapter later this year and the second notation is simply to ensure that the maps do not include the area of the future notification area which is the flatland recovery zone so the second one is simply procedural since you 've already made a resolution on delaying the flatland recovery zone but the first one is to ask for your agreement to hold back the Central City chapter we need resolution in for that do I have a move it move by tongue I 'll see conduct yep so I got moving a seconder rationale for delaying Central City and because the chapter isn 't yet really in a complete enough state for it to be able to come to you so do we have anything at the moment that we can put in that would require some sort of urban design assessment in the central city to stop through the ugly development yes there is something in the yes but I prefer not to discuss it until we 've talked about it with you at the time that it comes to you for for adoption to go to the ministers it 's not yet in a fit enough state to come to you that 's why I 'm asking for a delay around the same time as the natural hazards chapter so that comes to you from Emory it was six weeks post the second of March okay I mean I 'm concerned but I understand that you know the government only have just released their living exactly stuff for the central city so they took two years so six weeks delay but I think it 's really important that we do have number of quite ugly development happening in the central city and it 's a real shown we 're lost opportunity yeah but also the balancer we want to see development as well so anyway so this does give us more time to deal with that detail because that 's coming with the natural hazards we 've got a mover and a seconder all those in favor say aye aye opposed carried thank you now we 'll invite DB Hogan to the table and Caroline wreckling to talk with you _"

John Thompson 's name is synonymous with cricket and Christchurch and Canterbury John as president and grounds convener of burnside cricket and since retirement has also taken on a full-time voluntary role as the groundsman for the club rising early to prepare five wickets during the season John continues to do this at the age of 79 I hope you don 't mind me saying putting up practice Nets marking out for pictures repairing the old mower and rollers maintaining the club rooms and looking up at the end of days play John 's commitment and dedication to the sport and the youth there hours days and years he has committed to this enterprise are immeasurable and invaluable burnside cricket is among the larger cricket clubs and New Zealand and a local institution that I think my uncle has a little but to do with been so close yeah that 's why here as well oh I was hoping you 'd say that hundreds or perhaps thousands of youngsters received their first taste of cricket here arriving with the appearance on Friday evenings and summer or saturday mornings to be introduced to John who would make sure they receive the guidance the instruction and practice they needed seniors juniors and beginners joined the club and for many it was the beginning of a lifelong Association when it came to rolling up his sleeves and doing the back-breaking work of mowing and rolling he was the hands-on club president he did at all he was team selector and once manager of the under-20 team touring Australia he was manager of Canterbury crickets from 1995 to 2005 burnside cricket is the future of cricket and Christchurch and thanks to the dedication of individuals like John I think it is both timely and appropriate for us to recognize honor and come in John and this council chamber today as we play host to the Cricket World Cup 2015 and it is fitting that tonight as the opening ceremony of the Cricket World Cup soon and tonight will be carried away with all of the excitement of that ceremony the fireworks and then on Saturday the beginning of the one day international encounters and the higley oval there is pause as a city to pay tribute to john fraser thompson his exceptional contribution to the development of cricket and Christchurch to his commitment to the support that we celebrate today and his dedication to all the young players whose talent and skills have been nurtured by Burnside cricket I 'm delighted to present the Christchurch Civic award 2015 to you on behalf of the Christchurch City Council and a grateful community I think I think John 's gonna say a few words so I 'll hand over to you thank you very much Leon thank you very much counselors thank you very much for this honor it world cup which I have had some input into has is going to capture this nation it also has got to put Christ Church on the map which i think is even more important we 've been without a home some 15 years of any significance I manage the camry cricket team for four yomps they got sick and tired of me so they tossed me up that was good but we we did not have a home as such and we couldn 't entertain or host other associations that came to cost you to naturally we did but we either we got to play qe2 play train you or go to Prague Lincoln and it was it was a hotchpotch now that Kendrick cricket has got a home at hagley park I think it 's marvelous well I know that the the whole of the council is not totally with it but I think in the long term I think the council are going to benefit very much so from the construction they 've put up out there God knows who 's going to pay for it doesn 't higher that 's about all i have to say but once you thank you very much I honor this very much thank yeah yeah _"

didn 't remember the gaming it was it wasn 't very politically Creek so stop it right now I would like to move on to item 27 crash it City Council 's submission on the draft regional Land Transport plan and just to get the smoothing could we have somebody to move and second the report and its land transport some full clear water moving and Ellie Jones seconding but councillor Turner has an amendment yep it was attached yeah it was attached to the paper you 're joking how did that happen oh ok ok ok we 'll take that on board sorry about that people in a position to sign it off though because otherwise we 'll come back to it you just seeking to that so when does it have to be submitted by look ok can I can I just can I just say that committee for signing off and we 'll just delegate the sign off to you ok it 'll probably can be called at short notice and the environment no I 'd rather that I rather that it would go to it because there was a decision made by the submissions panel to refer it back to Council for sign off and I would write so right so yep no I 'd rather I 'd rather it go to the committee into the committee so the counselors that aren 't on the committee if I could just finish so the counts as a aren 't on that committee I have no way to put amendments or move motions the committee will have seen it twice which seems silly because they 've already seen at once it 's the counselors that haven 't had a chance to say it because of the agenda so have you got have you got amendments that you want to make well operate a few questions were staff and if there was more time I would want to look at some more considered amendments but but I mean this reason and we extended to all cancers so that they could come if they were available which all right because it yeah so and if we could have I mean I look it 's neither here nor there I mean of that you know that the committee meetings don 't clash I mean I 've got no problem that that it could be referred to the to the committee and that any council of that attends his has speaking and voting rights I mean I 'm actually do that as I extend it we 've tried to do that previously and we 've been advised that we 're unable to do that where it goes he can delegate to a group of counselors who would like to be the sign off on this particular one I mean maybe we could just delegate it to a group of counselors okay full david le and yanni and Rafe right Phil David hey I 'm just got no whip whip whip okay so so don 't do people excuse me excuse me order do people want to have a quick discussion and to delegate it to those four people to sign it off and send it yep okay well we do a bit of a round-robin fees to am but blitz time limit this to something so brief I 'll be very very quick so a paragraph three point two point three around peak oil so I really want to know what people means any one speaker who wrote this thing and we need the transport network to be resilient against peak oil prices I mean what does that mean and and this is also to ensure that as all prices increase people still able to have good access to goods or service I mean that 's just that 's there 's no evidence for that all prices are all time low 's about the last ten years so I think that 's a bit woefully the second thing is there 's no mention of rail or train transporting this whole report which is scary and yeah so those are just the two which pilot work what was the second point where there 's no mention of train or rail yeah yeah I agree and so all right so you might driverless cars and you know know the little to mount herbert issue is there by way of amendment and we we I mean I think that we can we just agree that that issue get included and the submission when it goes to those to that group yeah alright so it David to point to point to the item refers to Fitzgerald avenue and pages rope bridge rebuilds and then it goes on to talk about repairs is there someone here to deal with us yeah so we talk about rebuilds and I 'm just concerned about here we 've got pages wrote at twenty to thirty percent of the NBS em and we 're going to repair it so in terms of the S&S I went yours wrong for starter because neither Fitzgerald air or or pages wrote our proposed to be rebuilt they have both now proposed to be repaired and so the titles erroneous and I 'm concerned that we are considering repairing pages road trips with a twenty to thirty percent of national building standard so I I ask I mean the trouble with doing this is that I don 't understand the legal position of the regional Land Transport plan is against our capital works program I mean I don 't_''_499.819 I don 't understand what what why why is the that 's G or devenu and pages road bridge repairs rather than rebuild and why are they in this paper I don 't_''_512.62 I don 't understand it what 's the concern how does it connect by way of background so in in November we put forward what was the City Council 's capital program draft capital program at that stage because into the regional and transport plan so that 's a document that and provide for the whole of Canterbury it comes from all the council 's within the cancer-free region this goes forward to form the National Land Transport plan which is basically the decision around funding they informs the decision around funding for our future program from NZT at our National Land Transport come so this plan here is basically our submission through the regional committee as an application for consideration that bridges they are currently or they are in the original funding agreement the cost share agreement between crown and CCC which is still at large but we to ensure that we get what do you mean there in the original cost share agreement there not mentioned in the cost share agreement the art of the as part of the program for a quake damage repair those two bridges are part of the funding agreement yeah but they 're not part of the funding agreement that part of the skirt program yeah part of the estimate they were in the original damage estimate yeah that 's right yes but Ezra piers not as rebuilt as needing to be repaired but why is it heated rebuild because I can 't remember what they were oh no no I mean the paragraph says Fitzgerald Avenue on pages Road bridge rebuilds and then the paragraphs refer to repairs will clarify that the heading to point to point to cease rebuild but the paragraph refers to repairs that 's basically we acknowledge that there is further work to do in the assessment those bridges so programs identified that seismic MDS assessment the have a bridge that 's twenty percent of national building standard we start to repair it will probably cost that 'll be like bridge street and cost us more than a repair or rebuild ultimately or certainly in terms of the assessment so we 're the funding that 's being suggested here to go into the our LTP will allow for a project in 23 years time that one more look at both those bridges in terms of a full assessment as to whether they can be repaired or require complete rebuild but that at this point between those two is not known because there 's more assessment needed of the abutments more assessment needed of their seismic resistance so yes there is a difference i accepts the difference in the titles there we can we can correct that to be consistent that 's right just to you know do so we 'll just just remove the word rebuilds yeah but what I can 't understand is what is the connection between the scope program and in the regional land transport clean because they 're in the skirt program then they will be when they 're in the regional land transport plan and if we 're asking for this to go on to the regional land transport plan out we agreeing to a lower level of funding you know maybe appoint you to the paragraph to point to the last sentence they are we do have a conundrum because we 've got to discussions going at once one spots in the horizontal infrastructure estimate and what should be funded through the scope program I don 't think we should say the cost share agreement is currently under review it 's not there 's the horizontal infrastructure component of the cost share the first sentence the cost share agreement between counsel and crown the earthquake recovery is currently under review it 's the horizontal infrastructure component of the cost share and it 's called the cost sharing agreement I know I look I don 't want to be sort of not packing but no because I 've never really understood the basis for how do you split between you know what was agreed between plan i know we get less money from the regional down transport plan than we do from the from the h i spin so that 's that I 'm having great difficulty with understanding us it is difficult and the conundrum is we don 't want to preclude we want to keep our options open so what we 're suggesting in this submission and we do need to rephrase 2.2 we 're in discussion discussions that includes these things in the skirt rebuild but if for some reason we do not get funding through there we need to have it listed in the RAL TP so that we qualify for funding we don 't have them in there we 're unable to apply for funding so right that 's correct and the other difficulty we 've got that 's been a year-on-year difficulty the are LTP timing doesn 't align with the LTP so we 're working with a draft LTP the second thing is the conundrum between the discussions and horizontal infrastructure the visa V this plan and the timing doesn 't align so we I think that that that some in a row should be in there shouldn 't up it 's not part of them is that in there on the horizontal in factories devote the moment but it 's a hundred percent funded by counsel at the stage isn 't it some warlord or is it been agreed to now some of the writers is part of it oh good the thing is is that i almost think that what this needs as it needs a section that says that you know we have this cost sharing agreement with the government it is subject to an under pennant review at the moment these are their projects that appear to be you know that are the focus of the review if they are not included within the scope funding model then they need to be included within the regional Land Transport plan and and they are these and and and I think you almost need to just list them all so that they 're in there but I mean do you have to do you have to present them like this or we have to present what are in so you know that and that 's fine i mean the titles are fine it 's just how how you frame it because I mean we 're having a conversation with central government as a result of the independent review so the independent review doesn 't resolve the problem afterwards we have to then have a conversation with central government so I think that I mean I don 't know does it actually say that the independent review will report and march and that there will be discussions following that no we agree with how you have described it right we were trying to write it like that but obviously it hasn 't hit the mark so we will rewrite it a bit more clearly okay ya ali concerned about this from the outset which is why i looked at the prices changing what i suggested initially let 's actually come back to Council and it was going to on my suggestion come back to counsel at the informal on the Monday just gone and I felt that that would have been the time that these things could entire thing to us I wish we had done there actually now and I know there 's no point in going back but it 's one thing to have confidence in communities and panels that are looking at these but this is a major major piece work and it also makes into a whole lot of other stuff as well like rail like the cost sharing agreements for anyone here monday so i don 't know how we if you are happy to do this but i do think it almost needs to be workshopped because it 's still not hitting the nail on the head where I think it should as far as getting across some of the issues i 'm also concerned that we appear to be hedging our bets you know i know it we legally have to absolutely yeah we do we do have evidence i 'm in the message that we 've gotten is that if we don 't get it all in a year and we miss out somewhere I so I look I I just think that what we need to do is I don 't normally do but here we go monday so here we got time have we got anything she George we 've got briefing on that we 've got anything after eleven o 'clock on monday so so eleven o 'clock next monday would you be able to have have it back and a form that we could we could add the informal and then but still delegate to the group because they 're going to have to report back before the next they 're going to have to submit before the next committee I don 't think it 's necessary I minutes if you get what everyone wants but I think you can rewrite the sections of the skirt work quite quickly I mean it 's just a question of doing an overarching paragraph and then the list of the projects you don 't need to change your appendix which you 're saying that you have to legally put it in their form then that 's fine i 've got no problems with their it 's just that it 's just to make sure that it 's clear might have to have conversations with those you understand yeah so a people quite comfortable with that so we can have a discussion at the informal about any issues that people want to have reflected in there and then will delegate it but we 'll move a resolution to delegate the decision making to the smaller group yani the thing that 's missing for me is what is the current agreed horizontal infrastructure repairs and rebuilds so is it just a sorry what is there a sheet like this that shows what 's currently in the horizontal infrastructure repair program so that we can go through and actually see what might you know the page is road bridge what 's the current status because I this arm still unclear what projects they 've actually been agreed of the optimization this is what what we 've got no I think I 'm a choppy well as if we 're putting in one set aren 't on that list or ones that are on it last and for what quantum we probably want to know I mean it 's pretty important yeah that that are really the subject of dispute with the horizontal infrastructure we 're quite confident these the key priority issues so the one around second coat seals and the resurfacing of the CBD these two bridges and and and obviously the cost inflation adjustment which is purely part of the LTP process and that may sound then the other issue is around the scope work currently is not included in there which is whether administrative or not I don 't know but we believe the payment the nzta payments to skirt should be included in this program they 're the four key issues that we 've outlined in the document yeah is there anything that you think that could be missing from the work program or something that 's no internalizing been identified in discussions with with NZTA and so on in terms of the rebuild side of the work the Sumner roads and the other things that have been mentioned this morning with we don 't have any concerns around those well it might be a good idea to have someone from you know that that 's you yeah to the meeting on Monday and and just confirm that that 's the case because I mean I mean we would hate to miss out I mean it is kind of like you 've got to protect yourself either way yep project to do that work and because that 's one of the top congested places in the city now sorry what 's the Morehouse and Fitzgerald I can 't see anything on here that what does the work to be done I 'm intersectional program that 's part of accessible City stuff is that I mean if you can just get me down by one you 're a that was more treasure with heart can you can it can you include that on Mondays briefing yep yep just all right so with someone and can I just make a couple of corrections to that amendment while it 's up there or the next paragraph while it 's up there and that way it 's done if we can just move the full stop at the end of percent to the end of in the foreseeable future on a highway 74 and health effects of increased diesel particulates yeah yeah that 's great thank you very much cool Jimmy also I 'm project whether you can you know clarify in the green bag on the mandate the meeting on page 25 the Abati are due to upgrade because I remember the council annual planned meeting council already secure the kind of 600 k in the 2014 budget to call have faced one the the work but in here I 'm not sure whether phase one already done on a leader or will be initiated from 2015 in the ladle so can you clarify with us but when we mandate nevermind to you know in case you well thank you thank you thank you I fell look can I just briefly say that there 's a lot of really good stuff in the submission and I know that the staff had are really short time trying to write this up the draft actually only came out i think this this year and from when staff were back at work so there 's been a short time fri if there are pulled the isaac for example the fact that cycleways needs to have a much higher priority and certainly the issue around the the extra seal being needed and funding for that and there 's some very big freighters for example an opinion excited but in fact we are asking for i know and i look like i don 't think anyone 's been critical i think that you know we want to present this in a way that you know gets the best possible outcome for us and you know and i think reps raise a good point as well so I mean will look more tidy things up and and it will be fine but so so the people that have moved and Cigna so Phil are you happy to move that the council resolved to delegate authority for sign off and submitting to counselors for clearwater David East le Jones and yanni johansson and resulted over son of incident of the council 's submission put in brackets after submission including councillor tunas amendment I mean that maybe not be the wording that it that it contains but that comment around rail because I 've raised this initially as well and and but it no it needs to inform what what 's going to be rewritten for next Monday because I don 't want to drag this out any more 10 yeah can you come and talk to us about rail because you talked about freight and not necessarily talking about transport and that 's where it became an issue including it in this submission so yeah okay sorry 2.7 under model checked but probably the reason you ever picked it up is because we specifically having used word rail because the more i guess pc word is rapid transit rapid rapid public transport so we 've used rapid transport system so but that could mean light rail rail rapid biology not specify valley and because the work that the UDS is doing is really mode agnostic because there 's a desire to not preclude the conclusion of the studies that were being done the studies could this studies could be that in 20 years we need to put in a rapid bus lane and then on some corridors at the moment we don 't actually know what modes are the best thing for the city so that 's why we 're using sort of a a general term but but how can we can we can we just put on and break heads which may include rail so I 'm going to just just so that it 's clear to the public that what we 're asking for you know because that workers on going there was you know I guess it was disappointing that the that the immediate solution to the Y moment christchurch interface was not rail but we certainly haven 't taken the consideration of rail off the agenda tool and that workers continue it has been researched so you know and i have this kind of dream thing of Ashburton literally well I think breath put it really well in that article you know half an hour away on train I mean it makes it a really viable proposition to live an ashburton and work in christchurch road the amount of stuff that 's being moved do you know no i agree with that our railway system that for example oakland does so they had to double rail in order to make sure that they had a record transport system a rapid transit system rather and at the same time as having good access to freight freight rail yeah _"

    "text": "I 'm proposed governance and organizational support for transition you 'll see that the papers been substantially reworked so to avoid the setting it up as a formal committee but just to reinforce the the governance working group that that exists at the moment we thought it was important to bring a paper back so that it was very public the process that we were using but there is no delegation of decision-making at all so all of the decisions come back here to counsel and and actually with the timeframe that we 've got we can call counsel together very quickly if we need to to make decisions it is going to be a tight time frame because if you consider the transitional arrangements that we 're entering unto the recovery strategy had a an ambitious target of a transition plan to be in place by April 2015 and of course with the number of changes that have occurred over recent times I think that 's a challenging time frame but certainly the the transitional board that that i 'm a member of it certainly is very focused on development of such a transition and of course the council itself is going to have to be very alert and prepared for taking back some of the core functions of the council over a period of time because i think that i don 't think that there 's going to be a waiting period you know let 's wait till april 2016 and then just hand things out to other things i think there 's going to be a gradual move of various functions back into the organizational architecture that supports them over the next year and possibly longer so it 's very important that we have people focused on transition and the chief executive is establishing a transition team to focus resources on this key work program and I think that 's very positive and for us to be able to use the governance working group that we 've already established with the chairs of our committees Mia deputy mayor and finance spokes piece and I think that that 's a good team to be working together with with the management of the organization as we look at both I mean I feel that this is a moved on from where we were last time that we brought the paper here and and possibly ahead of you that we would have to make decisions quickly but actually we don 't we really we really need to be providing the organization with a steer and through our committees and through our various networks around the council table we can get that import of everyone and to what that might look like so I would like to move the staff recommendation do I have a seconder for that Paul lonsdale yep with regard to the workload that this could actually Intel for some of the people will be on that panel it does have a small concern of mine that there is kind of place extra glow dance and these people and other sort of raise it as a as a potential issue yeah I don 't think that there 's no I mean you know people people would put their hands up for the for the effort for the work that it 's going to entail but as I say I think you know it 's not a question of others not having input it 's a question of having a very quick turnaround just for a steer in terms of direction because you 've got officials working with officials you 've got the you know the governance of various organizations working with the governance of organizations you 've got the transition advisory board providing a separate stream of advice we will be consulted as a council on the transitional arrangements as well and it 's quite separate from the advice that 's being sought from the transition advisory board so I just think it 's a good way of making sure that we 're on top of all of the issues and I 'm really supportive of having a transition team that the reporting directly to the chief executive Glen just if I may make a comment and I do want to be positive I I support the people there you know no question and you as my colleagues I just if it 's not at this point I would like some kind of recognition of the for return the community with confidence and some we respects we went through the fires of hell the previous council but we did actually survive and I think we bring experience and institutional knowledge so I think at some point if it 's not this group with some other we have a very keen interest and present transitioning back to full kind of sovereignty in the city so yeah but it as I said look I support people on there is no I don 't have an issue with those there but you know from time to time i do question those who aren 't here and some of these key Thank You Danny are they going to be minutes and agendas available because one of the things I 've found frustrating is that a pressure that the group 's giving direction but I think it 's important that we know what the content of meetings are so that if we 're not on that group and we 've got things we want raised and discussed then we have an opportunity to do that before millions of ministers or whoever takes place clear reporting back framework and it 's not just a reporting framework there 's no clear way in which this group gets direction from the wider collective of council so it will live in me well five point one point three requires management provide counsel with regular updates on progress around the transition program and that final decisions been made by the full council yeah I 'm not this regular updates in opposition see but I would expect that the agendas should be available to all counselors in a minute should be made available as well these aren 't minocin meeting these are formal meetings or counsel or something yeah well notes can be made available of course I can energy yeah it 's important for management as as we work through these processes at different levels of the organization just to make sure that we are on the right track that if there are issues we know what to bring back and and how to deal with some issues that might come up so it 's really for us an organized really a group just to provide a steer that we would have regular updates and we could do a you know weekly update of what 's going on across the organization and some of the decisions that might need to be made as well as for more reporting back to the council on a regular basis if I give you an example e tangible example like terms of reference for an external party to come in and review council companies is that a report that comes to counsel or does this group just give direction or motion the reference oh well sorry might it might we might talk to the group about is there something that we need to do about formal terms of reference or to go ahead of this sort of thing and this is what we 're thinking is that we is that the right direction as opposed to actually saying our signing off on terms of reference or anything like that that would then come to the council so okay and what 's the process for us who aren 't on that group to raise issues around the direction that things are going in directly with me is leading the transition team we need to have all that input and the way that you do now but it 's not it 's not really working now that 's my point Joey Thank You mayor two crashes Oh he 'd get his hand up it ok first one is I support this one in principle however I 'm concerned because as a counselor all your in functions not only for decision making but also providing otherwise or guidance and direction etc but in here i 'm not sure what kind of channel for other counselors because years mayor Debra may and afford counsel but still have more than half a counselor 's you know i 'm not sure which channel this counselor have an opportunity to provide a device and strategic direction to nice the new transitional team second equation is a was a criteria to distinguish what handle issue is to be under in order these items otherwise or direction of a kind of issue has to be made in a full council meeting I revealer confused so whether co can reply to me moment I have a number of informal conversations if something 's come up and to get some sort of direction or thinking is my thinking right for the organization and so what this does is just find a place for that on a regular basis to be able to make sure that we 're on the right track but the formal processes are continued so it will be my responsibilities to keep the council the full council briefed on issues and any decisions and to discuss some of the directions as well so that will happen this is really on a if you like a daily or weekly basis to actually make sure that things are continuing to flow and that we don 't get stuck in areas without some sort of direction and guidance all in this is Don the fight for 1.3 and Carlene thank you you cities and weekly update so perhaps because what regular for weekly no reading yep Andrew I certainly take the concerns that have been raised by councillors and I think communication is absolutely the the key to this so whilst there 's and I welcome that and whilst all the decisions and now you know the substantive decisions have to be made by counsel I think there 's definitely a responsibility on the part of the members of this working group to communicate with the wider group of councillors just as there 's a responsibility on the wider group of councillors to be communicating any concerns to the people on that group as well the inputs and the outputs are important so in as much as it 's good to have that weekly update it 's also important for those that are on that working group to have the concerns of councillors to take to that meeting or to have a good feel for where people are at so that we can bring that into the discussion at those meetings nimbleness and the ability to work quickly is the key but I think more important than that is is that two-way conversation with the whole group in terms of not only the outputs not only reporting what 's happened after the event but the input where possible but able to circulate those so that all councillors can have some input into that discussion and we certainly have a responsibility to take all of those all of those concerns and issues to that table Jamie yeah Jamie look I was just gonna say with us I think we should really get on with this isn 't a conspiracy to take over the world I always talk about governance and management but in that transition there is it 's live over there time so just in a situation like this I actually just surprised that it 's here because it 's really just saying they can provide a bit of guidance you 've got the chairs of the committee 's it 's a small group that chair it that is reflective of the committee that 's made up there and then revs effectively abdicated as chair audit and risk so we could have an independent beer with a outside experience but it 's also the finance spokesperson so I think it 's appropriate their mayor and deputy mere I think there 's going to be a pretty good representation by and large look I 'm on defiance Committee on order and rest on the community one the last thing I want us to be on another committee or anything because I work hard with all the things that i do do for the ones that are appeared to go in there and articulate the views to help us move forward great but in all honesty you we 're even lucky that it 's even here that 's it because you could have this informal chat anyway and it could have just gone ahead it 's been open its being transparent and said hey this is what we 're planning on doing so we can move forward in a positive way and now we end up with this lemon liquorice allsorts thing we 're because from a good gesture to be very transparent about having informal dialogue we then end up with all these things add it to at least up having minutes and coming back with weekly update sniffing Tyler undoes the entire purpose of this so this is just this is a moment where I sit here which is the pet hate account horse by committing ending up with the camel the entire purpose of this is now slightly being lost and at the beginning I actually totally understand why it was being done on it makes sense so I was happy with the recommendation that was there well that can I just comment on that because I think that that 's a really good point and that is that Colleen and I have had a conversation about about the nature of developing reporting back to Council so when you say provides the council with weekly updates the council doesn 't meet weekly the Council meets fortnightly so I think it 's actually quite important that we think about whether we 're asking for a formal report back or an informal report back and in a way the regular updates was designed to create the sense of informality with the capacity to bring for formality decisions that had to be made unto this arena the the reason that it 's here as a paper is that it was originally on the agenda as a with delegated powers and a subcommittee stasek status under etc with the capacity to make decisions on a relatively quick basis the idea was was a degree of nimbleness and a degree of flexibility it is true we didn 't need to bring this back because we can do this without the authority of the council I thought that the a good idea would be to explain what happened to the paper before and why we decided not to go for a full delegated decision-making body but rather to have a governance working group working closely with a transition team that the chief executive is setting up so we 're not asking for permission for the chief executive to do a job that is her job and that 's what we required here to do we have got a process in place that central government essentially controls which is the development of the transition plan we have more than one way of entering into a degree of influence over the way that transition plan is shaped and you know I detect a note of hesitation from some councillors to actually see that as an opportunity which i think is to through our informal meetings just to hit that update and this and talked about communication the whole thing about this and all the questions actually relate to party communication I 've FC no problem does at all because I think this should actually be included air Monday and formal and yeah whether it 's fortnightly or weekly or whatever and notice that all I was saying was that providing the council the council with a capital C is a formal report to the council so I think that you know I mean totally I mean we 've already committed to the weekly reporting on the informal basis so you know I just I just think it 's a shame that but it doesn 't matter we can leave it like this but we could put in formalin you it 's you know I agree with two yes and with weekly informal weekly and formal updates all right we 're going to have to I 'm sorry I 'm going to have to close the meeting because we have to go where I mean there is no room for movement comment on there because nonno I get a little bit frustrated by you know throw away comments this is a private company that has organized an opening to coincide with the presence of the prime minister in town I 'm sure he didn 't look at the council agenda we are not in control of this the fact that he has invited me to speak at that opening is a pleasure and colleagues wanted to attend as well and so I decided to allow for that to occur by a journal Amita so I mean unless people are willing to vote on this now as it is is a it is a one if people were to so to add that we get circulated with the agenda and the noise there isn 't an agenda it 's we 're not talking about a formal process we 're talking about the capacity to meet and discuss matters as they arrive it 's ed hawk it 's like the insurance subcommittee for how many people know it 's hello Mia Mia Mia this leak this just this is like kindergarten let 's a nice light you were hurt Kim no no shh shh shush shush we 'll do it when we come back then right I would have liked to have I would have liked to have done it now but are we able to do it now all right well I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no no what 's it alone and you 'd like that record it Yanni you 're handsome opposed right that 's carried and June the meeting and we 'll start again at

Livingston and is there anything you want to say about the Martian road might of her Road intersection improvements know that it 's just a straightforward it 's all straight ordered and it 's it 's a good resolution for the open end owners around some be happy with the result that 's great jonnie2 are we putting a traffic light yeah yes it 's already under construction right yeah okay and have you got any concerns about the number of traffic lights in this vicinity I think that they 'd entity can warrants that it 's always been real hot spot for incidents this makes it us and I think it will improve the safety for cyclists end in people entering and exiting very hair road okay passionate mation road is not going to be the main route and to the and to the center of city when the northern arterioles head around we 're spending all this money in cranford straight to ms road and we 've got this huge issue there and then in and so we 're trying to free up the traffic and then on the other corridor that I think is a natural kind of way much people would want to come in we 're putting more traffic light but it won 't be the natural corridor it 's going to be a much less important Road when the northern arterial comes on the northern arterial starts at is that Chinese yeah so I mean it 's just it 's just not going to be an issue David look I can understand councillor Johansson 's concern about proliferation of them traffic lights but there 's really no option for this intersection here and without traffic lights and peak traffic people coming off Murray Hill Road which is a major exit for the parklands tomorrow park and all of those subdivisions traffic banks right back up yep a couple of case and to try and remediating issues around there without traffic lights is nigh on impossible so at qe2 and then again at the bombings and then again at briggs road but it 's I think it 's really unavoidable and the traffic lights are reasonably synchronized right through that stretch so I don 't see any other option and I think it 's a good good measure to support and you know the council might like to reflect on the decision that was made around the Bunnings the home base dude but anyway we won 't go there because it was before our time so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye or there 's a place they know that 's carried and now we come to the issue that i raised with the council oh I think about 10 years ago when I was the member of parliament for this area which is fixing the speed limits outside the alpine view and the limes subdivision so it 's fantastic and I 'm absolutely delighted and actually I would like to move this motion myself but I would like to move the board recommendation would is there a seconder for that David on that no it 's like their issues Oh so how how long would it take to get back well hang on him with us but I asked for 50 kilometers an hour that the sign to be moved 300 meters you know and and that was that was well what may not have been 10 years ago might have been eight years ago the last time that there was a review done and I just missed the review apparently so they said they weren 't going to be doing it again for a while so the the the thing is is that that area has got to be 50k because you 've got you 've got elderly people coming in and out of the retirement village and India and their own cars I mean I 'm not not they 're not incompetent to drive they 're perfectly competent to drive but you 're expecting them to go into now a 60k area that 's just not acceptable it 's not acceptable to have a residential subdivision and a retirement village of all things going into a 60k area it have been moved years ago but now we 've got the opportunity to put in the 50k area outside that those two subdivisions lines and jam and L prime viewing what do you mean to move it so it 's so calculator what do you mean calculator I think you 're going to have to join us at the table sorry sorry any them hey Paul better just start all paul burton road corridor operations manager although she 's in it so the beleaguered opinion it would had recently tells us that when you go about setting a speed limit you have to follow a process and that process basically you go through a calculation and it comes up with a number what 's a calculation the calculation is based on a number of whether these schools in the area the number of access points the classification of the road for example the traffic volumes and that will that will give you a number that the rule says as a speed limit okay that 's that so that 's the default that we would use in setting our speed limits extenuating circumstances of which you 've been describing we then the rule allows the council to go back to nzta and say hey look we realize that this is what the the number of all spit out and but there are some extenuating circumstances can we please have your acceptance of a lower speed limit or a high speed limit as a case may be right we have to provide the justification for doing that now what I 'm saying just hold that thought what I 'm saying is what what you want to move is is seven point one point four right but what I 'm saying is you can 't_''_463.49 do that because it applies to the whole area not just the alpine view subdivision it applies to an area where there is no justification for a 50 kilometer an area you have to resolve if you want of a mind to move to make Alpine view 50 kilometers and our you have to go to the comment there under the note should the recommendation under seven point one point four not be accepted then consideration be given that 's not the recommendations that are before you so can we do that that would be lawful and as yourself would have bit more would be more comfortable going to nzta with justification to do that okay so well I 'm happy to change the motion that so seven point one point four go approve that the speed limit on preston 's road be set at 60 kilometres per hour commencing at a point 50 meters east of Martian road and extending an easterly direction to a point how many meters west of alpine view lane well I 'm hoping to I was hoping it over those dimensions really for you but like at this deserve fundamentally remiz these staff recommendation is actually saying 60 kilometers an hour back including the Oasis Grove sorry that the residential old people 's home what we 've been trying what you 've been trying to do for years and one knows what I 'm fixing that no you 're not yes I am I 'm going to extend it in an easterly

    "text": "fixin this morning and there aren 't any parties on this agenda 14 you 'd like to move this your counterpart isn 't here so David East would like to second it there anything you 'd like to draw to our tension Pauline we 're just touching on on page 69 head of deputation from there 's an oven sreesanth 's Association on the cranford Street four-laning and you know they 've brought concerns about the planning what what the community is saying is that that 's been presented in pieces so we 're looking at now the the the link goes across the Atlanta cesis the council mojang not the NZTA one north of qe2 so the link comes across the wheat land and it comes down cranford street as far as an asst road from the ER on the communities being presented with no planning and the assumption is that the modeling is showing that some of the traffic will peel off before it has been a year there could be a lot of congestion a lot of backlog terrifically they have consumed so we 're trying to a holistic approach to that traffic planning south of anas road where it 's going to go from four lanes 22 so there 's a lot of concern of the community about that so we 're trying to work with them to try and get some better modeling we are you are you organizing a sort of a community forum on that with staff to you know with maps and and because I 've seen a presentation which shows that and similar areas you know that peeling effect does occur you know so it would be good to good to you know sort of have one of those public forums they 've had them as far south as an asst road yes Ben there 's been no maps and no plan presented south of an us whether consumers yeah so the the information isn 't the to present to the residents when I said it was kind of the comparable areas you know like going down Martian road people peel off they peel off at Hills Road they peel off it you know like so you 're peeling of here then at the end to be given to the community but yeah that 's also consumed because in an area like cranford Street you 've got an asteroid that might take some peeling but probably only to the west and it 's already congested yeah and then the rest of the peeling could invoke Brett running so it 's it 's got some some weak points that the community is really concerned about so I mean I 'm all for you know sort of information that 's that 's really accessible to people so that they can actually challenger and questioned that and you know poke around on us because there was a lot of expertise and knowledge that sits behind a lot of the decisions that are made I mean I 'm not entirely happy with them you know having to prioritize the that you know North quite related if it 's really at this stage but you know so we have called for that their information and I mean it was an unfortunate use of phrase calling for the project works south of earnest and the community has project and we don 't we 're actually calling for the staff to present us a holistic plan and like you say cuisine the limits and everything to the cam well it does seem odd that it ends up in a place where a center natural entrance to the setting that that was my view you know it ends at Bailey Avenue yeah so at the moment the project is only to ennis road south of there we have work to do so that yep the thirsty up shop alright so well as this is there something that you want added to the resolution that would enable some through the advice to be prepared the community board has already requested that I think we can you can even handle that support perhaps we could support the community board recommendation that information on any plans south of venice road be presented to the community as soon as possible okay so that the report be received and that will noting so port be received comma comma noting that the community board has requested staff to provide a holistic projected mapping of traffic road south of a North Road plan for traffic movement south venice road as part of the northern arterial and cranford Street project extension extension project yes and we want from me as soon as possible as soon as possible how 's that yes it would be good good thank you um Yanni just concerned that their comments were also about the time allowed for submissions and I just wanted to know if the board was doing anything to address those concerns we haven 't_''_337.0 I mean they expressed concern about the timeline after the submissions closed so there was not very much that we could do about that how long the dust emissions open for six weeks standard right but was over the kind of Christmas nearly as Paris me quite a lot of them are unloaded it period yeah okay is done the other thing I just wanted we should probably put a days I 'm just my fault we 've got a lot of requests for a pause come back as soon as poss proper having a date is probably quite useful I don 't know the charge of this process that we 're just reinforcing that plays it well except they 're not because they rely on staff to report back and one of the things that have occurred also as that community boards are you know sometimes waiting quite a while to get these things back so I do any we haven 't had a request from this Community Board for that they said they 're in charge of the process we simply wanted to reinforce I mean they are going down this track normally I would like a date too but we would need staff here to get us on that because I don 't know how much we 've done any on the south so we can 't really put a date on it but we will keep an eye on it through the community and the community board will come back to us if they need I mean you 're getting the message from us that we 're very supportive as a council to support community forward and what it 's doing Paul just just in relation to that holistic view on section without the whole view and I think it 's really important that we actually do get a rare communities a wider view because they are quite interested and see how the impact flows on down down the path so I slept with your that motion that 's good it 's great all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye

    "text": "okay alright well look I think we 'll just proceed with the questions at this stage but it may well be that we need to ask the the committee to actually provide an assessment of the total order and bring it back for final confirmation but you know I really don 't want to hold up these for that their core critical to the network and it just shows that we 've got so much more work to do but you know we want to build on the momentum that 's already been started this huge public desire for these cycles and cycleways and what we know is that people will change the amount of transport if they 're safe and secure cyber ways for them to write on we know that will happen and I might be one of them so I just want to ask a question relation to Rapa Nui share crock and where I 'm coming from is in terms of us not being delayed because the submitter this morning from the committee board referred to the park which would take it cycleway was going to though is that what didn 't what wasn 't clear is it in fact the staff recommendation the Eric banks who wrote the report also recommended that the start that the staff option was in fact workable and the right one I just want their clarifying that 's that 's that 's correct we we had a an options report we were asked to look at our through the option which we did and we put into the matrix and we went back and talked to that community board about that and showed the the results of our assessment and the advice that we 've received regarding ecology etc etc thanks John Kennedy 's also further clarify to that when we 're referring to reports going to community board in fact if a community board is a board said look we 'd like another option to be considered that in fact the staff would give that full consideration and that 's what we did on revenue tree okay thank you yeah now I 've got clean Pauline with you did you hit your hand up your fine and okay so good prices this is probably more democracy services question it 's about that six month time frame which is largely in their hands as elected members but and you see some efficiencies Peter where we can drop right back on that six-month consultation and approval timeframe is it 's much longer than the actual construction and delivery well it can be done in parallel counter yeah we do it contiguous you can do a lot of design work preliminary while the while the consultations going on you think it 's well I think this that 's an hour hence the legal requirement as is pretty clear that so many weeks has got to be in the public arena yeah something no no well it but it 's going through the ltp as well that 's right yeah although we may have to review the timetable for some of them but yeah but we 've got a bit of work to do in a very short space of time ref look I still haven 't really had an answer to this question when the original budget was approved by the previous 's say less than rigorous numbers or did they believe that that would be the full cost and i think what i said was obviously the staff didn 't make it clear to them that it was rough order of course the previous councillors concur with that yes I can 't remember that it was said it was rough water costs it was turned around very quickly wasn 't it yeah my viewers it did have a political context that 's all I 'm so bad using because I 'm just you know to follow up a little clearly that came up at the beginning of 2014 yeah in the annual plant and there was a lot of talk about the cycleways being delayed yep why was it not brought up then I 'm house understanding I can 't answer that question and we haven 't had an answer it 's not that 's not right actually that because the submissions that people made were about the timetabling and we were advised that it had nothing to do with the cost it was to do with the timetabling but we the budget but there was not sufficient money on the budget that 's what we 're hearing now but we didn 't find that out until the capital program process or the LTP process which is it 's not a good process I think we 've all learned from this yeah and I think we also if people remember had a professor of finance in from University of Canterbury who came and questioned and the business case for the 68 million and clearly there hadn 't been a business case I 'm still not seeing a business case more than hundred and fifty six million and it 's dave says you know the cost per kilometer is quite high and we 're still not seeing know the business case to support the extra investment and clearly nobody complained with you know separated sideways and would all love them but it 's a you know large amount of money to invest without any supporting evidence and that maybe that 's something that we should add to the recommendations and that is request a business case for the balance but what I off for each of these today I mean how much are we putting on budget for these four routes so can we have the dollars attached to these because it 's going to have to at the end of the day if these are not robust figures then it 's going to have to come back to Council anyway request a business case for the sideway projects it 's going to have to be reported back very soon I mean presumably there 's the works already done it 's just a question of pulling it together it 's 55 million 404 but the current three-year plan has nine million dollars in it allocated to major cycle ways it 's across the 13 routes for this financial year the the final recommendation is to expand or carry on with the fall priority routes that are listed there in the agenda item with developing or carrying on with the process through those four in accordance with the recommendations today out of that budget obviously the the discussion around the next beyond first of July 2015 that comes into the 23 LTP it be the way things that councils have operated before but i think this councils made it quite clear that what we what we need heed as we need to have a proper set of recommendations fully costed and we need to then allocate that money for the budget and that 's what we 're doing in the long-term plan process but it needs to have it needs to have some transparency around it sort of almost independent of the ltp process so that we can I mean the community is going to let us know whether they want this or not and we have to provide them with really good quality information so that they can say to us yes we want the cycleways but no not this version because this is too expensive or they might say to us yes if that 's what it costs then that 's what I want because I 'm not going to use a cycleway unless it 's actually secure for me to use and given the the target group and you know as being the what was that the the keen but it 's yeah maybe we maybe that 's the the decision that people will make I mean Christ Church is a flex it II we 've got this opportunity to build cycleways an opportunity that we haven 't had as good an opportunity ever before in our entire history well since cars arrived and so this is our chance to do it but there is a cost attached and we put it be really transparent about that and and show people how it 's made up we need to look at ways of reducing those costs and we look need to look at ways you know but um well of engaging people on this and this process of which I think we 've done reasonably well up until now but I think we 've just been slightly let down by the by the timetabling of the increase in costs and letting us know and even letting the previous council know and sufficient time for their putting money on the budget and the first three year plan Jamie you were around in those days for my son 's just wandering around of course just with the with the business case is that envisaged that that would contain our yeast possibilities around deferral for some just like a range of options the reason I say there is because if you look at there will be some some routes that are more compelling than others purely if you 're looking at from a numbers or here usage basis and almost wonder then of you there 's always multiple ways to skin a cat but you know if if some of the things aren 't stacking up to do you know things in one fell swoop that potentially looking at others to say well actually the business case is more attractive or more viable for the City Council if we say acquired the corridors for some but then and then leased them back to someone who could have a better use for that land and the interim and but however in 12 years time will complete that is that the sort thing that business face whatever would it be more of a desktop it 's a size and delving into that sort of detail we would have to look at obviously a business case would look at the options but we 've need to complete the route option study to be able to do that complete the pricing to the full cost estimate to be able to inform that business case and we also i guess in terms of leaving some sections out then we wouldn 't achieve the objective of that connected network all the way through i think that the trouble with it with the answer is that we 've got we 've inherited a commitment to the cycleway network we were asked and now annual planning process not to increase the amount on budget but to defer that i mean take take longer time to to deliver the project so from five years out to eight years that caused the majority of the submissions to the Council on the annual plan so I mean in the face of the fact that it that it didn 't make a jot of difference to the annual plan because the annual plan wasn 't five years out it was only the one year of difference to it so we said well if it 's got nothing to do with money will bring it in somebody should have said excuse me it 's going to cost a lot more money and we need to do some more work on there because we need to bring a paper to you as a new council to confirm that you 're still willing to proceed given the additional costs now that requires a business case we 're talking a hundred and sixty of million dollars that is not a small amount of money there is no way that this council is going to spend a hundred and sixty million dollars without a business case I mean you wouldn 't expect it is it because their individual cycleways that nobody seeing the big picture this is a network that we are developing here it is a substantial sum of money and to be responsible as a council we need to see the business case and I 'm thinking that it 's not going to take very long to put together because you must have all of the information essentially all together in a business case is that not clear I think we 've certain that yes yeah and the financial implications are expectations as that will consider this as part of the 2015 LTP we 're asking for now as to work within the budget we 've got to keep going on the consultation fees with these four roots and bring it back to the infrastructure committee for sign off so you wouldn 't be signing off building you wouldn 't be signing off the the dollar slain you just keeping the process gone oh hang on that 's not what it sees it sees some well with into the recommendation so that we 're referring the final decision to the infrastructure transport Environment Committee for route selection so that means that we 're assuming that we 're going ahead with the whole program that 's what that 's what bothers me we actually I mean look I want these to go ahead they are the top priorities unicycle and puppy no parallel our absolute core critical I mean as I 've said I don 't know the other like the spines and the network so I just you know and and and maybe rubber noise shag rock you know meets that criteria as well and climbers trail to the south and to the city so you know I mean maybe these are the four the four elements of the network that are cool critical to the whole network being developed but we need the network decision brought to us as a separate paper with with the full costings so that we can sign off on there it will be in the LTP but if if you think that we would go if we can just go the financial implications are to be considered as part of the 2015 long-term plan and it 's just putting it on the budget for the capital works program with no decision of the council you know with a proper paper with all of the you know regulatory impact analysis done and a business case then that 's we couldn 't spend a hundred and sixty million dollars without that rigor that that 's all we 're asking for is financial rigor Vicky the time of the annual plan last time was people saying please build these sucka ways yep as I said we 're getting on with four and Tim 's give the planning and we 've started them anywhere I mean parts of them are actually starting to happen so we need to build those we know that they stick up interestingly we never looked like the Summoner road what is it Dave 110 million one road very little my favorite like it 's about a 19 million we did a flyover the other day that what I think was about 30 million we did a sewage thing and necro that 's about 80 million we spend these sorts of money all the time actually and because the cycles it 's getting actually far more scrutiny than it would if it was cars and we have as a prioritized system in for the council when we had it the other day the fact that number one is pedestrians and that 's what we spin in a lot of money on central city number two as cyclists number three is public transport private cars because unless you prioritize your roads this that way your roads simply do not work or your transport infrastructure simply does not work for any user so if you prioritize cars as we have for a very long time you clog up the roads and doesn 't work for pedestrians it doesn 't work for cyclists doesn 't work for public transport and doesn 't work for freight so we know that we are going to do a modal shift and it is one of the exciting elements that the City Council is actually going to do it so as I see it we now have a targeted rate in place we 're about to get an announcement for means ETA have increased funding for major urban cycleways yep which is good we 're going to apply to NC ETA for as much subsidies weekend and since we 'll be in the best place of any council to apply for it we 'll grab all of the money that 's available from the government for increased urban sites or nose or as much as possible anyway but we there is a question here no no I thought we run debate no oh sorry I 'll stop me oh well I don 't know it oh okay all right well Carrie I 'm sorry sorry so the the important thing is that we have four routes that we know are really important we 've done the priority we 've done a huge amount of work we 're negotiating with groups like the university to get access across the fields we 've been negotiating with records and bush trustees to get access across there let 's just get on and do at least these four if the entire population says at the time of the annual plan or a huge percentage of population seas are no don 't do cycleways which I certainly don 't expect but if that happens then we have done these four from the current allocation of budget which is currently 68 million on the long-term plan and it will be difficult to do many more I don 't expect that I expect that people will say actually we are willing to pay more I whether want cycleways we want to feel safe and those of us who are not game to cycle down wicket and road or any other the road because there 's a car right by you or a bus or a bus or a truck even worse want separated cycleways and we are willing to change its large numbers of us are willing to change as we know from the research willing to change our mode of transport if cycling is safe what we 're doing here is getting on with the four key ones this has been a really long slow process yes I know there 's a process that we still have to go through but we just need to get on out and delegate to the Environment Committee infrastructure and transport what is there called the fact that they can get on and actually make some cycleways happen in the city will Pauline had a question so I 'll just give you a question first thank you I was just about your um NZTA any moti subsidies that you put in the table of costings and I was just cited there it I don 't know twenty twenty-five percent until you see is it if you put a potential so how do you arrive at that kind of figure the twenty-five percent is used for the whole roading capital program in terms of NZ ta across it because only about certain elements of the roading program it 's delivered each year a fundable for those elements that there are the compliant NZ DA 's funding criteria and are approved by them we get forty-eight percent so the twenty-five percent is a broad pro Everage across the whole program there 's an expectation of what total funding we 're predicting we will receive from NZTA under there normal funding process the MOT funding is a is a separate fund that is being established by government there 's indications that are looking of that as a separate from from the normal NZTA this mot one the hundred million for urban cycleways across new zealand was it the fund which one okay so the the NZ ta ta potential subsidy figures would seem to me to be feeling it curat your pet whole roading program and that 's just the application on it to the cycleway thank you it 's helpful thank you and at Paul are there any other questions Yanni I want to be really clear how much money do we have currently on budget for cycleways and how much money have we spent some accounts were made that so I decision I can 't how 's the second part of the question so don 't have the information with me to dive in terms of that this current financial year there 's just under nine billion dollars in the three year plan for financial year 14 that are for that across the 13 roots because the figures the figures i have is that this year we 're supposed to have dueting when 5 million on budget and 7 million was within 13 14 and we 've only spent about six million but obviously that may have changed through last year 's annual and that was when the council of the unaltered a three year plan but I 'm just trying to understand how much difference the dutiful roots are the current budget is a person multi-year is the portal that each of the projects is split over a number of years so the sum total of all 13 for this financial year that we 're currently in is just under 9 million dollars right and what was it last year what 's the total if you look at it if you think about we had two years and there 's been a number of allocated towards the major cycleways over those two years I 'm just understand what that total has been because obviously this year first of July we 'll all have a different budget and then my understands which have been about 6 million oh sorry we 've collected about 6 million from the 20 or even you and we spent about 3 million dollars on design that we don 't have the numbers to hand for last apparently for last year or the previous year but a lot of the sheep velocity is its design and you know that sort of thing so they 're not it 's not money that 's going into digging up done on they did in the expenditure today has been on undertaking some survey work yes some root prioritization work and some consultation work and various parts of that the reports there have been designed to a greater level of detail but there has been no physical work undertaken on any cycle wage to date I think the note James sent around the fourth in sixty eight point eight million over five years as the current bad jack we don 't actually have a budget after we 're going to get a three-year an order to plan so anything that goes on beyond the runner years as an itchy or budget no so in the three then we currently have my estamos that we 've had about twenty we had about just for the three years close to twenty nine million or budget for the cycleways right so the difficulty is is that we are looking at this across multiple years I mean they 're not all gonna that all the money doesn 't come in one year in terms of all of the different stages of the development of of the one of the problems in terms of what 's been missing from our ability as a council to get that that that global view of the cycleway network so maybe this last seven point 10 if we could turn that into request the chief executive to provide a report to Council so I 'll get it to come directly back to council since and unless I don 't think it needs to go to your committee on the complete costings for each component of the major cycleway route program you know it 's to actually see the total picture so does the components within each of the roots so that we 're getting there oh and then and then we 'll have a total from of the program along he Bruce costumes without the subsidies could be very misleading I mean do we give you okay it 's fine I don 't know right Elise than it is where was along with any potential contributions from in CDA and mot is it in full stop this report is to contain a regulatory impact analysis to support the business with respect we got into trouble before through doing committing to do something in a timeframe we couldn 't deliver so I 'm just going to ask my team to tell us what we could deliver in that time frame what would be that the LTP is being signed off on the thirtieth of June so is that not possible to do that continues to have a detailed costing for every single route in every section of single of the roots will would require us to have taken the designs for all 13 routes to to the point where we could give a detailed cost in we have done that for sections of the first five routes and we can certainly bring back a report on the basis of that to show how the numbers that are contained on on the okay the addition today are built up in more detail and how how we 've arrived at those estimates based on the current and I guidelines but they provide a report to Council on the estimates on the current estimates for the first for each route but the boss along with any potential contributions from nzta and mot this reporters to can 't contain a rigger to impede analysis to support the business case to assist councils consideration of the two thousand fifteen to twenty-five LTV not yes yep alright so now Paul you had another amendment I just want to thank staff on over this is a huge report and a lot of words got into it a night and I think this council as you said really and that we are really supportive of this major slightly program the what the amendment I 'd like to make as the agree to their major cycle way route programs being declared a metropolitan program which is correct but the decision-making power remember the full council now I just want to say why that is is that you 've heard today here the amount of concerns around the table a rabbit about this program and the amount of money that we are having to invest in this program and I think there needs to be retained that that ownership by the full council because you 've got in the aight represented on that committee and i have concerns around you know the committee taking care of the concern the from the public around loss of parking and and I think the sesh year at ified in a major way is that there will be loss of park and we know that and we accept that how we have often this loss of parking affects those small leak communities and young I 've been dealing with the issues and rip clips directly around the seal I mean was we have to accept it as going to gloss parking here but these are at the expense of the these major key activity centers who build major car parks on their plot and and they kill off these weak small communities in these small areas and to me as a community board representative for the heck de Faria made the council to the habit of here and meet board I want to be dealing with that directly with with my constituents oh I don 't want to live in the hands of someone else and I think that 's really important to me I 'll just highlight the concern around that is that the the aight committee and i respect all the work they they do but they bought an item to the council where then we 're going to remove six car parks outside a small shopping area for a cycle weather wasn 't going to take place for ten years now that is a concern i have in my own world that that doesn 't happen so as i said because of the the size of the project because of the the cost of the project and because we are all quite passionate up making sure we deliver a really great project for it for our people of Christchurch I want to be throwing involved as a full council and keep that visibility and the decision-making power we can represent our boards who you know who some of the members on their have concerns and and and quite rightly so and they have ideas and I want to make sure and I stood on the fact that we want to strengthen the power of the community boards and and and and is often the way we do it is as bringing those decisions through our community boards as elected members around this table we are those consumers we debate those concerns and i believe we actually come up with a far stronger outcome and a far better outcome so as I said the amendment I want to make is to agree with all of the first part of 7.4 but sorry to remain the full decision maker okay look I won 't fill to kind of wrap things up so I 'd rather call you at the end if that 's all right so Ellie and thank you I think it 's clear that two of the key components basic components of a safe cycle system is the traffic lights and intersections and that 's where we 're seeing the huge increase in costs but any increase particularly one as substantial as this has got to be questioned and I think that 's what we 've done today it got to be answered and it 's got to be answered robustly and transparently and I think we 're starting to get in the car at the moment at some of the intersections around christchurch we the green paint has gone down but the signalized changes haven 't been implemented just to see how unsafe it as for a cyclist who takes off her head as a cartoons left their cycle thinking they 've got the right of way I 've seen several near accidents near misses in that kind of situation so there is no doubt that we need that degree of safety around our intersections but this is a huge amount of money and it 's a huge amount of money especially at a time where you know we still have hugely broken roads we had broken houses and to be frank how trailers still hugely underutilized in my opinion I support the roots elections today as they are priorities and and I think what 's important is that they can operate effectively outside the wider network and I think that 's really important to consider when you don 't have all of the information around that wider network they can operate as stand-alones I will reconsider my position around have to well we 've now been able to look at those design new designs and the related figures and I think it 's already has been said around the table I support cycling it 's really important in Christchurch and I encourage cycling and it 's not about I don 't agree with councillor mark I don 't think it 's about whether we want cycleways or not it 's actually degrees within the cycleways and reasonableness in the current environment and not to the detriment of cars we do need cars I can 't go to the supermarket on my bike so I think we have to look in the real world here as well and it 's not all or nothing and I think we need to look at a citywide transport strategy I think we need to look very closely a rail and we need to also look at the regulation and the regulatory system around transport and our city hey Tim Pauline I think that some no question that is Safety 's priority our parents our partners and our children are precious and I 'd moment I 'd be very reluctant to see them biking the student places so it 's totally to support the cycleways but I guess what we hear this morning with regards to repin OE if you take an example of brown street it 's the best way to go from a to b four tracks I don 't want to see cycleways treated the same as Rose they I want them to be part of the community and loved by those communities that they travel through probably follow on a wee bit from Paul with regards to those and community shopping centers etc there 's how we 're going to get people to to adopt and love cycling even more than they are now so I would really want to see that involvement the community boards i know we are going to get different opinions at which we heard this morning but we can engineer anything but it 's about putting the patient and those cycleways for those communities that will undoubtedly be affected by those South Wales going through them so I totally support it but I just want these cycleways are fully involved thank you appalling um well I think that when you look at it across the whole project that 's really like we 're creating a whole new roading network for bicycles in personally I think it 's a real bargain and also when you 're throwing to the mixer savings that that will be made through lease injuries excellent excellence and fatalities it 's even more of bargain but bring if i can make it comment about the amendment is that appropriate yep because I support other counselors having them put into the into the project but how about a suggestion to the mover that it stays with the aight committee but councillors can attend was voting rights but they can anyway it 's under our current standing orders that is the case but but I I like Tonya 's voting rights is it was a sucky okay oh that 's right speaking but not voting yeah because it way it would stay in it and the fast trick closest but each counselor would be able to put the view in goat on YouTube yeah even see what was it which is pause but oh I see so I needed it well I haven 't gotten that haven 't got a seconder for Paul 's amendment these are kind of amendments that we 've done together so Paul was happy to to move these and I was happy to seek him both of them and we kind of wanted them considered and you know but put it on separately but we 've we 've been working together on it so there 's just some confusion when we gave them in but it what 's confusing is that depending on I mean I like the second one but the first one just makes defeats the whole purpose because it puts all the time constraints back into the process because it comes back to Council for a final decision yeah I was just trying to process where we get these tournaments put up moved and seconded so we can live debate each one I prefer your one oh my god of different I mean it 's on different part I know that they 're different ones but they 're contradictory both amendments to the cheers recommendations that we 've got in front of us oh there 's a similar point four and a seven point seven so it 's just a mending those two and replacing worth okay yeah but we need a mover and a second up for the original motion but which well I suppose you get a right of reply don 't you at the end of you hey but then but I want to kind of give you the final say though but you do you want to speak now and then I think in terms of it I need a seconder for the motion sorry do the whole motion the whole motion I 'll second it so there you go right but the think in terms of the amendment I think what councillors need to keep in mind is that the people we represent said what we want the cycleways and especially is force for we want them in fast in fact we want them in now and it 's I think our council knows and in fact if ever again an _''_2433.8 themselves that that then makes a difficult say for the committee to the scope within the recommendation is for full involvement by the community philosophy there 's no question there and I guess what it seems to me though is if in fact council what if the rick at the amendment is supported and council want to make this decision so be it but clearly then sometimes these things go backwards and forwards from the committee to counsel and if councillors are voting for their an example is what we had today we 're you know that one member of a community board couldn 't agree on the options which have been recommended this thing will go backwards and forwards often and what I will again point out is that 's not what the community asked us they asked us to get that to have these fast track so just and there 's no doubt that clearly the whole financial implications were well need to become before council and will so I guess it 's over to councillors if we if we want be able to work number Lee and the original recommendation right now Paul I 've got no Tim sori spoken so Pauline did you want to speak to the amendment or to the motions you 've spoken and clean thank you I my view on this as a user and elected repo user cycling yeah there was only a slight pause and in mine he 's a rider tomorrow it 's a cyclist multitask oh that 's right is that we 're already have to be free stuff like the circus and Christchurch and even then you take your life in your hands look I really support this we need a dedicated cycleway system and I think if we deliver this it delivers the vision that the people wanted of the city it clean green city but let 's do it well it can be ready inspiring it can be a real you know it 's real vision casting for the city but we 've got to do it properly and nail down the costs I support pools intent of and Pauline 's of how to have us all involved but I want speed in process so to get this right so those are my main concerns getting the speed in the process and getting those costs nailed down so that we can do this well and really lead the way and I think if we have this dedicated cycle system that will really Marcus out as a city and it will be something good that it comes out of us so let 's get into it with its web easy honey this little computer are we debating the amendment although we 're debating the whole lot to give ok cool so um oh I wonder so I I 'm probably one of the few key counselors that was here when we made that decision to the cycleways I strongly support doing the major cycle ways I think it is absolutely essential and in fact it was councillor Carter and myself who got council to agree to send the christchurch transport plan back before it was approved so that we actually got proper better cycleways in place because we were concerned that the transport there was really relying on freight and cars and not focused enough on this done over three years rather than five to align with the skirt program I thought that that would Gus a lot of opportunity that was nearly two years ago so things have been slower than we would have liked to two years on and we 've got some designs we have carry forward funding every year but we 're now in a position we can go on and get some done which is great I think it 's really important that we recognize these as being metropolitan projects have no issue with that I think it makes sense but we shouldn 't get away from our good democratic processes of using our community boards to engage with their communities and so that 's why I 'm supporting these amendments if you want to have a conversation with a local community about closing what 's the strata fits your dev then I think the community board is the best place to have those conversations daily A 's with the resonance groups on a regular basis they 've been dealing with things like Lattimore square when it got closed previously they over what happens in that area and to not allow that community board to be involved in a significant local decision that impacts significantly on local people like the closure of what 's the street efforts your dev I think is not fair it 's not fair to those people that were elected in community boards don 't necessarily add more time to the process in fact most community boards around the city are quite nimble and meet when they need to me and they can make at short notice they can make additional meetings in time available and in fact they welcome the opportunity to be involved so I think it 's really important that we as a council that got elected on a clear platform of supporting and strengthening our community boards are not seem to be blaming them for the reasons that things aren 't happening but instead provide them with the resources and the opportunity to do what they do best which is liaised with local communities to get good outcomes so I have confidence in our community boards might not agree with everything that they them to actually do the work at their tasks with doing I think it 's really and counselors won 't be surprised but I haven 't enjoyed the way in which we 've delegated things away from the cap collective council I think over major things were we 're spending lots of money and things that are having a metropolitan impact on our city that it 's every counts as right to be involved in those decisions I think you 're elected to represent people and you 're elected to be here and make decisions for the good of the city and I don 't think we should take away the right of any elected member around this table lightly from being involved in making those decisions so I won 't support delegating to the committee I do like the idea that the council can make the final of self and again if the committee had been able to have all the councillors attend I would have preferred that option but we 've heard the legal advice that it can 't_``_2808.069 happen so I support cycleways I think we can as soon as possible and I don 't think we should say that going to counsel or go into a community board delays the process I think in fact that speeds it up and that people see a more robust transparent system of decision-making that is expected under local government to me first I would like to emphasize for this psycho is where we will be the crucial in the important we go forward when expect we 're compliant with the itouch the transport strategy and also to take a candle a tube traveling and have a kind of motor transport mode because you based on the wake is you mentioned earlier you reconsider priority pedestrian walk away psycho with public transport in the cast power cycle a second the priority and also based on the investigation we are all aware currently popular psycho cyclist around the ten percentage however if we fill up these the psycho wave facility no they will have tens your thirty percent people they have a interest and the intention would lie to you know to be a cyclist or there 's a huge the a safety issue is still very very crucial and important so in here we can see that if we follow a dog to the major psycho web design principle based the party 's design guide and also the stuff they mentioned earlier already know probably you pay to the earth the Lisa two years ago last Dustin counselor we actually you know is hurried to the to handle to make decision because all those the information is from the stop-start give us the coaster give us the kind of information no is a weather is on Android only or need to consider of Lord only this way be limited decision however due to this part of the long-term plan tada of any plan so in the restricted limit information we make this kind of we must make the kind of decision however right now stop Eva 's more sufficiently information so we need to face the new information make a proper decision and this is updated this also Papa it attitude I think third one is that the regarding to the priority because in here you with reviewed the page you know already to a kind of our our ties the the drinking for those the 13th cycle the problem roots already because there is a comprehensive methodology we need to recognize their specialist they 're the kind of knowledge you know they 're the kind of specialism strategical feet the high use the potential trevorton durability improving 70 and also the economic support I think that 's very the kind of comprehensive information but but but regarding to the weather is supported Easter and amendment of supporter original my personal is not a another control Dichter or conflict how do we speed up the progress and also consider community portal get involved but in here if we review the 7.6 here had clearly the appropriate affected a communal member involved in the committee no matter the kind of decision or bring to the campo at the council because i know it 's kinda we need consider parents is more faster or is more kind of the class route the consultation essential need to try to know the parents but i think ab 7.6 in here already consider communipaw issue fact pal regarding the party today 's last last one are acquitted you know we have aid on the seven-pointed k you know try to have a further the study regarding to this 88 million dollars less outer attitude so thank you android david i 'll keep its brief but yes strongly supportive of the cycleways and strongly of delivering these cycleways as quickly as we possibly can so that we get the opportunities for modal shift and safety for cyclists as as soon as possible my main concern when i first saw the staff recommendation is set out in the original report on page 139 of the agenda was the ability for the commune he boards to be involved fully in the decision-making process and for that reason I was pleased to see the amended staff recommendation on the separate sheet that was handed out because that actually does address this in a way that I consider to be meaningful it gives the community boards a role they 're both to be involved in discussion and to make a recommendation in each case now the deputation this morning that local knowledge that community board members have but needs to be taken into account in these discussions and we 've heard elsewhere in the debate today that you know obviously community board members will have differing views the opportunity for the boards to make a formal recommendation for the committee allows for that debate to happen around the community board table and for a vote to be taken and a recommendation to be put forward in the usual way so the community boards certainly have the ability to to debate this and to put forward a recommendation to the committing and I 've got every confidence in the committee that they all fully consider the recommendations from the community boards with an open mind and community boards therefore will have a a meaningful part in the process in terms of the delegation to the committee you know I do you look at the report and you see the huge amount of technical knowledge that the committee need to be across in order to make their decisions I 'm aware of the huge amount of work the committee have done already matter to be delegated to the committee for decision making I think it 'll speed up the process and I 've got confidence that they 've digested all of this technical information in a result in a way that term because they 've worked on it they can understand more than a person coming into this late in peace would be able to so yeah I 'm going to vote in favor of the original the recommendation as is put today and I won 't be supporting either of the amendments for the reasons stated today thank you I 'll be even briefer of seven this chamber on numerous occasions where committees have Ben hours and hours and hours on various subjects only to come here and have the whole lot re litigated there is the opportunity for any member to sit on and sit in on any committee they may not have a vote but they certainly have the opportunity to speak and influence the decision I particularly support 7.1 10 on the and the motion where we 're asking for a breakdown of costs so I am still 've SAT here and done a bit of a calculation and they range from 54,000 up to 1.5 million dollars per kilometer so I am very keen to see see the breakdown of how we come to the costs of these various cycleways so I am a big fan of getting these cycleways underway on a huge fan of getting as much of it off road as possible with regard to the timeline I 'm reasonably flexible let 's do it as quickly as possible but we have to be fiscally responsible I would like to see it you know allocated in their budget and a fashion that we 're not biting off more than we can chew so I will be supporting the original motion thank you and I 'm just going to say a couple of weeks before I hand over to fill to wrap it up the major cycleway route program is absolutely vital for the modal shift that we know will come about if we put safe cycleways and our city absolutely clear cut that that will happen I 've met people who work in business work every day they are dealing with the frustrations that are that are there I know that the numbers using their cycles will increase as soon as they can rely on them but it 's not just the individual choice it 's parents having the confidence to put their kids on bicycles to travel to school this has major benefits for the city 's well-being as well you know I mean we all bike to school in the old for goodness sake the point of difference of christchurch is that it 's flat you know that the major parts of the city of flat and we should have easy access it 's true that people have this love affair with their cars but you know most of the roads are going to be fully available to cars and actually just some of the roads are going to have a cycleway as part of their as part of them and i think that that 's really important I reflected on all of the conversations around the who makes the decision and sometimes one of the issues is is that when you is why I 'm actually going to support the second of the amendments if you 're too close to your community sometimes it makes it more difficult to make make a decision that might be controversial at the committee at the local level which is why I think it 's better to bring it back to the to the infrastructure committee to deal with i remember in New York City when the Transport Commissioner promoted a whole lot of cycleways through particularly busy little business districts the businesses were up in arms they said we don 't want cycleway so she put them in for a temporary period 12 months they couldn 't believe how much their business expanded in that period is as people slowed down and saw what was on offer on their places and those little areas that had cafes and various things you know they started to see that their business increasing their return by thirty percent their tent over increased by thirty percent and some of those areas so that 's the sort of thing that we need to be sending out there by way if you only have cycleways which are about getting from A to B then you won 't get that benefit either so it 's got to be a combination of them all which is why i like the network approach the last thing that I want to say is about financial rigor now this is my first time going through an LTP process and it is kind of like never again but what it has highlighted for me is that the separation between the activity management plans and the capital program doesn 't work it 's not financially rigorous you actually need to combine what the organization is doing with the capital requirements of the organization as well and the approach that we 've had to date is not acceptable so i do apologize to the officials at the end of the table have had to hear for the first time that this council isn 't going to accept large capital works without the kind of rigorous analysis to back up good decision-making and to comment on what the deputy mayor said it is true that we spend millions of they 've got to be subject to the same rigor as well when we 're spending large amounts of ratepayers money we actually need to have a very clear understanding of value for money the cost-benefit analysis the business case principles that you would see applied to any large expenditure on a central government basis and actually in the private sector as well so that 's the kind of rigor that I think comes really a message to the chief executive that we 're going to expect from here on Edison separating cycleways from from the rest of the projects it 's actually the cycleways are going to lead the way in terms of the way we want to do to make these decisions in the future and I 'll let Phil just wind it up well besides the geography of Christchurch we 've also got some history and like previous minutes going back to the mid 1950s show that on Colombo street five thousand people a day we 're biking to and back from work so we can regain their I think though the essential thing is that this advantage of putting in cycle is it will take off take off that threshold at that top 50 even if takes of 15 starts with 15 perceived it starts to relieve traffic congestion and we need to get that done that is essential for the city the people are telling us that and no uncertain terms I 'm actually opposing ammendment part because it just seems to me that is very much business as usual I don 't think as a council we 've got time to keep on fiddling while we 've got the sort of congestion the community board chairs have told me in person each one that they were happy to work with the committee and they will be part of the committee okay every board chair has worked as told me that that the staff have taught already talked with the community boards most of the cycleways that the first two anyway are starting to be under way that this very good work already been done and I don 't want that jeopardized by this process being delayed and so and I don 't personally don as chair of this committee but I 'm prepared to take it on and I ask for your support so that in fact we get things done that 's what I was elected for and that 's what I want support from us council to do excellent right so the advice that I 've received is that I need to put 7.4 amendment first because if that is carried then it makes a difference as to who the final decision maker is so i will put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so do we want to show of hands those in favor say put your hands up and the right so that 's yummy Oh Henson poo lonsdale England Livingston and those opposed to put your hands up and that 's everyone else so there is lost so we 'll move to the next amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no all right we can have a division on that so if you could throw that up on the ng golf kata it counts right I think this is the community board before and after consultation for recommendations to come back to the ite but the ite remains the decision maker and so now I 'll put the whole motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously thank you excellent right now i think it is it down to me to move that _"

    "text": "into the report and they get counselor clearwater to talk to those in a minute but i think that there are a number of questions that people have in relation to the cycleways and i 'm just wondering who wants to kind of start that off do you want to start that off field because you 've you 've kind of been receiving a lot of comments from people well I think some clarification from you and thank you for the chart and information you 've you 've added but it 's really around basically if you could crisil or Jane or John if you could press cover perhaps a summary of the summary sheet you 've given us with the charts which show the differences between the original estimates which are in the three year plan currently and the new estimates and and part of that too is some examples of the different of the differences in terms of the standards and oh before I hand over to Chris and John just apologies for the late arrival of this counselors have only just got it in front of them to go through the other elements of the report or just I don 't know and look I be here me I think we cut just for clarity it would be useful to give a summary of the key elements of a report to cos thank you thank you so the purpose of the report today is there 's several several south sub sections to it firstly to give an update on progress with the parts of the network that are currently in progress in terms of working through the route selection and so on and conversations with community boards etc it 's to seek approval of the proposed priorities for the four routes that are identified in the recommendation it 's to seek approval of the proposed decoration of this program as a metropolitan project that is to to basically try and ensure consistency because it is a network issue across the whole of the major cycleway program and that has implications in terms of the delegations and so on that are contained in the recommendation it 's to seek adoption in principle of the design principles best practice used that as a way forward for the the next set of all the routes that are currently being considered by staff and to approve continuing with the program on the bait so this funding in this current free gear plan in this current financial year is to prove continuation under that funding level but for the routes that are recommended and to the new standards that are up for consideration today so if I move first lead to current progress and John can give you a quick update of where we 're at on those forwards so on the unicycle route we 've completed consultation and the detail design is completed for meadow street east which includes past the girls high school but also signals crossing of Dean 's Avenue and some operations to the intersection of Dean 's Pendleton and harbour paranoiac parallel and once again we 've been through consultation on the section through the reserve at grassmere which provides the the cycle base either side of that aren 't formalized yet but they are local roads and it is a connection at the moment not a that will be to our new standards and at the same time on both of those we 're proceeding with the detailed scheme assistance of the wrists of the sections on both of those routes so that 's on the unicycle route that takes us right out past the university we 're talking to University etc there and pepper new parallel is through Colombo each where Trafalgar and it comes out onto main north road at saw his arms so we 're moving ahead with this the detail skimming work on that and as part of the consultation process if council agrees with the delegation today we will provide that information and talk to the effective community boards and then they can provide some feedback to the committee little river so little river link has got two sections to it the first section really is a connection from the central city across more or SF that links into the existing cycle way that was built as part of the crotchet southern motorway first stage so we 've got a section of cycle way that if you like hasn 't got gives us much better usage of that existing facility and NZTA are looking as part of CSM to to extend that site way as part of their works does then a short connection etzel river itself which is very much a recreational route which just enhances the safety for cyclists as they go into the little river village and then revenue share Brock we 're doing some scheme design work on the section between the city and escape so that 's um we 're out there I 'm going into the group prioritization so I 'm on page 27 one of your report there 's a table dear that gives you the basis upon which we 've assessed all of the roots and the criteria and the consequential and prioritization so that 's what Chris was talking about before that those those are the priorities based on the benefits in and you know how they fit strategically travel time reliability of those things there so that was this matrix is a table which staff pondered over put together and then SSD true gangster can I just know in the party the priorities there may be some sections of other routes that are a little further down the priority list but but a short section that delivers a significant benefit and and one of them is on Cory mins trail that it gets us across Morehouse AB and connects to to future routes but it gets us across Orleans trail and across the state highway and in length people into more a local community so we really want to have that flexibility that we there 's a short section that delivers a great benefit let 's and move on and do that so that 's the prioritization on page 135 there 's a bit of information there about the delivery program Morris background to give you an indication of the phases of the project and the likely timing of each of those phases will take us not a really subject to the recommendations today that 's just more by way of background if we move to page 136 on the decision-making responsibilities this is around the declaration or the project as a metropolitan program and thus is considered as a citywide that again is intended to ensure consistency across the whole network the second part of it is that if we follow the recommendation then we do achieve something like a six-week shortening of the time frame for the program on the previous page because we 're able cancel the proposal is to consider any community board input at the meeting of the infrastructure transport Environment Committee by way of involving them in that in that consideration so that 's the Declaration of the the program is a metropolitan project if we then the next major item that we 're considering today is adoption of the design principles best practice guide and this is really the next step from the document have adopted in april 2013 as the high level design philosophy that underpins the major cycle routes it is really a is a more technical document that guides designers in terms of the sort of standards that we want to it that we need to embody in the designs of these these routes to achieve the overall objectives of the design philosophy so that really sets as an appendix to is basically further information its detailed information that guy 's designers in the same way as the infrastructure design standards ensure consistency across a whole range of designers that might be working on infrastructure in the city there is a complication from those and that side move down to the the paper that 's been tabled today in terms of some of the costs the implication of that design guide means that the original estimate that was put together back in december 2012 there is a difference between that and what is the current estimate of providing to those standards that are in that principles best principles guide the original estimate was really based on the standards and specifications that were used by the city council for psycho wales waste prior to 2013 now those standards are a lot higher the pricing that was put together under the original estimate was based on a mix of unit rates for the sort of intersection improvements that were being provided at that time and for the sort of paths pathway widths and on-road facilities that provided at that time and as a to a comparable lower standard than is in the new standard and the original estimates didn 't provide unbroken levels of safe and accessible routes through the whole route so what we 're now trying to achieve is a consistent standard from one end to the other so people can expect to be safe be cycling in a separated environment that wasn 't the case when the original estimate was put together can I interrupt and just ask a question there because I mean the the new standards were written on april 2013 so why were the numbers updated for the first daniel plane or why weren 't they are updated for the three-year plan at that time we hadn 't undertaken any any further design work to understand fully the implications of the new design standards that work has only occurred him in more recent times through the detailed designs of sections of the the five cycleways they 're currently under consideration that brought to the table if you audible or enabled better estimates to be provided from the updating basically the original rough water and cost estimates to had been able to evaluate land acquisition implications the level of improvements that was needed intersections the rooting for footpaths so the original at the original time really we only had roots on plants and we were relying on historical cost for providing cycleways without having gone to the point of more detailed designs that can inform a better cost estimate that 's where there 's been occurring over the last six months or so and perhaps I need to take responsibility for that because I 'm probably only one that here we didn 't make it clear to cancel that it was rough order of course but it 's such a huge difference you know that 's the you know that that 's the issue because I mean but somebody must have been alert when the three-year plan was done when the guidelines were changed in April 2030 and you would have been well through the you would have been out in public consultation on the three year plan buddy yes we were and I 'd have to go back for the to the record from memory the it was put in the amount the amount I but I don 't take that as gossip at 68 million years it was and it was a very quick estimate and it wasn 't caveated enough about so and it was for 13 cycleways yep okay so I mean because I mean this has been teased out in the public arena at some that 's been an issue for a number of people what when we did the annual plan last year which for a number of us were you know we were brand new to a new role we were asked to change the timetable we were told it had nothing to do with costs but we gave we were given no visibility on an increase and the costs involved certainly not to this extent until the end of last year is that right I can I can speak to the timetable because originally we were almost it was with great reluctance we brought it back for me 25 so I think we were emphasizing that to cancel terms of the estimate we gave last year can the we you year 2014 we had some assistance from the Dutch embassy and some experts from holland came we worked through in detail as a staff team the guide that council had adopted in 2013 and then work through how what 's the implications of that if you like on the road how does that work and it we needed to do a good range of examples to be able to actually understand what that meant and that wasn 't just something that could be completed by the time of last year 's annual plan we had sufficient work around about September last year to be able to arrive at the revised estimate based on work that was done over those intervening months so just in terms of process that probably would have been a good idea to bring a paper to counsel at that point to see whether there was still an appetite to proceed with all of the roots and the timetable that was set out with the revised estimates of costs rather than wait to the capital program just as in terms of process it was a bit of were involved and they 're well known as you know world-class cycling people and that they came out and there was they cover their own costs and so forth but were or was any other consideration given to any other designs any other cities any other cycling networks around the world we 're hearing a lot about the Dutch anyone else the the work that the team didn 't look internationally at what was available we had that if you want detail advice from the Dutch we 've talked with the news on transport agency we 've had it independently peer-reviewed where we 've got to and we that Queensland American stuff and in what we have put together in front of you today as a combination of best practice from those places so it 's not mean I guess there are some elements of the Dutch guide that just don 't work in New Zealand because the regulations and traffic rules around priority of cars and cyclists and Holland is quite different to auditors here so we 've taken with them if you like the philosophy but but Christ of order of rare meeting yet I understood that and I understand some key questions people want to us but I think we 've got if finishes summary of the report and also the estimates part because that I think some of that will be answered in the questions so that 's what we had intended to do and I don 't think Chris is finished sorry I interrupted because I was worried that we 're going to move on to the other issues without establishing how we got to the point that we did we 're a significant cost increase wasn 't identified until the capital program so it 's around the cost but it 's really design guidelines and no no no I don 't want to go into the design guidelines that this is this to the year but but we 'll get we 're going to get to the design guidelines all I wanted to do was to establish the timetable for when council officers knew that there was an increase and the costs associated with the new design and the point at which council was Soto Karass so we 've run through there some of the backgrounds of the original estimate and then if we move on to what 's included in the current estimate and so obviously the current estimate is based on those design guides that we are that were adopted and we 're now discussing there are requirements there for extra safety in terms of protection and cyclists that means that to provide those a lot of in a significant amount of existing infrastructure that 's on the road network needs to be moved or located to give enough room for the the four meter wide separated cycle path so it 's things like kerbin channel things like drainage features gully traps and so on they obviously all costs money to move and that 's a substantial part of the current estimate the part that we were originally envisaged would have been based on unit rates for separate or share parts such as one long qe2 drive which are only two to two-and-a-half meters wide we 're now going to 4 meters wide that 's a sixty percent increase in terms of where 's that really encourages sharing of the path both by both recreational users and commuting users who have different speeds different users use of the path and you need that sort of width to to encourage full use of it and the intersections previously intersection improvements for cycleways in the original estimate would have been minor improvements to signalize then straight in sections in terms of maybe some clear line treatments may be painting and so on to provide the green boxes that allow the sightless priority of in section in the new estimates we have separate percentages for the cyclists there 's a significant and there 's examples over the page I 'll come to it as a significant impact on the cost estimate to go from what was traditionally and typically provided and envisaged in the original estimate to what we 're looking at today and the other the current estimate also obviously provides for standards which which achieve those modal shifted objectives I 've just talked about of getting all cyclists onto a separated network that is safe and attractive to our users of 10 years relocation of existing infrastructure ready then there 's a table there which just gives you that the summary table of the original estimate that was put into the three-year plan and what is the latest estimate for each of the routes within that we have undertaken detailed or we 've got quite a high level of detail for sections of the fibroids and that has given us a very detailed costing for treatment types which we then are babe been able to apply across the whole program so we know now what the cost is a much better idea of what the cost is of an intersection you have much better idea of what the cost is of a separate off-road pathway mid-block and separated on road mid-block although still separated from the trafficker will be on the existing carriageway so then over the page by way of example one of the major changes of intersections there are a high number of intersections along these routes on that table there summarizes what the Constituent costs by way a percentage in it ranges from ten or eleven percent right up to now that is a significant increase from what was allowed or in the original estimates that in total comes up to about 28 million dollars the midlife treatments as I just talked about the original type of treatment we would have had mid thought would have written even been around four hundred thousand dollars for the example there is colombo street to travis a section of the papineau parallel if we 'd have gone to the old stand or been designing to the old standards and the old way of providing cycle or the previous we 're providing cycleways in the city that would be around four hundred thousand dollars under the new standards that 's 1.2 million so that 's the significant proportion of the increased costs those two examples themselves account for a significant amount of the move from 68 million dollars to 156 million dollars so that 's by way of background for the invitation design standards can I just ask a question on mid-block treatment i 'm sorry but i 'm not an expert so which page shows a picture i mean i 've got the don 't understand what 's driving that the cost you know I can 't see it when I take you but I don 't_''_1435.28 I don 't know what it looks like but I don 't know what I 'm looking okay but typically there 's two subtype mid-block is it 's obviously between the intersections and there are two types of treatment there there 's on the existing carriageway an example of that although not not probably what 's being proposed now is the what 's been installed out by the University on item road so there that cyclists are now completely separated from the traffic lanes by a concrete strip that provide separation between vehicles and cyclists so that would be an on-road mid-block treatment of Road midwall trends and page 177 it 's got a couple of cross section 107 7 and 17 and then an off-road treatment would be a completely separated cycleway as I say similar to what goes along qe2 drive where the route is is away from the main traffic carriageways and a path is provided of four meters wide in the in that 's in some mid blocks where there 's there 's room to achieve it and it 's preferable then there will be enough away from the carriageway there 'll be a completely separate pathway where it 's appropriate for that road section yes but I mean I 'm cut you know I 've been reading what 's been said in the media as well so but I thought that when it wasn 't this wasn 't this costed already for the April guidelines april 2013 no no what is it what 's the difference between april 2013 and now no don 't go back to 2012 when you did the original costumes no no I know there but to april 2013 so it 's three things so that the guideline is I 3013 was adopted by council yeah no work was done to be able to revise the estimates at that point I can you know that look account of that what is a kind of what one of the actual differences now between so what would have the costings been an april 2013 if those costumes had been reflect the April and the the guidelines that were adopted in 2013 just a greater level of detail is to enable working designers to look at in section and the treatment that is needed in section is in a greater level of detail than the April the ape this isn 't super this the proposal is not to supersede the april 2013 guidelines they set a higher level objectives and philosophical approach to the cycleway network the guidelines that we 're discussing today sit underneath that has technical working documents to guide the designers in things like been looking at the cross section that 's envisage Don on page 177 so these mud block treatments were always on the April guidelines what are in spores of the work yes the principles of them but not the design and there were some examples of what they may look like yeah 2.4 24 so sixty-six percent increase in there the width of the South way more of the intersection treatments mid-block have gone off road wherever possible and you mentioned one more the on-road treatments are signals a shin of intersections on whole all disciple way so they 're all unified messages and connecting the sections of soft ways together in a safe way okay and Paul before wed in mind and the change the scope from previous cautiousness how does it impact the time frame to achieving this five years this is obviously going to impact it because you were now achieving a higher grade the scope is actually our wider so there 's gonna be more work so that must impact that time from the five years completion so that there is an indicative program attached to the agenda item there is an implication but that 's more around the consultation time frame that was envisaged we we envisage the whole process to go through investigation consultation and detailed design to enable something to go out for construction is around 12 months we believe that recommendation is that a practically achievable timeframe is is nearer to seven years than the five years the five years will present its challenges and difficulties if there are any holdups on the way and through the consultation process also so forth but I think to be a very stretched target and more realistically and that 's the basis of the program that 's contained in here it is nearer to seven years there are the questions yeah it 's not appropriate to racist now I 'm sure that me will tell me but um the consultation it 's going to take some time but can we use designations through the city plan to or the district plan to actually make provision for these I mean I 'm just kind of reflect on how we use designations do motorways but when it comes to public transport and cycleways we go through a very different person the majority of the facilities that will be provided re on designated roadway or through reserve so when we go through a reserve we need to make sure we 're okay that reserves act there are some sections of existing Road where we need to take some problem front of job properties to to provide the safe facility but they are proportionately very small so the designation process on a on a blanket route is not appropriate or required much paranoiac parallel route there 's two properties whose boundary comes right out to the curb line we need to gain the boom that appears to be there but isn 't legally and we 're talking to those people directly if we purchased in it you can designate it automatically so so but if you go through a formal designation process becomes very convoluted and then there 's not a huge need but there are some leads just in series of the central city you I 'm just wondering with efforts in the whole prioritization and given the plans that we 've seen in terms of like the south frame now no longer as a cycleway and the East frame is no longer really going to be a cycleway that would meet these standards though what work have you done in the central city to understand how they 'll want to connect up in light of the changes that the government made to exploit front so in terms of Central City this program is intended to connect into the work that 's been done as part of accessible cities to provide that work with bus routes and so on and so forth in an integrated way this program really connects to the the perimeter around that as the network that feeds into that network within the central city so the center of central city network isn 't part of the major cycle waste program but obviously we have been the icing and collaborating with the the groups are responsible for designing accessible City to make sure that we do have an alarm what we 've seen Mike if you tell South Crichton that 's no longer going to be a cycleway that was going to be a psycho way so that changes now if you look at the eastern frame what we 've seen is it 'll be a really nice walking track but there were intersections all the way along so that won 't be a cycleway so I guess what I 'm it 's kind of like chicken and egg but if you don 't have what 's going to happen in the central city clearly defined how can you inform the restriction for those external routes if you East frame will be under the 30k a designation won 't it the East framers yeah yeah yeahs will at the end but not through the middle city season yeah it 's not there 's nothing to be a cycle way that will connect people going north and south so when I look at this map I kind of go so depending on where you would have your north and south connection life and influence we would put the other ones coming out but you 're saying that 's a completely separate process run by government and we just the motorcycle waitress in it we have been continued to talk to the people involved in Central City work but our design crosses the avenues and then and then it gets packed up as part of the central city grew up there with conscious of the form that those may take within the central city and that may be different what we have outside it once you get beyond the avenues the environment is different and potentially needs a different treatment but some of that detail in the central city and doing as much as we can settle and just a final question for me as do you have provision right if you take the heath get expressed expressway although we have got scoot work happening to actually do the sideways at the same time see save money we have continued to identify what skirt where they 're going and where our soccer ways might go and if there 's any opportunities we will link together the the reality is that the majority of this group tends to be down the middle of the road our works on the side of the road so it is not a lot of opportunity for that coordination that whole heathkit area is just screaming out for improvement and they 're doing a lot of the art right yeah so I mean I just want to make sure that through the resolutions today you have sufficient capacity within your program to take those opportunities it 's those opportunities arose we would take them most a lot of the skirt program as Jon says is is is quite short lengths we believe that the efficiencies and through tendering whole lengths of route when it comes to that time but certainly we will carry on discussions and communication with skirt to understand their program and integrate it with with what we 're doing and if possible then we would take advantage of something where it would provide the benefit but we are certainly not trying to do this in isolation from the skirt program with very much connected with the scare program of what what their proposed was up and there is one it 's not very small example for example on the corner of deans and fennel turn there was a need for some right improvement repair works that 's good and responsible for they 've held up off doing that they will do that when we do that Dean 's Harper faculty intersection improvements so we are talking and where there 's an opportunity we take it it 's just not a huge opportunity fortunately okay Vicki you 've been Andrew if these guidelines were revised in 2013 for the annual plan in 2013 was that the time at which you revised it from 2.4 prepared I don 't know that 's not the question the question is the tooth out to the 2013 guidelines ever it to something meters or four they would have been for me door they 've ended up going down into these guidelines in terms of the Philosopher 's has being four meters the 2.4 that I referred to earlier was was preventable freeze the 2013 guidelines it was that okay the typical width of other shared off-road cycle okay so at the time when the guideline changed from 2.4 24 which is a major increase in size over that distance did their estimates reflect that considerable change in just something as basic as that no as far as I 'm aware the estimates weren 't updated at that time the estimates have being updated as we 've moved through the more detailed design of the applying the new standards but even thinking just logically this is now gone from 2.44 maybe there might be some extra costs that wasn 't included in the 2013 annual blend or the 2014 14 and in fact in 2014 we were confronted with proposal that it would shift from 85 years to eight years and you know we we heard them we heard staff tell us that it wasn 't finance that was driving the problem and so we pushed it back to the five years and now we find that the cost wasn 't even considered you know I mean it 's just it it does leave us in a very very difficult position because we can 't simply base our commitment to 13 cycleways on cost estimates that were prepared in 2012 somebody has to come back to us and say that the new estimates are these and we have to set aside that and the budget and as I said before using the capital program without a paper without the business case without the support and documentation it 's not the way to do it I think that 's the frustration that you 're hearing from around the table and we 're I was committed to cycleways as any organization could possibly be but this is an extremely challenging position that you put us up is anyone else got any 271 the little river link achieves rating three looking at the table on page 273 the little river link is the cycleway which is in fact able to be delivered first so by the end of 2015 and looking at the paper which has just been given to us of the top five rankings the little river link is in fact the cheapest deliver yet when we look at the map on the page previous 2271 so page 217 Little River link achieves priority to not Priority One why is that they could be reversed unicycle in and not sorry sorry if you go to the table we 're the prioritization matrix the page 271 decent money so that will show you that under the category of high use potential so looking at the rosen total as a there 's a very high use a city in but at the further ends it 's it 's a much lower use so that 's why that 's an orange or yellow and then under the economic support so we were looking for a consideration where the provision of the psycho cycleway urban development work that 's council 's involved in so it school was just down a little on both of those they are relatively close when you get to the bottom of the priority list you 'll see there 's a lot more orange and lighter green down there so the ranking number in the ranking column is that not actually a ranking as i would think that means because that shows little river ranking above shag rock like little river ranking 3 and shaq rock ranking for am I not reading that table correctly that 's correct the little river is as quite as is ranking third based on this prioritization matrix and shag rock is ranking number for this job desert unfortunately this is a black-and-white copy that helicopter sort of cleared ya know a cop in front of me that the top to every every one of the five boxes is up at the what is green on the colored version three and four they have two yellows and then item for your correct hazard has an extra green box there but there 's a school matrix fact that the large portion so just remembering that crush it city has a responsibility over to put one right at the city end that connects to southern motorway cycle car and the other right out at little river itself so when you look at the root in totality it 's actually lower than the city to shake Rock Brook crew and if you recall I said earlier on that in in what are we doing now we 've actually doing some work on the city end of the little river route ahead of some of that Shack rock because that there 's a real game for us to connect to the southern motorway cycleway okay notice that 's fine thank you how David thank you look at an earlier meeting we had on cycleways there was some debate quite some debate on the cost per kilometer of establishing cycleways in and I note this report here sort of emphasizes the cost of an intersection work and I just focus on the Avon Odhikar over it you 've sort of indicated this probably two and two just under two and signalized stuff and the majority and my belief of that cycle way would be off road following the river so where my calculus i looked up its 12 kilometers long we are faced with a cost year of 1.5 2 million dollars exclusif of independent section work per kilometer to construct a circle way essentially along the riverbank red zone land on baffled as to how we can justify that sort of cost and i really really want to bit more detail in the cost per kilometer of constructing these cycleways all of these things are off well particularly looking at that one there I can 't see how we can justify 1.5 million dollars per kilometer to construct essentially a 2.4 24 metre foot up from the bottom end of the Ivan reconstruction and the city down and you Brian it 's just mind-boggling so r us don 't come back what 's up a vanity herro brute is not on the agenda today I know it 's not on the I know I don 't think so I 'll tell you what that the rest of the rest brought to counsel with detailed costing so that we can sign off on that and I 'm 41 m you know I 'm a huge supporter of cycleways moment do I want to get this right but I agree with you that the costings we need to have a lot more information relevant but we are focused today on Corey man 's trail Rapa Nui shek Rock unicycle and pepper new parallel and I 'm in unicycle and pepper no parallel though well down the track that they 're absolutely core critical to the cycleway network the other 2 i 'm not so familiar with them but what we have to focus on them today because which is why i asked the chair to change the order of the recommendations so that we are going to approve the major cycle way design principles best practice design guide and draft wayfinding and signage guide scientists interesting and in principle for the four selected roots as detailed so it 's the unprincipled approach that we 're adopting today but we 're going to have to come back and sign off on these 're getting a message from some people that they don 't want us to sign off on Rapa Nui sharecrop today and make me know maybe maybe we need to pull that one and do some more work on it or as I say it 's an unprincipled proach with some detailed decision-making going to the ite committee and you know I 'm quite happy quite comfortable for that to be delegated to them and I know that they 're not going to sign off on anything without considering all of these factors that have been raised but you know if we could focus on the cost estimates for the four that are in front of us because essentially we have to be signing off on sixteen point six million for one of them 10 points something million for Pavano a revenue no revenues the 19 million quarry man 's 16 million I mean that this is an awful lot of money we 're being asked to sign today an actual fact that the dollars and cents have got to be spelt out on the recommendation because we can 't but we have to we have to set aside that money today for these four routes if we are to proceed because there 's no point getting people to go down this track without committing the funding to go with them but it 's just before we 're talking about not the others at this stage but we I don 't think anyone should take that we 've confirmed the other no not until we 're my game boy into the money and put it on the budget I make the point that even if you 're going to look at the quarry matts trail and the Rapa Nui you 're looking at a four-fold increase in original estimate so I still want to to give a greater breakdown per kilometer of the costs involved and creating the cycleway so I think it 's seems to me to be an absurd cost per kilometer and I really want some detail as to how these come how these are derived we 've we 've had a breakdown narrow of major intersection costs to duck that off the total cost of the per kilometer to create a circle way so I mean presumably you 've got all of that detail available we terms of their costing we have detailed costings for the sections of the ones that we 've taken through that process so far to give us detailed costings so for example in the presentation that has been circulated there is a detailed costing their format high street so we have and that gives us the basis of that type of treatment to extrapolate out to inform the rest of the cost estimates we have several those types of treatments based on the detailed design that we 've done four sections of these routes which page is that on no that 's not on this call that what is they don 't know what pages I thought that was simulated as in response to a question earlier lon sorry I didn 't bring everything that has been emailed to me _"

    "text": "back to the agenda we 've got before the lunch adjournment we were looking at the item number 16 the proposed governance and organizational support for transition and what could a quick discussion about this and it seems that that there needs to be some additional work done on that we have the governance working group the desire of this paper was to establish the governance working group has a formal committee of the council so that it could be a decision-making body if necessary and it seems to me that certainly in the next two weeks we don 't need it to be a decision-making body so the governance working group can just simply take up the work of the committee or the proposed committee and the meantime and they can support the transition team that the chief executive will be setting up within the council and she 's doing that immediately so we will have the council governance working groups so the members of that myself the deputy mayor councillor man Gia 's finance spokesperson and the chairs of the council committees who are Andrew Turner Phil Clearwater structure was to enable a formalized decision making with delegated authority to be in existence as and when required but we don 't need that for the next two weeks so we can spend a couple of weeks and given the mistake around the intention of the development authority and some further work that needs to be done on the communication loop and the referral for the final outcome to counsel for ratification which was part of the series of recommendations I 'll just simply let that lie on the table when we will deal with that at the at the next meeting so we move back to cycleways the major cycleway roots program and there have been a couple of amendments _"

    "text": "as an organization support for transition now this this is the paper that has caused a bit of grief and part of it has been caused by my mistake in terms of the in terms of the development authority so if you look at the way that it 's been reworked and there was never any intention that this governance group be delegated authority to make decisions in relation to establishing the DA but what we wanted was a smaller group that was able to meet regularly to progress the framework for a Development Authority subject to statutory decision-making requirements the final decision to risk with the council so it was never intended that that this group would be making any decisions on the development authority other than to progress the framework and perhaps even bring a recommendation back to council if necessary so the transition Governance Committee was in relation to the need to make decisions around the detail and it 's a little bit like the insurance subcommittee there has been established that has been delegated authority to make a decision on accepting a a global settlement which and having that delegated authority means that it can it can work you know directly quickly and easily with the ball in this case the crown it may well be that arising out of a number of the issues that we want to address that that we will want to get into a position where we can make decisions relatively quickly the timeline for this as is quite short but at the same time there 's all of this transition we 're going on well so the idea is as to as to make sure that we 're as well prepared to advance things as we possibly can be as quickly as possible anyway so that 's the that 's the basis for it and the idea is to have all of the chairs of the committee 's plus the mere deck damier and Finance spokesperson on board for that Phil look I 'm supporter of the overall concept actually but I am concerned as only cat earlier about the processes I just think this is too quick we didn 't receive this report to feel like you city and we 've had quite a lot of background information about the DA and I 'm certainly drawn towards it but I just think an example being that tomorrow we have the workshop tomorrow around it and we make making decisions on it today and we 're not well we make we 're making decisions on that around the the Governance Committee in effect no no is that all the all is if you look at what 's on the board up above you progress the framework for a Development Authority subject to statutory decision-making requirements the final decision to risk for the council so we 're not all we 're doing is just saying that there 's a smaller group that can meet look I don 't even care take it out take out seven point one point five of that 's the issue but the idea was that we 'd have a smaller group of people that could meet and receive you know information give a steer to the group but I mean we can do that informally you don 't need to set up a well I haven only that 's the earlier one who 'd be around the establishment of that 's what I just said at the beginning that we had made a mistake you know mistakes do happen it was my mistake and the reason I made the mistake was that the with the draft paper that i saw that i didn 't realize that it was the delegated authority to make decisions in relation to establishing the authority the authority I simply meant to receive progress reports so that it could be nimble it could be quick it could report back to us but I never intended the governance group to have a decision-making role in that regard yeah thank you for the sake of group dynamics I 'm picking up that everyone wants to be involved but it 's not a decision-making role I just yeah look I know well yeah that 's fine look just take it out take out seven point one point five I can do it anyway I both Presley yard moving amendment to the smaller panel and anyone else who is able to attend so that other councillors I support that I just I think just from a governance perspective you know a lot of a sort of some of those feel excluded from some of these groups that get together and tend to quite large items and point to the insurance group went together I 've never seen any information come out of that group I 've never seen any information that 's come out of the ELT group that meets the other side you know some of the stuff that some of us would like to be involved in I just like the opportunity that if there is a possibility that we get us to make that amendment and for other people that do want to team have that ability that they are able to come along in a sheer team that Paul and I feel that seems to be coming down to the same people all the time being on these things which is fine I 'm not questioning anyone 's ability but I agree with Paul there 's some people feeling a little but not quite as connected as they could be so I Jemaine and also I 'm concerned if they did this what 's a difference between the you know that tries new transition Governance Committee in the current exists in the of the strategy in the finance committee will review all those items like all in relation to future plan the strategy of fenster issue etc well over here over late for this committee is destroyed necessary if the if the strategy and Finance get well you can play the witch hunt was only made our poster cheers of the other committees which is was my desire then that that would make sense but it doesn 't I wanted to have the chairs of the three committees the mere the deputy mayor and the finance spokesperson operating across the organization from a governance perspective but I 'm hearing that that 's not what people want there 's no point setting one up so I just think that we should defer this item can I just say I 'm not arguing in city went up I 'm arguing about the process and today as an example to me of getting the process all of those points and then we could vote it might be pressed so we can consider it later today but I don 't feel that we 've had position sufficient time alright man I just coming here I 'm not I 'm just from a management perspective this is a huge piece of work it would be a big focus for the organization over the next six months at least and probably longer and it will be setting up a transition team actually focus on some of the week it will require a lot of analysis but what we require of governance will be the ability to get quite quick direction and make sure that we are presenting the council inc christchurch city council inc view and so we need a mechanism to do that and we 're it 's the whole council or a subgroup of counselor it 's very imperative that we have there 30 to be able to get some decisions or direction quite quite clean without wanting to exclude anyone it 's just to make sure that that 's able to have him and also where she 's going to need to have some direction and advice to be able to present the view of the council as well so that contributing to I get some of their and need to make sure that we have that good original nice yeah one more rather I 'm mate she going to call a lunch adjournment and we 'll deal with this after lunch so because I think the next item on the agenda is the resolution to exclude the public so I sorry cycleways so it 's Jane back yet no Shearson so well we 're going we 'll have to deal with psycho ways after lunch anyway so so all of june now so why don 't we why don 't we come back maybe at half past one and maybe we could

it 's very short notice and that we just received this report yesterday I and I just think in terms of air pro see it 's one which will build at night you 're thinking about the next one I think but that 's the supplement against women we 're talking about accepting the supplementary reports we 've done that but we 're talking about the establishment of a Christchurch Development Agency so this has received the report on progress we ask the council to report to us by the end of the month so this is the report by the end of the month which is that they 're the report isn 't yet available we 're still reiterating the need to provide urgent advice on the potential organizational architecture of a development authority for Christchurch and in fact we have a meeting tomorrow to discuss that very thing but I thought on the record that the that the council organization was aware that would ask for report by a particular date that date hasn 't been able to be met it was a challenging date so I 'm not criticizing anyone for that but I think the record has to show that we received a report by the date that we asked for it doesn 't provide all of it doesn 't provide what we 've asked for yet but it sets up a requirement now to provide for councils further consideration as soon as practically possible and in fact I think that I would rather that that said request that this we provide of the council 's through the consideration at the next meeting of the council and then it 's then again if we can get as much information in front of the council at the next meeting then that 's then that 's the challenge to the organization it 's to me its core critical this is the this is the basis of the architectural changes that need to be implemented and order for us to get on report which I 'll speak to you yeah okay stood around on page 53 to it lists what the counselors expect to have expected to have done by the end of January and they 're quite a large number of things they 're a matter of pro yeah that 's an exciting ah does a little bit i 'm sorry yeah what this is the establishment of the DEA this is there are two separate papers so we 're going to go on to the one that you 're all referring to needs oh oh we know it 's item 16 you 're clinging advisory 60 I yeah yeah sorry Andrey yeah this is some essentially a holding report nothing is good that this is here um when we approved the establishment of da in principle back in December we we asked for a lot of information to come in a further report by the 30th of january i think this report is good in as much as it tells us that that work is underway we haven 't quite got there yes better to have received this report now which is what we asked for but this essentially is just a holding report pending that further information and of course we 've got the workshop tomorrow which will be a really good opportunity for counselors to have input into the back end of that process in terms of that report coming to the next meeting so this is quite light on information and for good reason the next report we would expect to have the information that we asked for in december plus the other work that 's been done by the working group plus of course anything that term comes up as a result of that was yesterday in form there 's an informal meeting tomorrow where the working group will report back to the full council all right yani wondering um I know that there 's already been a report that 's kind of been prepared or some information from the consultants um is it possibly get off there will be a report circulated today that the hope that that 's already been to the working party the working party weren 't satisfied with some elements of available today for the meeting tomorrow just work tomorrow with basically got an hour at the end of the day we 've got other commitments on as well which I don 't think is going to be long enough so well it may not be but I 'm but I think it 's good that we get a heads up for that talk but is it possible to maybe think about scheduling some other time next week or we may well have to but it depends i mean i think people will be quite excited by the progress that we 've made all right Jenny beat them to become for it before point of one year here on 23rd January weather weather is the same as the tomorrow this date will be back from star be the same same date or not 20 so january our data agent working great other then that report feedback was to the working group 14 cool i 'll kind of looking set up a working group to automatically close you here i confuse yeah Thank utilities on that cuz I can 't remember I who 's all right um I think it I think it 's just the estimate just the three is it or is it the I know Andrews honor I 'm on Paul reef I think sorry i don 't i don 't have the full list in front of me I just sorry um I can 't run in all know the resolutions here I 'm sorry it 's um I don 't want to hold up the meeting as this core critical to the passing of the resolution we can no no that will know I mean we 'll send it out this afternoon with the report about who who SAT around the table when and received we had it

say aye those opposed say no that 's carried it 's really weird that 's exactly what I thought would happen before it 's a development contribution central city rebate scheme would someone like to move that Jamie seconded by Paul as there are there any questions yani okay any just any questions yep I just wanted to confirm with you that the issue was regards to the website you know who was the machine at you and I were dealing was a year or so ago around the criteria for DC 's is that all clear now and being clarified on the website was to do with criteria around accessing the dc 's and me being a bit now the website now much better reflects what the council 's position is so it 's clearer to applicants what what 's required of them and the advice I 've got is that that certainly that 's much clearer for staff and for people working with it Jamie really quickly sweet to this oh no hang on but questions yeah no jaani already indicated this it was questions so discussion so then yarn even Jamie sorry yeah I just um given our financial situation and you know I think we 've been incredibly generous and providing this fund for a year but I don 't support extending it I think of our financial situation the fact that we 're struggling to afford to fix our own housing our own social housing which doesn 't get a scene of ratepayers money we 're giving rate payers money to private developers I just can 't justify that in my head so I think given the financial situations that we 're facing we tried to act as an incentive to encourage some early development in the central city you know a lot of and what it was going to happen there is going to happen so I actually think that we cannot afford to do this I don 't think it 's it 's morally justifiable in the situation we find where the housing for the most vulnerable we can 't afford to fix and we 're not spending rate payer money on but private developers for 500,000 apartment or for hire are getting a ratepayer subsidy I just I can 't support that so I will vote against us Thank You Janie oh it 's a little bit awkward because i was going to praise this council just in so everyone else buy yarn even with this one it was passed obviously in the long term plan last term that this this initiative a three year plan at the time and in reaffirmed by this council and you guys made it made a good call because you hear the informal things which which is all well and good and the leaders to the mere from the New Zealand property institute which Sid was one of the best single things that we did you that said on the development forum we have about half a dozen people around this table will be acutely aware that the membership of that have reiterated what the property council put in there and the letter to the mayor which includes the likes of the Chamber of Commerce saying that this was just a superb initiative and and it 's a testament idea so when you when you look at it that you know close to eighty percent of this has has of this funders be exhausted the reoccurring theme that comes through the development forum which I chair and it is a tricky one that 's always a trade off and you know that you know if you people who enjoy the city you need to have development and all with us but it 's never just one thing it 's like the bigs of a chair that the Holy See lien holder City up and take it forward so you know there 'll be there 'll be questions and then robust debate with with staff and makes ourselves if we look to it standard that 's wanted it standard and in some more certainty and clarity around things there but it 's been overwhelmingly positive the numbers speak for themselves so I want to say well done to you for for a firming it like you did and and we 'll cross that bridge when we come to it from there what the members of the development former wanting but um yeah it 's a job well done that speaks for itself Paul I 'll just agree with the counselor golf on that and also if she puts in line with a vision to have 20,000 and more people living in the inner city and the city has struggled to get up and going and we need to make sure that as a council we do everything we can to get our heart beating again we 've had some temporary projects that having had some reasonable success but we 're seeing slow development we could remember the central city set up a recording for over two years and that actually hindered a bit of the rebuild so we have to do everything we can to ensure it is the heart of that culture it 's also into the heart of actually what drives you know people do want to come and visit your city then generally come on a visit you know your suburban key activity centers they want to come in and see giardia city we want to see people living in our city enjoying your city and making it a safe place to be and you can only do that with people like that Olivia and that 's a problem we had pre youthquake so I think it 's really important that we sit in behind us here and say what we 're going to do and do it and follow it through and support our city yeah well I might just add a word and support of that as well because I think that in fact i give it slightly frustrated with comparing you know we could spend this or or spend it on this it 's actually not a choice it 's actually a question of priorities and in competing interest can have a status in terms of priorities for different reasons central city back on its feet it 's a priority to get our social housing back on its feet as well so for me this is a no-brainer it 's an absolute requirement that we ensure that the that our central city is that living breathing space and actually the same bushin existed before the earthquakes you know the the central the sorry the urban development strategy made it absolutely crystal clear that the central city was where we needed to focus that increased and population residential environment a positive friendly welcoming residential environment for people and I think that this is one way of getting at it 's only one component and a bigger picture and I very much support it so I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no and have that recorded pinky thank you that 's carried now we move on to the 100 resilient cities strategic framework and set it Mike hey I would like to move their recommendation but I might want to add another recommendation to it which is to authorize so 8.6 authorized the a council staff member one council staff member to attend the third world conference on disaster risk reduction and sindh I which immediately precedes the AI yep sendai japan Sorry mate might be better to put sendai japan which immediately precedes the delegation to China the reason that I 'm putting that is is that we can include their fear my fear and the and the China affair I mean that the cost of getting from japan to china is marginal so the reason that I 've put it there is an authorization is that it 's not yet confirmed that i will attend that we are working with a number of parties including central government and the UN is dr and the World Health Organization and respect to a number of speaking opportunities at the conference alright so are there any questions of mike is there any discussion oh do we have a seconder Oh Glenn your heavy to see conduct yeah good very good I mean it gave a very kind of comprehensive integral and develop my understanding further of resilience and what we you know how we discussion looks like you 're off the hook Oh a date yeah look I just like to reiterate Glenn 's comments if it was very good reporting and likewise to extend my interpretation of resilience a quote somewhat so very good don 't don 't ask yeah yeah yes Paul I just want to say that attending these conferences is really really important now it 's amazing the people you meet having been in Guangzhou does recently for the innovation or wood between one as a city out of you know the entire world 250 or dare applicants but these things actually you make connections you hear other ideas and what people are doing on the ground is actually really really important and I just want to feel and also a great thing right well I 've just oldest briefly comment I mean I I know that the word resilience has been a bit of a frustration for a lot of people because you know there are people who come unto christ church and say oh you 're all so resilient here in christchurch and in fact they mean stoic know we can pretty much you know put up with things but and this is a point that i 'm actually going to make a speech that i 'm giving this evening and that is that the 3rd to the 5th years the three to five years that 's really really hard for people and people think that we 're heading up towards the the fourth anniversary but actually the the last of the major aftershocks was the 23rd of december two thousand eleven so actually it was the beginning of 2012 that 's where we start to measure the three years where we 're in year three now and so for the next you know a couple of years it 's going to be really really hard for people and building a resilience framework that focuses on leadership and strategy health and well-being economy and society infrastructure and environment the framework works really well with the new structure that we 've put in place for the committee 's and the way that we 're operating as a council and i think that this building and understanding that resilience is be strong in the face of adversity but actually it 's more than just bouncing back or bouncing forward as people say it is the capacity to adapt but more importantly it 's the capacity to co-create a new normal for our city and I know that Paul 's adopted the phrase the new normal as the way to describe the way forward for us but when you think of what our transitional movement has actually delivered for our city it actually enables us to think about a new way of actually operating and so my whole you know theme that I 've set around us as is to be able to leave the city resilient in its governance structure a new governance for a city which is about a co-created environment which is participatory budgeting participatory democracy something that I think that Christ Church would welcome and as the one city I think in the country that is well well set up to do that so yeah that Rahm Emanuel who was the mayor of Chicago or who is the mayor of Chicago when he was the chief of go to waste and the reason that he was saying that was it 's always an opportunity to do things you never thought you could do before and if that 's the opportunity that sits with our city right now so I think that this framework gives us the capacity to work with other organizations and make that happen so thank you very much for all the work that you 've done Mike so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye I suppose they know that 's carried thank you right now Jamie you 'd like to move that the reporters a whole be adopted and seconded by ref and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

aren 't any difficult questions because the people that are here are going to have to ask them right I did have a question on on the first item on the residential land availability and crashes see so let 's we move on to the development contributions for family flex converted to second units is that a certain item that we could deal with feser as a council without staff here to answer questions yep would you like to move that Jamie seconded by anyone like to see connect um ref mangie so that is there any discussion yep Paul oh there are questions that in just a couple of questions this with regard to you know we haven 't got any staff here so that 's why i asked the question can we deal with us without questions to staff so if the answer to that is no it 's rebate scheme oh here is Mike teal and we can come back to it so we 'll go back to the first one which is the residential land availability and Christchurch City and um yeah so the first item is that as the residential land available units receiving the report the question the question I 've got is kind of a repeat of a question that I 've asked and formerly of staff but I kind of want to formalize it that the Greenfield priority areas identified that we have what 19,000 775 potential sections available and they 're of those I can 't tell how many know that there are eleven thousand seven hundred and seventy they 'd already have infrastructure available is that right I mean I can 't what I 'll tell you what I want and then you can tell me whether it 's possible what I want is I want to have a mac of the of of Christchurch where land as has been zoned for development where and in what stage each component of it is up to so for example Preston 's road are in the process of developing X number of sections so and that 's all go that 's all infrastructure and everything 's there so it 's kind of like who owns it where is it up to and the process because what I 'm concerned about is that there may be people who are sitting on land that has been zoned for development and they 're not developing it and I kind of like to well be blunt call it out because I think that christ church needs to have the land that has been made available really for development i mean it 's it 's got to be ready are we holding it up because we haven 't put the infrastructure and as the owner of the land not preceding that that 's what I want to know and I want to be able to see there on a map so that we can regularly look at where things are up to and I found it very difficult to compare the numbers and these different blocks because I couldn 't tell if they were the same pieces of so it 's possible and and we have mark and I have spoken about the fact that we 'd like to modify the way this is presented because it 's it 's an awkward set of numbers to work your way through me certainly accept that we can certainly identify oversee we 've got the green fields land in terms of priority areas we can identify the zoning we can identify which and what and the extent of infrastructure availability what we what we don 't and we can demonstrate we can met but only historically what subdivisions have been approved what we don 't have a good handle on this developers tell us is which ones have actually prepared to put on the market because we don 't actually hold that information we 've tried a number of ways to look at how we might get that information in a de facto manner so we can we can take them that we can draw that picture so far we can 't get it to exactly what properties are on the market even though we do actually run a website that put on and which parts of the city but what we I mean somebody else might do that job for us not looking anywhere in particular if we put the information out in the public arena it will be obvious that there are questions to be asked around this development that hasn 't preceded I mean the series been set aside but for residential you haven 't done anything with it the infrastructures the year it 's ready to go why yeah you know I mean that doesn 't have to be a question we ask there are others who will ask that question yeah because I mean people there 's been a lot of discussion around land banking ratcheting up the prices and I think we 've got to call it out Yanni if you turn to page 100 um sorry is that that 's not item is attachment Oh see attachment as I understand it so basically you had 925 consents issued total things just tell us which line your pointless total greenfield priority areas if you go across between those two group in the middle of you 've got 11,000 they 1,200 sections that are basically waiting for infrastructure so you take that out of the 20,000 so what it shows to me you 've only had ten percent of the sections that could be built on their cut ahead building consents yesterday or today or tomorrow you 've only got ten percent of the land that we 've resigned and provided infrastructure to being developed on which seems absolutely extraordinary giving given our financial situation in terms of housing and the housing crisis that we have a set Harris that different from what I just asked for um because you were saying you couldn 't see what the numbers were what I 'm saying is I think the numbers are see where they are can 't see me I 'm done oh so I mean I just wanted to confirm that that 's the case that there 's basically it 's fair to say that about 10 persons only ten percent of the land that we rapidly resigned and hurriedly built infrastructure to serve us to deal with the housing crisis only teen the scene or in terms of housing that 's that 's that 's correct that 925 building consents have been issued in areas where there 's attend that 10,000 potential sections and zone greenfield areas but there 's a rate a range of reasons for why areas would have developed infrastructure constraints limits the potential development of some of that 10,000 saw been in resigned so it 's not necessarily land banking or other private constraints it 's potentially because of infrastructure constraints which is why I asked for that that 's what I want to say is we 're we 're its ass you know all the constraints with them the author and the other that 's how the other key issue is that those greenfield part here is our what a 20 year horizon these dis greenfield priority areas are identified in maleeni 's recovery plan for provide for demand 32 2028 so you wouldn 't expect so society to call it crossed my I mean I suppose the issue that counselor your hands and raises is right in the inside of the in the absolute sense but obviously we now and immediately anyway because we would accept their would not a meet the demand and be we wouldn 't want to see all that land absorb because that land as far in excess of what we need to support demand today it is a it is to toot you know over ten years away but I can 't what I 'm starting to understand is and that 's going to get information back which which I appreciate is the whole idea that we free up more land for development when we 've got or we 've got far too much land already and we 're not seeing development happening so we 've got a surplus of land that 's able to be developed on that hasn 't been developed and yet every every indication we 're getting from central government through the district plan review is just free up more zones for development I don 't know the message that we 're getting from the from central government is that they want to see intensification and areas around key activity centers and in the CBD which is actually in don 't agree that governments putting pressure on 23 walk the land use recovery plan did identify but it was a wider horizon but i do want to see what 's holding up the development of those areas I thought that government had been pretty clear that that counselors were limiting lean supply which driving things like no they haven 't said that all of us at all in fact the land use recovery plan fast treat the RPS requirements that was going through an environment court process at the time of the earthquake thank you so the other information that I 've asked come from the mayor 's office which was the other thing that I think is really important for us to understand is who is actually owning these houses so how many people are actually owning a house then when you think of things like affordability I know the mayor 's office had some statistics around that it looks like there 's fewer people owning homes but fewer people are owning more than one eye on it i 'm sorry i 'm just going to present it availability in christchurch city it 's got nothing to do with the houses that are built on them other then they that 's what it 's available for so I 'm just ruling that question out of order on this issue you can raise it somewhere else that just doesn 't it doesn 't sit with this is not for our planners to answer can I what 's the process to get their information well well if my office has got the information just ask them for over good you 'll get it but I mean okay oh we went I went to penalty pencil right so um alright will I show Jimmy thank you thank you for the presentation fought back during the committee I was unaware I 'd have for one person okay on page 78 in page 79 these are two tables I just don 't know what the relations for instance like a potential section no subjection to the subdivision application if compared to pure with the current is a drug for 21 however you is reviewed the sub sub division consent is increased 36 I is lumber if the job 21 stupid the other column is a increase the 21 because the timeline is tuned to louvain but last year am i right viewers in the chlorine there are quite a difference the the 15 ok any other the source of land availability or not from from memory there was there was a the sections consented within large greenfield areas like item field mission and Westmoreland those areas which they 're largely developed out now there was some duplication of previous figures presented so there was a correction made to the potential number of sections and those greenfield areas yes and that 's why the number of the number of the increase of 21 differs from 36 user and some corrections from the last report ok duplicate ok so the how about the table on page 279 is the same situation the queue is 13,000 by parents are reduced to the 11,000 whether it means the host info charger constraint has been the release has been available now that that reduction and the number of consent in the number of sections with infrastructure constraints it to support development of our dear old king and there is store planning constraints to the developments of the southern part of the Alberta a block on the southern side of the motorway but that reduction of 1600 reflects that implementation of the infrastructure to service that block now thank you alright let me say our pool just might be the right question for the sansa but I 'm just actually interested in there and the vacuum systems white waste why systems given some of the concerns in the yeast around the vacuum system has been installed how these being received web developers in their new homeowners in these areas this system it 's probably something I we can answer that 's probably something for Jane perhaps or the building consent guys respond to it would be good to find out that information on birthday see just the the wastewater vacuum systems you know we 've had a lot of issues some of the reasons not one of these installed on their properties because of concerns I just want to know how they actually been received by the developers and set pradesh a yep it 's good glynn thank you i 'm curious as well about this supply situation given that the theory suggested it was a supply-side problem over housing in christchurch and there seems to be an abundance of supply here I actually wonder is it an affordable supply side problem selling district councils just zoned blend that I was involved in backing a trust to try and get redzone residents there it was turned down quite some opposition to it just as owned it for housing it is when it comes to our approach to painting what are the chances that we can take on board you know and one of our objectives in the accord with the crown is to promote affordable housing so what are the chances we can have that kind of nimbleness to to take on board these initiatives to so that part of these developments are affordable well I think about it we 've done that without air it may require some affordability and and some affordable housing within that context and it 's not something that that 's something the government I 'm sorry not our tier sprayed on its spray them sprayed on what 's that one called miss meadow lands hey the meadowlands develop the mirror lens develop and that was there 's an exemplar project so that 's the affordable housing and really fits within that frame rather than within the land use yes yeah this is a land juice report so I just I 'm trying to strut I know you 're trying to frame your question to fit within the context that are bought but I think it 's not within the context of the report yeah yeah and i think that the simple axiom that somehow is out there that simply having lots and lots of land means cheaper sections well it doesn 't never it 's never been right and it 's the opposite is right in fact if you don 't have land sections can rise but it 's not axiomatic and so much as if you have lots of land doesn 't suddenly get cheaper yeah so if we 're looking at affordability we have to look at different levers then simply around so there 's a whole lot of things ownership yeah but I mean eased we 've seen we can make the land available it doesn 't mean that it gets developed that 's right and and nor and so there is a natural progression in the process so you know council traditionally try and send long-term signals to the market about where they want to develop that helps landowner start to make choices it starts to guide our long-term infrastructure investment and obviously we will deliver that infrastructure investment hopefully in a timely manner that actually enables the market to respond yeah and so that 's part of the process of setting that and the government has moved to that moving in that direction across the country by trying to encourage councils I think legislatively they 're proposing to have minimum numbers of available land but there 's a difference between land Service land sections on the market and it 's all part of the same bigger story yeah so I 'll move the recommendation Jamie do you want to second that I 'll just note the second part to meet with us to discuss the latest report on the link between land use and housing supply and that 's where I think some of the conversation that we 've had here today will be incredibly useful yeah yeah yani yeah to get this information and I think it categorically shows that that basically opening up more land it doesn 't deal with some of the key issues that we 're facing is a city and I really do think it 's important to understand who 's owning those houses that are being built because they don 't appear to be affordable and it appears that what we 're seeing is that is we 're opening up more land for fewer people to own more properties each and for more people not to own a single property at all so I think we do have to start looking at those other mechanisms as we rezone land that enables people to be able to afford their first home and and be deal with the issues that we 're facing in terms of the wider community benefit for our city budget clear from the government that from according to Bill English that worsening poverty inequality was being caused by restricting Lee and supply and I think the information we 've gotten this report shows quite clearly that that is not the problem the problem is getting development to occur on land that has been resigned in fact home and I think we need to start looking at how we answer that fundamental question because what we 've seen as developments that aren 't affordable and that are not happening when we 've got a housing crisis in our city so I think we do need to do a lot more work and maybe it 's cut a meeting with the Productivity Commission we can generate a report back to council about some of these new ideas of thinking but I appreciate the information I just think we need to be realistic but opening up more land is not dealing with the problem that we have okay the rezoning land in and of itself does not actually reduce the price of housing does not make housing affordable and that we actually need much more complex and complicated than just changing the R&A act or making more land available I take the point that it works the other way that if the land supply is constrained that section process and therefore house prices will go up but it doesn 't work in reverse and that 's why in the activity management plan that goes for discussion and the long-term plan the new housing development unit housing development agency that you requires a name will be involved in both social housing and take some action on seeking to take some action on affordability of housing because we have this really bizarre situation in Christchurch at the moment where some people are actually paying more and rent then they could afford especially today as the interest rates have come down to buy their own house for but they cannot get ten or twenty percent deposit that they are required to so there are some quite simple ways in which a number of agencies acting together could actually help people into homes which is I think one of the goals that the community of christ church at the rate payers expense I totally buy that and but it does require a much more complex and array of much more of an array of solutions than the simple RMA changes or rezone more green fields we know that we 've seen that for the last year so we know that the solutions are different then what 's being promulgated good i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie thank you _"

  {
    "text": "port of the chief executive which is at page 61 and I 'll hand over to Carlene thank you that there are just a couple things I wanted to speak to one of which is that given that we 've had at least 35 separate media inquiries in the past it and working days around the regulatory compliance you know I just want to talk to you a little bit about yeah it is a bit it 's not very loud needs to be turned up sorry it may not make me yeah maybe that 's just going to have to be a bit closer yeah I 'll lean forward given that in the last seven days we 've had at least 35 separate media inquiries around the regulatory compliance units work I just thought and given that you 've asked me some questions about that I just thought I 'd talk a little bit about the work that they do and how they actually work across these are shoes so just in terms of the scope the scope of the unit is really wide and varied and it managed council so that includes things such as animal management parking compliance environmental compliance including things such as noise can land contamination asbestos water quality nuisance complaints hazardous substances alcohol licensing and health lines and things such as food premises but there 's also other compliances such as brothels swimming pools quarry 's resource consent monitoring so see the huge scope in terms of the work that they do and just in terms of the sort of the amount of work that I have in terms of their number of complaints and the 2013-2014 figures take dog complaints for instance so they had 12,000 eight around 12,800 dog nuisance complaints so that includes things like dog attacks unregistered dogs licensed investigations in impounding just as examples which was a TS 615 increase over the previous year but a 1 percent decrease in high priority cases but more the increases were on things such as barking stray dogs or fouling dogs which around about fifty percent of the complaints so a lot of those medium level complaints in sight increase in their area they also deal with things such as Newsome complaints which actually did slightly decrease on the previous year noise complaints they continue to be a significant activity for the unit so in that 2013-2014 year about 12 and a half thousand complaints over the year the majority of which are related to radio stereos and TVs about nine and a half thousand give you that level of service and there 's been some decrease in it because of the way that they deal with those and in the 13 14 year there are 58 seizures of noise equipment so in terms of how the unit works it really works within the best practice regulatory framework array and has done so for a number of years around non-compliance they use what they call it made model VA de it 's well recognized and utilized by a wide variety of regulatory agencies invade stands for voluntary assisted directed and enforced depending on the level degree of non-compliance in addition to that the council has to meet thresholds defined by the Solicitor General 's guidelines for prosecution which are around even an evidential sufficiency so that 's about having sufficient and credible and so the actions being range from education infringement notices abatement notices and prosecution so there 's a range of things that they do they were quite proactively in terms of trying to prevent issues until fishes early with a 10 but in general staff also used tools such as mething of hotspots so that you can understand where and why various complaints and whether a gregation and where to target their resources so whilst it 's not perfect the processor team of the team is really committed to providing a sort of professional service as well as having a continuous improvement process in terms of looking at everything that they do and how to learn from things such as the recent events and look at how they improve the way that they respond to that excuse me they also benchmark themselves against other territory authorities and the regulatory processes and approaches are considered and that not to mention that they collaborate with other regulatory agencies to solve some of the wider issues so as mentioned earlier whilst we may not monitor some things we may have to deal with agencies are around there so just an example with a the teams looking at process improvements for long-term noise matters and they 're currently reviewing the use of infringement and abandonment notices for these sorts of issues in making changes to the reporting systems and so that 's more easy to facilitate identification and tracking of those sort of problem properties there 's also been discussion in recent days without after-hours contractors to ensure that our long-term playing kpi 's will we meet within the standard that we require so constantly looking at the issues and trying to improve our responses to those things as part of everything that they do just a couple of other issues I want to touch on so our people in culture committees meet several times in the last year we 've non priority areas outlined by staff around two key themes that have been established by staff one about developing cultural service to the cluster on we were internal or external and also internally about the way that we work together making sure that that 's a better process in terms of how we those areas the strategies around leadership capability making the council more accessible to the community and empowering people to make decisions are some of the three areas that they really want to focus on initially in just in that vein the executive leadership team has just launched a significant internal program across the organization that 's really aimed at refocus and the council to being much more externally in customer focused being more efficient and continually looking at how we can prove the way that we deliver our services both internally and externally and the real value will that will be in the things that we see that change in the way that people interact with the council and the council services and the benefit that they get from those so I 'll update you regally and this report on how that 's progressing thank you just a couple of questions one in relation to the capital expenditure and we 've got a estimated underspin of 392 million I just want to know if we continue that 's what a pattern of underspin oh no these are an anomaly deal this and the spin going forward how does it affect the the pinch point of our around financial shortfall and the years to come the second question I have is just around the rates and the the debit funds and do we seen those develop forms out with the rating bills so we can actually encourage these people to get to hurt themselves onto that direct debit I 'll start that first so we have I think a 35-percent direct debit which we 'd like to see higher so there was initially some advertising of that but now indeed there 's a notice that goes out with the rates that say that you can do that I 'm provided through direct debit in terms of the capital that 's an area that we 're looking at in terms of how we improve our Indian prices so that we don 't over promise and under-deliver there are some issues in terms of specific areas that in the capital plan I think Leah that contributes significantly Tibet in terms of pinch points in terms of our financial strategy I might have to to the long-term plan will be providing estimates and assumptions within the long-term plan of care afford and capital expenditure so that will be clear within the long-term plan as to how it flows through and where the pinch points are because as well as any particular carryforwards from this year or next year the underlying capital expenditure is also obviously taken into account to SF at the time with a net debt to revenue it is going to flow throughout the entire I 'm 10 or even 30 years and beyond thank you um thank you i have several questions um I just wanted to check on just on page 63 I note that we have received 2.5 million from Sarah their contribution to district plan costs is that fifty percent of our costs I understand was that they were going to 5050 but but it seems like the the agreement as I understand it is that it was fifty percent of the five million that was budgeted and then there would be a discussion of anything over and above that right okay um the Sumner Road corridor which scheduled to be progress now and what 's the time prime but has it has it all been agreed that it will go ahead neither getting hand over to Dave Edinson I think there are still some discussions going on on the road sorry David you 've been caught on the home so they 're just an update on the timetable for some road for people that don 't speak you know sort of that language horizontal infrastructure governance yep there with we 've had a briefing so I presume the report that goes to huggers based on the briefing that we 've received in terms of what 's going to happen on each of those corridors and there 's a chance to see is not receiving this apart from basically yo grievance passed down to Wilton which is the last one that needs to be released the horizontal structure governance group has already released the word on the three major club said we 've got contains and some of the physical works my understanding of the house was not out today on the first of those that we down to start here put it on there so become hoping in a very short people we can 't see the removal of some of those payments so we released stop that part but essential but over the health workers can I sort of kind of interrupt the line of questioning and just say they you know from a psychological point of view the removal of the containers would mean a lot to the people in their area and the second thing is is that you 've got this cycle way open at the top of the the road open for cyclists across the the summit road is there any chance of that being allowed on the other side going down and to going down into little at any point well I mean oh dear well that won 't be welcomed by certain cyclists and the family but setting aside all personal interest yeah but if that 's not going to start for a while it might actually be possible if the roads clear for cyclists to user come on they don 't mind taking risks they go on the road just while we 're on Sumner just I just wanted to raise the issue of of doing things differently in terms of road closures and I know Paul and I have been in the mayor 's office just working through that when people we just put public notices in the priest but obviously the reason it 's that are directly affected would be really good to personally give them a copy of the public notice so they knew how what was being proposed and they knew what the objections process was so I just really wanted to ask the chief executive what measures we can put in place to ensure that rather than just relying on the event organizer to do it that we can be really satisfied that the local people that are directly affected our well aware of what the process is and can be involved yes thank you for that so we were just discussing this yesterday and have agreed that we do need to look at that to look at who has responsibility and we think that the council should take on that responsibility and what is just a press release as opposed to actually people being individually notified so we 'll come back with crises around it and agree that we need to be much more proactive pray and thank you for that and into the final question for me was just why don 't we had any update around the time frame for delivery of the Metro sports you know to hand over to Dave sorry Dave another another snap answer required have we hit an update from Sarah on the progress of the Metro sports facility in the time frame the business case but again it 's going to go up through that put together through working parties one of them specifically on the business case the desktop people prob council people from Sarah people from Treasury and people from the Prime Minister 's Office to thank Prime get their start we 've got cameras in proper so they are looking I know that one week and I 'm sorry I don 't know what the outcome of that meeting was a long produce domain I will get enough so we all be 's been through cabinet which we signed off sign off the speeder we 've got their initial briefing at this it was at six options we consolidated Minnesota Council consolidated all night on a proposal but the crown I just think some regular communication to the community over what 's happening in terms of time frames and process is really important a few counts as having sex with an appt una y hearings and one of the things that 's come through really clearly as if people are really missing those aquatic and recreational facilities in our city and no really you know running out of patience in nothing really patient but I think just regular communication about well that 's great Jamie I 'm first of all I 'm not what a counselor that does this all the time or anything but um I don 't deal with every report but thank you so much for this this is an outstanding chief executive for my opinion the dashboard approach the stuff that you need to know H&S it 's a breath of fresh air and local government so thank me seemed to go to hear health and safety really really love having this in there but just a couple of things around there 's one that I was a bit confused about was that in December 2014 we had one lost time injury we 've got 41 days lost I 'm a little bit unsure how that connects and then also we 've got one serious harmon Siddhant november and i want to know can we is being made aware of that if there 's a serious um notification go to work so i think that saying we 've got to know about I know you 're absolutely right and actually a next report will actually had some of the themes so you and understand what a serious injury it as a mother if you stayed one time I understand it may be in pigs because it could be privacy issues and that 's what stuff so maybe even the sea and a blue metas committee could be a place to drill into more of the health and safety as a suggestion and just with that then if that longer time frame of troffer like the total wreck ordinance and frequency rate more than two months just so you can see those patterns at least 12 months would be ideal and also lead indicators like we 've got the near misses and that 's really it so you know unsafe x or safety ideas those sort of things and yeah so that could be for the employment matters committee though no it 's so much time want to improve the way that it 's presented and also the mitigating yeah i can say that europe you understand what it takes you hit me so the other thing is that we 're starting making sure that we are looking at these and then longer-term to see trends your honor in the same with things like the exit survey so that we actually can understanding of where we should focus on their energies are we a member or is there an equivalent of like the new zealand business leaders health and safety for so you 've got you know Chivas et herbs from around the country i think was opened by is local government a member of that or is there a local government equivalent Jimmy filled in alley to patients and first one on me sorry on page is 66 the workforce came over regarding to the lumbers living in numbers the point my question is what 's the relationship between the list to learn you know category especially kind of you know what solution there if we review the herring employee the Opie Opie operational group we consider overall numbers as 36 but in the living is a 19 so I 'm not sure that I 'll recruit a new employees depends on our living or we have over all the kind of manpower human resource development a skill you know this is skilled a person no matter what kind of person live in a state or I just want to know yeah you 'll see a number of those are those city sucks are on part-time or 16 so some of those will be seasonal workers such as lifeguards or recreation or you know so so they won 't necessarily make sure those people leaving as opposed to and we do get reports on those but just to recognize that it 's not necessary or 141 replacement can question certain even the director of infrastructure and depth he mentioned earlier regarding to the ankle pocket where we presented to the council in early paper about I 'm still concerned because why the Tinker Bell kind of sealed the regular report even if no further the kind of progress at ease have the more or less the kind of the progress so I still think you know we should have listened to these kind of update status from the CEO for instance like I remember the new are the homebuilder service and the library facility where star were presented to the communal pool in December and further to a committee and a former counsel but up to now I didn 't have any updated status regarding to this facility also some other anchor projects still no any further progress so whether we can set up this kind of you know in the regular the report so it was a rigger we did include that in the previous CEO reports of rebuild would provide a separate report on a regular basis to the infrastructure committee and so that 's where that is so it may be that what we do is actually much for that goes out to all consoles no but it 's a good point and I think I mean it seemed appropriate to take it out of the chief executives report because this is more a chief executives report but to have a regular update on where the projects are trekking and when you say anchor projects are no you mean whom be and Ferguson and I know many teasing you I know what a strong advocate you are for your community I was being complementary okay so we 'll sort that out Phil alley then Glenn it thanks for your report I agreed with what jamie has seen develop that you report in cali nenda the like their people in culture committee that 's a very positive park in die converge for Economic Committee I wanted to ask you about the people part under suspicion relation to the exit survey and clearly the response rate as what steps are we as a council taking to make sure we get better information yes so we 'd like to use that information it 's a good chance of people to be free and Frank about the good things and the things that we could improve on so what we 'd like to do is that when we once we receive a resignation is to schedule an in exit interview so that we can actually gather that information as part of the somebody leaving an organization so it 's just an ordinary part of that process so previously though like the numbers interviewed say has been low so are we taking the steps to actually increase you know find FDL Britain if I almost I once I men dating a but just making it past part of somebody that you 're leaving so it 's obviously voluntary so people don 't need to follow up and so we make it a part of the normal process like you know standing cards no such things we make part of that process as well I think we an expectation yeah I after the person 's already left so if your schedule and exit interview at the time that the that the resignation is received then you actually it will happen more often than not so I think the numbers are going to increase so I 'm glad we 've got a baseline here I think that 's as low as it will go I hope le then Glenn thank you just looking at community engagement under customer service I wanted to know whether you have stats information related to other ways that people get in touch via email at war by Twitter I 've been using Twitter a lot particularly at the weekend and find that it 's fantastic because the response is immediate whereas with an email you 're advised that we will be in touch i believe between five and ten days so and also that twitter needs to follow up to say that the job has been done or why the job can 't_''_1558.95 be done and i also around that wanted to ask about delivery of service around maintenance as well and how we can find out weed growth and so forth around the city that doesn 't appear to be being addressed however when I tweet and re face around a specific area it is dealt with pretty much immediately which raises the question is that on a circuit as it on ur a list of to do or not and if not why not and how often have we changed that level of service could we find that out sorry that was rather garble here sorry I 'm Jane can respond to that one and in response to the the issue about monitoring you know all the feedback that we get complaints or so forth I 'm not aware that we collate that but I think it 's something that we do and certainly a my understanding is that people in the call center do monitor Twitter in social media sites here but you also mentioned that you 'd like to make sure there was a feedback when something was achieved or responded to us closure when a job as file down and said she done yeah yes I was going to respond to the answer which I 'll circulate to everybody in the next five days of this month Thank You Jan you might be useful just starts thinking about whether that should be more public than just a feedback to counselors because I think a number of us have had several complaints about the quantity and I know that with the cracks and the footpaths and things like that that the weeds get through and I know that there 's been a lot of spraying going on and that takes a wee while to take a feat but it is an important issue that you know we 've got the eyes of the world on us and a couple of weeks time so we do want this place looking good I mean not that we don 't want it looking good all the time but as good as possible all the time Glenn thank you and thank you for your report Kelly and obviously very full report very busy over the christmas new year time i 'd like to acknowledge an and her team for their responsiveness thank you over the last week and helping to take the heat out of it which i think was actually unhelpfully amped up in some quarters won 't say anything more about that but my question is about the the capex under spender I know you you said before pets if equated that as you know could lead to possible underperformance I have a view also that it 's not possible to actually spindle it in a given financial year and I think this has a direct link unless I 'm wrong to the debt to revenue ratio so my question is to you Peter how often can we have that did to revenue ratio updates or do we have them quarterly already and the financial performance reports or could it be monthly elephant and what 's important at the moment is more the projections of where that 's going in the current performance we 're well under any particular metric now and we agree it as part of the the Treasury policy and the financing policy as part of a long-term plan so we get to set the ceiling at that level but we 've right it 's good would someone like to move that the report be received Paul lonsdale seeking to Jamie Goff I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know

all right so with somebody would somebody like to move the recommendation Vicki back sip ended Phil Clearwater all right so can we open this up for questions first yeah I 've read through the submission I guess it 's a secretary before like I know we 're saying we 've got concerns but I don 't see where we 're actually saying we 're a poster can someone just highlight where that is well I think it 's pretty fundamental yeah okay I mean the cigarettes it will the structure of the submission is designed to to make our significance of mission in accordance with our role under the local government act and I think that 's an important statement so rather than going to death to the opposed we actually have to state I believe that and taking a sustainable development approach a local authorities should take into account the social to maintain and enhance the quality of the environment and the reasonably foreseeable needs a future generation so I mean I really want that to be up front because we are actually meeting our statutory obligations and making the submission this that 's my take on others anyway my understanding from the submission is what we 're saying is the risk that simply too great and it should not be allowed to go ahead yeah because the risks are far too great yeah it 's too much uncertainty and unknown yes um and it says that and it says that on to point to the council can that the risks of deepwater offshore petroleum exploration production in these areas are too great for the reasons described in our submission yeah but it doesn 't say that we 're closer so we can amend that that 's great the other question I had was in regards to I know that we 're sending a little too james stevenson wallace visa general manager of the petroleum and minerals and MV but um could we also send this to the government ministers in it seems to me that they 're really the ones that are making the balls as we fear from the deputation i think it would be good to make sure that they 're aware of our concerns and actually ask them for a response is that something we can do we can see see it to relevant ministers i think actually sending it directly asking for a responsible people well except that it 's a request for a submission i just think that we should we should well we 're going to if we 're going to write to them and seemed a copy of it then we should actually write a separate letter saying these are the concerns that we raised and our submission we 'd be grateful of for a response on the generic issues that we 've raised particularly the issue around wider public engagement in consultation which is I presume what government in control of rather than bissonnet that agency thanks yeah Tim I was this one is an organization have we spoken to any of the local bodies in the tyranny theory which I mean of a volcano so I was just wondering about the the economic and safety measure them and it seems ludicrous to oppose deep-sea oil exploration without any without tongue proper safety mechanisms especially next to our Hector 's dolphins areas etc so but I 'm just one on the economic side of things have we made any contact with them with the gals two issues and I mean it would seem logical to me that we talk with them as well to see what the problems and issues had been and and but also if there are any benefits thank I 'm filled in our Pauline thanks for reporting the submission and my question really is can you tell us about any research which actually indicates any links between deep-sea drilling wall or fracking in effect on land and size seismic eruptions or air quakes manner that it 's done offshore I 'm not aware that there 's a link between that and seismic activity more familiar with some potential linkages between what 's called fracking and seismic events on land but in terms of the types of technologies that of it but then again I haven 't_''_324.62 I haven 't looked into that to see if there is a relationship but I guess I still be concerned that in fact of with deep sea drilling if in fact that drilling was occurring here and no especially a known fault or even an unknown fault that and when your opinion with that would that be of concern so I I couldn 't answer that question without looking into it Thank You Pauline mingling you my question was run tatiana mentioned there was a lack of a an impact assessment report is there as a possibility that we request that for now submission an impact assessment report and do you think that would be a viable son to include I mean that would write you know encompass the economic environmental all sorts of broad-spectrum impacts I would assume and just on 3.35 on page 4 05 we mentioned contingency bond would we want to put a level on net like not a specific number you know stating a significant amount so that it looks actually a serious bond not just a them thank you my I 'm also intrigued about the environmental contingency bond and my question is about how widespread the use of those are and secondly how effective the proven to be I don 't have a quick answer to that sorry but you 're I can certainly check into it but I am mindful that we are somewhat limited in terms of when we can make the submission there is a time frame what 's the deadline for it and I 'm to februari here night the febri so you know in terms of getting through their information I think we 've got to get the certain and I think you may have heard that we 'd like to have the two submissions that we had presented today attached as addendum to the submission yeah but I mean it we could have actually text for submissions that Paul some of the key key additional points into the submission itself which was the reference to climate change I think that was quite a useful addition yep Tim I just think at some stage for counselors that would be quite scenario because we know on average how many barrels are pumped per hour or whatever new zealand and we can base it off taranaki and if we look at tides etc of the cannery coast so we can in the proposed areas where they 're looking at drilling so we can get a really a better understanding of how devastating this could be if something went wrong so I think the information somewhere but I 'm not quite sure we 're I think you know in Tim that 's useful information for counselors and and maybe we want to follow that up maybe the ite committee would like to pick that up as an issue and follow up on it and get some baseline information or for counselors I think that would be useful but not to hold up the submission process I actually not yes it 's anyone else got any questions today look I just like to clarify council 's position and regard to its well I 'm coming there and regard to its responsibilities under the local government act as outlined on page one of the submission and whether in fact you know we we can say that there 's a core business for County Council I also look at the map of the Great Basin zone i do have a support for areas of the proposed block offer that fall inside the 12-mile nautical zone and about the reserve however I really want to sort of question what worth a submission is what jurisdiction what whether in fact you know people can do whatever outside this 12-mile nautical zone and whether we effectively we 're wasting our time making a submission in an area that we have no jurisdiction on perhaps also sort at the 3.17 and you know here we not take the point I think it 's time asking about what is the reaction of an area like Taranaki that has had offshore drilling for a number of years and 3.17 you know they say wild historic oil spill incidents in the air is low granted the potential is high and I wonder really whether we are just being a bit alarmist I have some quotes of quite reservations about council being involved in question for staff to answer most questions I asked about the 12-mile nautical I don 't think that it 's relevant to the issue of the submission and and so I think it is the debate that you want here but if you want to answer the 12-mile question then that 's fine I 'm not sure with the 12 miles extends to but I 'm presuming that they wouldn 't be offering they wouldn 't have a block off for anything other than 12 hours of that the northeast and always corner of the block and the rest of it us from what I can see the green area is a reserved area it 's not the 12-mile limit oh no well look at the map on page 4 13 see the 12-mile dotted line just coming in the eastern most limit of the Marine Mammal sanctuary corresponds to the 12-mile limit are you I think the issue is that oil spills don 't recognize boundaries and that 's that 's where even though my understanding is our jurisdiction goes to the mean my water springs and it 's 's right but either way I think the issue is that again oil spills don 't recognize boundaries yeah I have made this point to with the unconfined aquifers that yes it 's Eakins responsibility to monitor the water but whose responsibility is it when the water is contaminated it doesn 't respect the regulatory authority when something goes wrong and it doesn 't respect a line on a map when something goes wrong but there was a political statement so that 's my speech I don 't think there are any more questions and so now we 'll open it up for debate yani on that point though Haziq in madison wish or have we talked sorry I 've just opened it up some bait there are no questions I 'll have your department yep thank you I just really want to commend the deputations that we fed this morning I think it 's great that this council is helping to give people a voice to a process that they otherwise wouldn 't have any opportunity to raise their concerns and I have a lot of sympathy for those in the solution this is gambling with our city 's future and it 's not a gamble that I 'm prepared to take so I hope and encourage councils to support this it would be great if it was unanimous we need to send a really strong signal to government that a weave concerned about the risks associated with such activities and the risks are unacceptable and we should be opposed into we think it 's totally unacceptable that the public are completely shut out of major decisions that have been made about the future of our city of our country in a particular of our environment we 've seen that that you know the economic development at any environmental cost has been a bit of a nature that 's that 's been happening in the last few years in New Zealand and and I think it 's really important that we do particularly when you think about what we try and do a city is absolutely protect that valuable natural environment that we have that will be the future of our city for white people want to come here if you think about a fantastic coast you think about our coastal pathway that we 're currently working through you think about the things that we 're doing in other parts of the city through through the peninsula in terms of walkways this I think is a really good submission and we should be really strongly opposed to what the government are proposing I would also encourage us since I can 't ask the question but just to raise a point in by that we should be going to eco and expecting econ to be making an equally strong submission with concerns given that they should also be very concerned about what 's been proposed so yeah that 's all over let 's see okay okay clean the things done thank you I think it 's reasonable to say that in Canterbury we 've concluded that you can never say never people say that the risk here is quite low in my view the risk outweighs any tenuous game which we can see for New Zealand from the report the estimated Rena cost and this this was not from deep least inaudible was a hundred thirty million dollars that was for the fuel cargo and the ship that 's aside from any environmental effect and I don 't have any figures on a costing a hundred and thirty let that be the contingency bond or the kind of bond we put in place let 's submit on this it submits strongly and let 's ensure that our view is who entertainer I 'm strongly supportive of the content of submission I 'd like to start off this morning by thanking the two groups that have made deputations this morning for the additional information that they have brought us one of the frustrations of this for me is that once again the City Council becomes the forum for groups to make comments which really directed at the the government process and whilst there is a frustration in that new be great if people were able to have their say directly through a more open submissions process it 's good that we are able to play a role in taking that information through the government in our and submission as the counselor in the context of our unique banks peninsula environments and in particular our coastal environments and coastal landscapes the unique Hector 's dolphins and of course you know the wider environmental concerns of the proximity of what 's proposed to be allowed contiguous to our marine mammal sanctuary and the mayor certainly made the point that you know the the boundary is in water and an oil spill certainly wouldn 't respect that boundary the effects of any oil spill would be far greater for banks peninsula and for the wider area than environmental if I think of a Corolla in particular but the peninsula in general we have a tourism industry which is based on that natural environment and landscape and which is based on waterborne activities we 've got cruise ships that bring in thousands of international visitors every year through a Corolla and we 've got a local community there which in terms of its economy relies on tourism for survival the difference between a Corral in summer and in winter is significant in terms of its some economic ability and just the look and feel of result of the oil drilling that we 're talking about this morning a Corot be subject to a permanent winter and that certainly wouldn 't be a good situation so I 'm strongly supportive of the council submission and the addition of elements that we 've heard this morning into that then urge my colleagues to support it in the same way gemma scandrett thank you i 'm also on one of them on the working part of it worked I worked on this some time ago my real concern is when you put safety measures and to and to interpret to prepare them you 're ready to go this the information we 've the New Zealand has not prepared for any major oil spill it 's amazing how closest to the coast or some of these blocks are and I believe that if there were a major spill it would probably it could well cause the extinction of the Hector 's dolphin and it certainly stop our struggling inshore fishing industry I think until New Zealand especially in this proposal that we are we are truly prepared to prevent oil drilling and museum or in this area as well so thank you fergie back thank you and I think the point about the safety is absolutely key and the the wells in Taranaki are much closer to shore in fact anadarko haven 't found any deep sea oil and Taranaki yet so the risks of deep-sea oil drilling are as yet unknown in New Zealand probably our best analogy is with shell up in the up in the north sea and there are regular oil spills there are always oil spills and New Zealand 's capacity to deal with those is three small vessels who can allegedly deal with which can allegedly deal with 5,500 tons so the oil has to be incredibly well-behaved and stay only at 5,500 tons and not move in the ocean with massive waves so this is a scenario that is so ridiculous when these first came to us actually the 2014 block had the oil drilling block offer actually coming through our marine mineral reserve the idea that it will stay nicely outside it and that no dolphins will ever swim into the tragic for in the event that any of that happened we 've seen and we 've seen over the last year the impact of a disaster on this city 's economy we know that the cost of that the request of recovering from that for us will be billions and it will take 25 to 30 years the cost of recovering if you look at what happened in the Gulf of Mexico and the 20th of april 2010 remember it well with that massive oil spill was all of the wealth of america and all of the american military apparatus and the American oil machine apparatus they could not contain that spell we 're expecting that the oil companies will do that themselves out of their good grace and and we have we we just the idea that we believe that 's going to happen is so wrong on so many levels for christchurch our economy and we only need to look at the figures of what goes through the port of littleton our economy is reliant on agriculture and horticulture that 's reliant on our clean water our clean that at risk for for what for an industry that we 're currently subsidizing that the price of oil has currently fallen from 108 dollars to forty-eight dollars a barrel I 'm hoping like crazy that that actually schedules us far more effectively than you never has submissions well because I hope the cost of drilling is way more than that although it is subsidized by the government and we know that there are risks on ahead cut river that we have to clean up we know that there are risks potential risks if we don 't act on our and confined aquifers we cannot allow risks to happen at sea for New Zealanders one of the highest values culturally that we put on on this country is our beaches and to put our water our entire economy at risk for some oil which actually we can 't refine in this country so even if we were looking at it in terms of our economic well-being and our energy self-sufficiency this does not do it this oil cannot be refined it the only refinery mr. gallant is so it 's the fact that we cannot as planet afford to burn or to use the fossil fuels that we already know about is very well made we simply you 're seeing that snow storms and Boston the droughts and the East Coast all of those extreme weather events much more frequently other result of climate change and we cannot afford to to advance down that track by helping accelerate it and so I think we can certainly bring us up I agree completely about the need for public consultation on this this is something that for New Zealanders is so fundamental to who we are our see that not allowing public input into it is absurd and horrible but there is just no way that this makes any economic sense nevermind the environment just for a moment although I do economically it is such high risk that it does not stack up XO thank you very well but all right social tape measure Oh David I was kind of hoping but he would get too close off here issue but I might have to I might have to re-enter the debate look I support the interview looking at the concluding remarks of the submissions I actually support the first three bullet points in terms of modifying the boundaries of the block zone but I have some difficulty with the rest of the summary in terms of the economic potential economic advantage to them to our country and the fact that we have offshore drilling s occurred in New Zealand for a number of years with minimal and low risk of sorry the low incidence of any oil spill so I can give some support to the submission but not total so I 'm not sure quite herro pair i would vote on that and maybe a way around it would be that i would vote for the submission but record my reservations the disadvantage to the economic advantage to the country yeah I look I 'm quite happy for you to do that I just want to read one sentence into the record which is while the probability of the occurrence of an adverse event may not be high the outcome of such an event can be catastrophic and that is right so i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie _"

around New Zealand where people have successfully restored and redeemed their waterways increased their fish stocks and improved biodiversity and amazing and unexpected ways I am making this deputation on behalf of the River of Life Network and have prepared this material with reverent mark gibson the coordinator of the River of Life Network the River of Life Network has been going for four years it is a faith based network that tries to play a constructive role around conservation and environmental issues in Canterbury it was one of the founding groups of the oven or takato network and has also led a number of walks along both the hip cat and the avin rivers the government in the Department of Conservation and working out appropriate areas for marine reserves marine mammal sanctuaries tire puri and Rahu II areas the River of Life Network has been working collaboratively with doc staff nighter who he can mirror and the Associate Minister of the Environment lucky Wagner to see if the whole of the Canterbury raw hay from kokoda to timaru can be prioritized by doc and work in the same way as the Otago marine protected area two-year process which is currently taking place so they 've already began on working out there marine protected area we would invite the Christchurch City Council to have some involvement with this collaboration also because a good shank of the Canterbury coastline is in the Christchurch City Council area tourists including cruise ship visitors schoolchildren travelers to Surrey students local ewee fishermen divers and locals would all benefit from the increase in numbers and species of fish once a necklace of marine reserves marine mammal sanctuaries tire puri and Rahu II areas was in place along the Canterbury coastline this region because it is an important meeting place of sub-antarctic and subtropical zones and has two history and the teeway horror Lake Ella 's Mia it has the same number of bird species as the whole of the Amazon you take no risks you don 't muck around with treasures like this you protect them and you look after them the potential risk of an accident while drilling is higher in this region because of the depth and also because of the seismic fragility the introduction of deep-sea petroleum drilling into the deep fragile seismically sensitive environment of the Canterbury coastline is potentially catastrophic for aquatic and terrestrial life and would spell doom to the marine protected areas that are in the processes process of being envisaged and developed it is not appropriate that deep sea drilling blocks from the Syria be allocated to oil companies deep sea oil drilling is extremist extraction and unnecessary the South Island can easily produce enough electrical energy to run our car fleets our businesses our farm our homes Christchurch could run solely on electrical energy why drill and the deep sea for oil that we don 't need and run the risk of destroying our most precious resource the the council for their stand on the application for the oil block and we wish to support that stand no Athena koto tena koe to do you know our tactical killer thank you very much are there any questions Yanni thank you just hit two questions one is heavy written to the minister responsible regarding your concerns and I know that the formal submission process excludes the public but have you had any response back from the ministers of the MPS who are involved in promoting this and we haven 't written directly to the minister we could do that and I think there would be something perhaps council could also do and then the second question was do you think our submission goes far enough I note you and the previous of you talked about the fact that there 's really no need for this to happen we 're kind of expressing a lot of concern in what us and asking for greater public consultation but do you think we should actually be more opposed to this whole notion of what 's happening rather than just saying well you know we were kind of we 're not we 're not saying we 're opposed to it so should release anger me we 're obviously going to have an interesting discussion about the detail of the submission which we might tune to immediately after this this item the stick potations concluded so that we can actually have that debate while you 're still in the room are there any other Glenn thank you part of our submission includes the proposal for an environmental contingency bond so I know that sounds quite reactive to be put in place before any drilling takes place it 's an upfront sum equal to the worst-case risks scenario and held as a bond by the relevant government authority until the drilling has been completed if you could have a view on that it was this something you 're just hearing a fresh I 've just heard about this limbo going to bond have your eyes hit about yeah because they 've probably talked about it come back up come back up I mean it 's it 's been generous here there 's another three minutes i think i think it was a good idea and as you say it is very reactive but if the government were to have in place a policy like that it would make it very economically unviable and very unattractive for all companies so it might have the dual effects of actually eventually yeah deterring oil exploration and the first base it goes quite a strong what do i think is a very reasonable request and certainly one that they might take into more consideration and stopping or drilling and altogether and yeah i think thank you yeah there any other questions David what 's the closest distance to shore of the Great South and Canterbury basins and block be inside the 12 more economic zone or outside of the oil block that they 're proposing oil block yeah I don 't know do you know I 've just got maps up here now but it doesn 't actually tell me if what we don 't know but what we do know is that the marine protected areas that will be considered some of them are potentially considerably large areas or 12 kilometers or whatever so I mean it 's our hope to have a connection between land and ocean and marine protected areas so there 's a flow from ocean to lend but when we are looking at protecting significant and the most ecologically significant areas of our coastline I 'm sure that the major could be significant areas that overlap in terms of areas oil companies want X is 2 and so on sorry are there any other yeah Pauline thank you for your submission father just make a quick comment in the first paragraph will you say your face both network that tries to play a constructive role around conservation and environmental issues I think you are playing a constructive how much they think you and ask you to alter lead line ok thank you very much all right so thank you very much thank you I did indicate that we would move on to item 14 _"

    "text": "how could i invite i 'm not going to pronounce this correctly i don 't thanks Jana see Anna Fitz John from oil free auto tahi regarding item 14 council 's submission proposed block offer 2015 welcome hello thank you very much and I apologize for my slightly bedraggled and parents of bike from burnside and it 's raining cats and dogs out there and soak yo to you all my name is Deanna Fitz John I 'm a drug-free graduate from Canterbury University and today i 'm representing our grassroots group or free auto tahi and we 're part of a network of groups across the country opposing deep-sea oil drilling and so ever since deep-sea oil exploration began to be pursued a few years ago we 've witnessed a number of very worrying steps taken by our government to quell the opposition to deep-sea oil exploration so the first of which was the anadarko amendment this limited our rights protest at sea within a certain amount i think 500 metres of a seismic survey vessel or deep sea oil rig the second one and was passing a law non notified discretionary activity and so this ensured that the public were excluded from the consultation process we were unable to submit against proposed areas or launch formal opposition to those exploration areas so these are very systematic attempts to shut down opposition and proceed with a fossil fuel agenda regardless of the public concerns so the only parties now left that have been consulted erie harper and of course the local councils so we would like to really commend the council for opposing the 2015 oil and gas block offers in particular we really want to thank the council for urging the government to undertake broader public consultation on the issue so your submission also highlighted the risks posed to our marine environment our coastal communities vulnerable vulnerability in an oil spill the proximity of the exploration Ares the marine mammal sanctuary and so these are all really excellent reasons and we would like to slightly elaborate on those reasons and provide some further reasons why oil exploration will negatively impact Canterbury so first of all opening up these areas for oil and gas exploration exposes them to huge the form of seismic ocean blasting so this is the first phase of oil exploration and it involves a 2d in a 3d survey so there 's a massive sonic blasts that being let out and to penetrate the ocean floor and basically send back information of what lies beneath the surface so this has the potential to cause physical harm to marine animals and close proximity to the survey vessel it can also damage cetaceans which are whales and dolphins by impacting their ability to use sonar to feed navigate and communicate with one another so there is very little is known about the fulham impacts of seismic surveying on marine on the marine environment so we feel that there should have been rigorous studies undertaken and detailed impact assessment reports submitted before unprecedented areas of our ocean were opened up for seismic testing because there are now studies coming out and to detail the harm done to marine mammals during this process and also opening up our coast to export to your drilling obviously opens them up to the risks that something will go catastrophic the wrong so greatest statistical chance of a blowout so as you mentioned in your submission New Zealand is utterly unprepared to deal with a normal spoke and so our spill response at the moment consists of three vessels and that are unfit for any kind of action and open water a relief well would be weeks away because they 'd have to bring it from somewhere else in the world and the first line of defense of New Zealand zorz bill is corrects it so there are a number of problems with all of these defenses and first of all in the gulf of mexico they were in an area that had the highest concentration of relief wells in the world and that took them months to block up that hole and they also had thousands of response vessels and they also use correct as a first line of defense and that had massive implications for the community afterwards because corrects it has corrects it as a very toxic material its carcinogenic it puts oil into the water column which means you 're unable to see it but that doesn 't mean of these threats of the exploratory drill or seismic surveying is a severe threat to marine life and we 're actually nullifying the effects of having a marine mammals sanctuary on banks peninsula and because this sanctuary cannot prevent dolphins and whales from entering out of that sanctuary and entering into areas where they may be impacted by seismic surveying or drilling and of course a mammal sanctuary does not prevent oil travelling from any sort of spell event and to the marine mammal sanctuary and so these rest to a marine environment translate into severe economic risks to industries that rely on a healthy marine environment and such as tourism and fishing industries banks financial area and a corona in particular very vulnerable to these economic effects so deep sea oil drilling increases the economic vulnerability of those ocean reliant areas and it decreases the community resilience so I went over to the a Corolla community and to talk to some of the business owners there just to make them aware of what was going on and I got the sense that a lot of them were very worried economic and you know their livelihoods strongly rely on a healthy and sound marine ecosystem to continue that because of the tourism of the fisheries in fact that so many local residents from Christchurch and everything are going over and putting money into their community simply to enjoy and be around that pristine ecosystem so oil exploration increases New Zealand 's economic vulnerability in the event of a spell so taxpayers are going to be largely liable for a cleanup I think when anadarko was drilling down here they were they were covered for about 30 million dollars which is negligible and to the costs of cleaning up an oil spill that would cost billions of dollars and that payer would have to front it not only that we haven 't really considered the severe ongoing economic losses after us major spill event so in the Gulf of Mexico it numbered into the billions of US dollars and because they were basically having to cover the costs of loss to fisheries lost to tourism and those ecosystems will never recover I also wanted to mention that in 2010-2011 Christchurch went the ongoing psychological and social impacts of that major disaster and so residents already feel like their cultural heritage has been lost partly due to the loss of met some of our culturally important buildings and because our voices have been to an extent shut down in the rebuild of Christchurch so now we 're opening up our coastlines to a very different kind of disaster and this one is one that threatens our natural heritage and so cities can be rebuilt that ecosystems will never recover from a severe oil spill such as foreseen in the gulf of mexico and so Cantabrians value the ocean for and the coastlines for food and recreation not only is there a strong economic reliance on the ocean but there 's also a very deep emotional connection and Reliance as well so the intrinsic value of our oceans and emotional connection isn 't subject to easy analysis and an impact assessment report for example however it 's one of the most important things that we would be putting at risk by these operations so the grief wat by an oil spill on our and to be honest I think Cantabrians have been through enough and earthquakes are unavoidable but oil spills aren 't and there would be one hundred percent avoidance of an oil spill if we were to disallow and these operations to continue in our waters so deep sea oil drilling also impacts our cultural identity so I know that New Zealanders have a very strong sense of pride in our and being an environmentally progressive nation and oil exploration off the coast makes us all inadvertent accomplices to an industry renowned for its abysmal environmental record and the new oil and gas block offers demonstrate our governments can to a dying industry over its commitment to the wishes and wants and needs of New Zealanders so finally I wanted to touch on climate change the elephant in the room and it wasn 't mentioned in the council 's submission but it is i think something to be very severely considered in allowing our coast to be opened up to oil and gas exploration because reports coming out of the IPCC in the general scientific consensus worldwide is that we can that means leaving eighty percent of known reserves in the ground if we are to avoid runaway climate change and that 's a conservative estimate I 'd imagine so these oil exploration activities they 're not only reckless on the local scale because of the rest is supposed to our local environment they 'll so reckless on a global scale because the impacts of climate change are only going to get worse and we 're only going to see more severe ramifications worldwide so as an exam that I can 't and you know I can 't ratify the any kind of justification for exploring for more fuel reserves when we had neighbors and the Pacific Islands who stand to lose their home home culture due to sea level rise we can 't_''_589.13 be out there exploring for more fuel reserves when we know that they are you know subject to huge ramifications from climate change and it 's just immoral really and so New Zealand is fast becoming the final frontier for the fossil fuel industry we 're locking ourselves into a home missing future and with foregoing a transitioning to and so this really makes us very unresisting our way so my generation will probably have to pay brunt of our government 's failure to prepare new zealand for the impacts of climate change and prepares for the global economic changes that we 're going to see relying on fossil fuel industry and it 's just going to make us very vulnerable in the short term and long term so in conclusion I want to thank the council for representing us when we 've been silenced and ignored by our government oil exploration without consultation is insulting and it demonstrates a disregard for our community I want to sincerely thank you for speaking out on path of Canterbury ins and our environmental interests it 's obvious to us that you are sensitive to the needs of our community and our marine ecosystems thank you very much thank you very much and oh sorry I should turn my microphone on give them that advice to everyone else and ignored it thank you very much for coming and making that submission it 's always good to you know have that to add to our submission so we might be able to if you 've got that in writing yeah might be quite useful if you if you could forward that to us i think but he 's kind of leading the way on the submission so if you could forward a copy to cancel button will make sure that the that the points that you 've raised that haven 't been raised and our submission are included as well so that there is a voice to to what you 've been able to present so thank you very much thank you thank you and now we have kathleen gallagher _"

design guides and I just ask that year of the relevant committee isla to give you a copy of the amended resolution which may address some of your concerns yeah so I will hand over to you thinking thank you very much i 'm making the step you taken cerned about the process being proposed in a report this morning to counsel to progress the development of the major cycleway routes with particular regard to appreciate Rock I will be speaking as a member of the higley ferry me to community board but not on behalf of the whole board as the additional information presented in the report before you today was not known until the email from Peter Mitchell last Friday and the heavy ferry meet community board doesn 't lead to next Wednesday of relevance I am a resident in the affected area i live in chelsea street and i 'm a community representative of the estuary trust as the charles with reserve as impacted i 'm a member of the lynnwood village master-planned community advisory group and i have a cobweb covered work in my sheet which indicates i also fit into the target market of interested but consumed I 'm also a trained site traffic management supervisor that 's the esteem is sign on the back of road work staff my qualification is left but i expect the principal driver for the qualification remains to cause the least inconvenience to the traveling public in last Thursday 's press in explaining the doubling of the budget for cycleways it was reported that the former council envisaged 13 cycleways would be largely on road requiring just lines and green paint on the roads in fact the concept of the now named Rapa Nui cycleway was anything but back then it was proposed to run the cycle way up the existing pathway along the lynnwood drain from Charles with reserve at the end of them would Avenue to cross odd ones road and then purchase land from to run the pathway across to wooster street of the major development work required on the pathway owing to earthquake damage but also widening and the cost of meeting cepted guidelines along the length of it including Glenwood Park then there was the land costs so we recommend a going around Humphries drive up the lynnwood paddocks side of linwood avenue a barnes dance across the dyers road run straight up the middle of Glenwood Avenue through the trees through the linwood avenue old ones Buckley 's and section and onto aidan side drives where it would eventually link up with the haven Oh to Cairo cycleway with an exit to a normal cycle lane it was the street the next time the heck we fear make Community Board sees the planned route is the current board and the roots no longer up the lynnwood drain but some various tubing developments and in advance of the 17th of November community board briefing I authored the paper Center each of you in response to Peter Mitchell 's assertion that community boards have made no recommendations my first concern was that the proposed route around the side of Charles with drive and out onto dies road the heavy traffic Ring Road bypass for the port now if you look at page 300 of your council papers page 11 of attachment 7 you will see that very map the map refuse at the bottom to option one is being considered to meet the desired outcome but the narration on page 14 has changed to route two straight through Charles with reserve which on the twenty-fourth of October was coded red is not able to achieve the desired outcome in any way so how come option two is now the preferred one and the risk to delivery column states that this option to it needs to mitigate settee dishes or provide alternative winter night route so why not provide an effective route from the outset following the 17th October briefing of the staff promotion of route to I sent an email and Eric banks senior network planner for parks responded and his response included an opinion from Android crossland who 's the park ranger and internationally respected ornithologist however from a wildlife management perspective n from a user conflict minimization perspective to west of the band trek would separate bikes and people put bikes well away from wildlife and is the most direct route through the reserve so anyway needst from charles with reserved as proposed route goes up the left-hand side of the lynnwood drain canal along an existing walkway but proposes to take out vegetation to mitigate sick tiered issues those are the poplars and Hawthorne hedges providing shelter shade and screening from them whatever new an amenity value for residents in the subdivision coming out of Lynwood park its proposed to have signalized crossing over the Ottomans road to Marlborough Street that 's across a major subjects a bourbon arterial route in less than a block away from the linwood avenue intersection the route then Wiggles around the scenic back streets of philipstown and numbered to worcester street via tinkered street and that will require taking out street parking and on the corner of tankard street and Wooster Street is the only on street parking outside under the read of a render its claimed the Rapa Nui shade while NCR will enhance the limit the village master plan well can assure you that it won 't it 'll take out on street parking and they will further hinder the development of this very sorry suburban center in conclusion I have issues with at least three choke points from traffic management point of view cyclus safety in at least one area at Leimert Park negative impact on residents immunity and businesses along the route and even further cost increases is the reality of managing those issues is accounted for I suspect this whole process to date has been rushed through to make to long-term plan how can the Rapa Nui sheetrock cycleway have doubled in cost when the previous community boards recommendations will have saved the council hundreds of thousands if not millions and development and land purchase cost the proposal before you today I believe is to workshop the one predetermined NCR route and that will be the Rapa Nui sheetrock so kawaii you have before you the floors I 've outlined to you aren 't huge the project team if the council approves the delegated decision made into the ite committee this same route design will come back for public consultation it 's a route I believed to have serious flaws and that would be an embarrassment to go to the public with surely I would like to see an independent audit on the viability of the Rapa Nui route in the creation of an integrated development plan for cycleways including the heathcott expressway a power hood river route over now to cara route is psycho ways connections in the east orbital cycle way i believe there are risks inherent in the rubbery cycleway plan you see today and therefore in the proposal to delegate the decision-making least of all to democracy and i hope that i have demonstrated some of those to you thank you thank you there any questions he 'll think Zoila like you 'll be aware from the amendments that opened and we 've indicated to you that there 's more specific detail on how community rules would be involved in I take it from from these two that would allow for example this process would allow community boards to put forward another option another suggestion like you have just outlined to us now that might be workable because I do understand that the council staff have worked through some of the options with you including like for example you reach and hear what here at bank said them hasn 't put into it as one staff member but my main question really is here do now that in fact that is clear that other options could be explored by a community board because that actually relate actually assist your concerns I don 't believe it will and the reason why I don 't believe it well is that the concerns that I have and I can only speak for myself personally but I can think others head to around the table but their concerns that I have a very serious and they have been presented on several occasions to staff and ignored and I have no confidence in the clause that says here noting the road selections as detailed below will be subject to receiving recommendations for the affected community board my recommendations have already been presented and they 've been ignored and so then your recommendations are not the boards initially they the last tube in at the moment I believe a little was rushing to premiere and the chief executive at the end of last year I haven 't personally seen it expressing our concerns but hey sorry and Paul just to clarify you 've sent these recommendations they wish you went by our chairperson initially when I prepared the my opinions which I seen to you and everybody on the community board I also asked community board advisor to send it to staff in advance of the briefing on 17th of october when thing is I suppose going by the chairperson it though she does represent the board 's use I think that I had made the point that I 've received a letter from the chair of the community board which I 'm happy to table with this meeting basically saying that the community board discussed information and a memorandum on the cycleway the board decided to write to advise of the additional information the board 's ongoing concerns regarding the root of the Rapa Nui to share growth cycle way through Charles with Charles with wetlands resumed so specific route through the reserve area members have expressed concern at the proposals and support for the community to be able to have input into these roots acknowledging the community boards are not part of a decision making on the route selection so this will involve both public engagement and also now through their involvement of the community boards what we 're going to be considering today is an approval in principle rather than the specific you know detail of the route and the design all right thank you very much I really appreciate you coming today _"

    "text": "it would be the bus taking priority on turning in front of them I 'm satisfied that there is a full range of view and that staff have taken into account that by ensuring that cyclists are ahead of the bus at the Internet the intersection where the bus will have its own lane so it 's not going to be caught up and traffic the way it has been which is one of the reasons why you get the accumulation of buses as we used to and having its own separate lane it will be able to see clear in front of it it will require somebody deliberately trying to run the light to get in front of a bus without being able to be seen and I guess on that basis I support the staff recommendation Phil well look I just want to say that yep like David and most other other people on the transport infrastructure and environment committee we 've been across this for some time and I think actually it 's a bit rich to ask for more explanation around the other options like for us very clear information why they would starters I also think it 's about retro count for with due respect for counselors to ask for further information when they were absent from from the information this morning which was set down the agenda and that is an example of why in fact you can 't carry on delaying everything indefinitely the city will get nowhere if we take that approach what I think would be helpful because clearly that it is this is this is not easy stuff for us as laid people to understand I think that a workshop for all councillors and all interests of parties around the option and it isn 't this one it is in fact that what the staff recommend that then in effect will be very helpful and I would urge counts us to attend that so that we all gain that information because we are all going to have to talk with our residents and our cyclists and I 'm one of them so there are there are the staff have already pointed out the set the serious implications of the everly their what it doesn 't say is if we adopt if we adopt if we were to go that way where the rest of those cycle lanes we would end up work on to em straight where they would be and quite in terms of the safety so far that we have there 's no question that they would still be on the north side so for safety for cyclists you know cycles swinging from one side to the other across to industry well you know that is just unconscionable and so I urge counselors to vote against the amendment and to support the staff recommendation I I want to applaud the high level of expertise that and in terms of advice that we 've been given today thank you thank you alright well I shall put them in a cheers sorry to interrupt i 'll just raise a couple process type issues excuse me and just if councillors wherever mind to defer to M Street it would be complicated for us to do that because the resolutions are and related so we 'd probably need to go away and would be the case could you also give us some direction as to what other information you 'll be seeking from us if we were to come back at another time and report back to council and be good to get some direction on there I think we 'll deal with that after the after the fact so i will put the amendment all those and favors well i think we just vote on the on the machine it 's probably yep so that 's um that 's lost so now i will put the the recommendation and again we can vote yeah we 'll vote we have voted we 've debated it no we 'd wind i said we debate the both of them together that 's what i 've made it absolutely clear right from the start yeah that 's carried so thank you thank you very much for your work now we move on to the next ten you yep we can go to look at that yeah thank you right um we move on to the Dudley Creek paper _"

before we come to well actually we might as well have a mover and a seconder so that we can and then we 'll open it up I think I 'll start with the presentation questions and then the debate so would you like to move that and who would like to second that david east right so a pep scan I hand over to you first perhaps to give us a bit of a walk through I think probably the most significant are showing here is the location of the cycle way down charm straight which becomes one way with two east so X if we could start there peps I 'll just start with a bit of an overview of the projects per se and the consultation we 've gone through then hand over to mr. chesebro he can give us a bit more of a detailed explanation of if that 's arrived by you madam chair yes that 's fine so the council meeting on the 11th of timber council endorse consultation to be undertaken on the draft concept designs for four projects and these are all included to give effect to the first phase transport projects of an accessible City the changes relate to colombo street from here for its street to some esav and that 's really about making that a more pedestrian and cycle friendly as it sits within the slow core and will help support development and around that area the two weighing of litchfield street from Durham to Manchester Street and essentially as the mirrors just referenced the one Wayne or the continuing one way I 'm Wayne of tuam street from Durham through to Barbados so those are the three key components that we went out and consulted on from the 17th of September to the 8th of October as you would have heard there were a few issues that that came up the proposed location of the cycleway is one of the key ones as it relates to the proposed bus a couple of other issues which I 'd like to touch on pets until before we get into the substantive debate on that issue other issues that came up were in relation to the loss of one street car parking and particularly the the timing of car parks ip5 SP 60s that sort of thing and we 've subsequently gone back in met with the majority of people who 've raised issues in relation to that and look to resolve those issues in terms of the timing and location of car parks adjacent to existing and proposed activities so I think we 've managed to address most of the concerns raised in relation to car parking the other key issue was at the moment if you 're going along Litchfield Street hitting in an east direction at the moment the left him in to Colombo is currently technically band but but everyone does it anyway and what we 've gone out and consulted on was really reintroducing Orion putting that band back in we received quite a bit of Correspondence in relation to that and subs we meet with some band being put in place we 've come to an agreement which they 're pretty comfortable with which would be essentially enabling will continue to enable private vehicles left turning from litchfield street and to colombo street north for a period of time until such time that essentially a rich field street or similar type car park is introduced so that was one of the other major issues that was raised by submitters and I think we 've mitigated their concerns by the proposal that would put in front of council so the other substantive issue is the location of the proposed cycleway on to M Street and I 'll hand over to Tim for that other than to say that we 've certainly been through an exhaustive process in relation to it it 's not a recommendation that will put before council lightly and we also have a couple of the safety auditors who the ite committee will be familiar with but we 've got them here as well if the council wants safety audit advice and they 're the ones who have provided us with the advice as right now I 'll hand over to mr. cheese bread to give you a bit of an overview of them encourage it thank you madam chair accessible City proposes as a number of part of a number of the transport proposals in it a network of separated cycleways key cycleways across the central city and into the central city to protect them all nervous cyclists from adjacent traffic that was a very strong point of feedback council received back in 2011 through share an idea many many people came to us and said we consider cycling every day in the central city and across Christchurch if we delivered a network of separated cycleways so very early on in the preparation of an passable city proposals were put into the draft plan to deliver a network of key cycle routes not on every street in the central city but key cycle routes into and across the central city that were largely separated from traffic in parallel with that council of course has been proposing a network of citywide major cycle routes again largely separated from traffic on most of those facilities of key cycle routes in the central city was to achieve a seamless network of facilities across the city for nervous inexperienced pedal cyclists to be able to come into the city and travel across the city on largely separated facilities so the considerations always around the children street proposal and others in the central city have been the design width and general quality and appearance of those facilities should be generally similar but the cyclist experience across the city and we are looking again as I stress at more nervous in experienced cyclists there are particular challenges and how cyclists deal with intersections it 's okay to separate cyclists from traffic as they 're traveling along a road but the key issue is when they get to intersections how do they handle the maneuvers at them most importantly the key aspect of all of these facilities was simplicity how do we achieve designs and usage of this facility there is inherently simple and intuitive for any cyclist to use so we turn to chew and strengthen the issue that we have before us today chew and streets one half of the central city to deliver that level of separation for Quest 's the the precincts in the existing and new central city it 's intended to service and anchor projects it 's intended to service variously the hospital the justice and emergency services precinct where we 're expecting a lot of cycle parking in there to service the 1500 staff and people that will be there the bus interchange itself where it is a transport interchange there will be in cycle facilities storage lockers and racks within the building I think for about 80 cyclists travel to and from cpit campus on the eastern part of the southern central city the eastern part of the retail precinct and the South crane so there are a number of major facilities lying along that southern part of the city very early on in the preparation of an accessible City we looked at a number of route options to deliver that east-west route Litchfield 's and a number of these have been recently revisited in the ably report that counselors have before you that 's recently been commissioned by Environment Canterbury on looked at given that we took as a given the idea of taking cyclists off of morehouse Avenue it 's fifty sixty thousand vehicles a day we consider that completely incompatible with the proposals we 're looking at here so that was dismissed as a viable option very early on so he looked variously at litchfield streets and as richard has just said we had to pre-existing parking buildings of litchfield Street beforehand and as the retail precinct appeared in the blueprint the recovery plan we it was reasonable for us to assume that there would be significant parking facilities on litchfield street and the recovery plan had proposed it going to work so for those very reasons the sheer volume of traffic we might expect in and out of two major parking buildings and with a road that was too way we considered it would be a real challenge for us to deliver separated facilities on ditchfield street we then looked at the South frame the issues with the South frame are that at the very western end there are obviously a number of land holdings around the health way through from Adly park at one end through right through the innovation precinct to cpit at the other end and there are other laneway and land holding complications within it within the innovation precinct as well the primary traffic problem with the South frame leaving aside the land issues is actually that the South frame is only 100 meters north to south and and so to deliver a good standard of facility for cyclists wishing to travel end-to-end through it which a number of these journeys will be was that they have to keep stopping stopping at every individual north south street and we only have a hundred metres to deliver a nice safe crossing for them at those locations and so there were a number of safety and traffic flow complications in delivering that so that we then turned our attention to some asif and chewin streets so the proposal in the plan was for the westbound facility to be placed on s 'en acid street where a lot of cyclists are already traveling along there at the moment anyway on the left-hand side of traffic is as at chu and straight and we have a joint technical panel between counsel and sierra staff that looks at all of this and because of the blueprint location of the interchange on the northern side of children street our immediate early designs for Choo M Street did in fact a scar design team to look at the facility exactly as council is being requested to buy submitters today to consider the facility on the south side of children street because of that interaction with the interchange so we asked the council 's design team who are designing these projects to start the design by looking at a southside facility onto and street fortuitously that is the same design as who are actually working for council at the moment on the delivery of the major cycle routes network so they knew what we were looking for in terms of the quality and the safety of the facilities they raised a number of concerns with a southside facility back to the joint technical panel those were primarily either in their view delivering an eastbound facility on the south side of chew em choose naturally as in most of their journeys to be on the left-hand side of traffic so we were asking them for through this one facility to be traveling on the right hand side of traffic and on the non intuitive side so that immediately creates an inconsistency in their view with the rest of the major cycleway network and all of the cycleways in the central city where intuitively all of the facilities are naturally on the left-hand side there were then worries about the complexity of how cyclists would travel through the intersections of Montreal Durham Colombo and Manchester streets if cyclists were on the wrong side of the traffic and on the non-intuitive right hand side particular problems there are for those cyclists small in number but who were wishing to still turn left into the Central City destinations including as of the justice precinct the interchange itself where cycle parking is provided and into the retail precinct and the other activities to the north albeit that there were other activities proposed to the south there 's a general truism in safety terms about safety in numbers is borne out by the statistics that dr. shane turner has looked at for us that is actually the rarity of that left-hand turn potential left-hand turn across those intersections and cyclists that might get a bit frustrated waiting for signals to change that they might just give it a go and turn left beyond the fact that it 's actually a very complicated maneuver so the delivery of the cycle network citywide arm which will come with the intuitive change of delivering separated cycleways people will get used to very quickly using separated cycleways where when they get too sick intersections and they want to turn right I will travel ahead join the right turn lane and then travel on from there and that 's will happen citywide as it 's happened in every other city worldwide given that most of them travel on the other side of the road but every city worldwide people cyclus using separated facilities get into the habit of traveling ahead and then turning right is a very safe maneuver and can be dealt with very simply with signals we could not deliver that dilemma as a joint technical panel at that point because our design engineers had actually said to us they recommended to us that their view was that they were requesting permission to look again at the Northside facility and put it past the front of justice and the interchange because of the magnitude of that decision the joint technical panel asked for our design team to pull together an independent workshop specialists so these were people that would worked on a major cycle route network they were signal design engineers there were safety engineers and there was they were joined by dr. Glenn Corey at the University of Canterbury was spoken to council in the past on behalf of spokes and they looked at a number of pros and cons of do we do this facility on the south or the north side of chew and straight and some of the specialists involved in that initially started that conversation from the point of view of preferring the southside facility at the end of that workshop which I didn 't attend but at the end of the workshop their conclusion was facility providing that we considered suitable design and remedial mitigation measures across the front of the interchange and the justice precinct and so the process has then followed on from there in terms of the designing of the the two key access crossings arm into the justice precinct and the interchange itself so madam chair that is really the background to the the the proposal to put the cycleway on the north side that is summarized in the papers that I believe you have yes that Richards just reminded me and also as you 'll see summarized within your papers including the ably report for Environment Canterbury on behalf the joint technical panel we 've had a number of independent safety audits carried out both on the three traffic schemes you have before you this morning but a specific focus within those on the cycle route facility itself and then further detailed examinations and safety audits are the interchange access arrangements so sorry the if we got diagrams that yes absolutely yeah on that i 'm hoping the staff have got it i 'm sorry the table that came to a memorandum which richard seemed to us will stay between open the limbo that 's less Holub trap so so there there are counselors are just receiving a diagram that spatially looks at some of the conclusions of that workshop the the the red block so a broadly Matsui on one side of a sheet it shows the north side facility and the other side of the street that shows the south side so i guess it perhaps if we start with the south side so as you can see there and these were the these were the broad outcomes from the workshop so the broad issues there were on the south side the number of conflict points which is not the only issue we 've been tackling with this but potentially there are a larger number of accesses across that cycle way on the southern side due to the provisions of the South frame planning framework and the expected number of land uses and businesses there as I 've just summarized for Council the second box there is about the level of necessary controls to deliver the level of engineers are design engineers engineers have advised to deliver a really safe facility at those key main road intersections we may be looking at a four or five phase signal arrangement so in other words it takes within the 80 seconds or so that traffic signals click around and everyone gets their go at an intersection we may need five cycles most of the site signal cycles in the central city are two phases summer three and it is that simplicity again one one approach gets the go next approach gets they go and maybe we have a pedestrian cycle within it and it 's quite simple in this case in order to deliver all of those safe cycle movements we were being advised that we may need four or five phases of signals now cyclists traveling along there then in an 80 second signal cycle might only get 12 seconds in eighty to make their move safely and so another worry about that in is risky behavior that people get to the point when they 're not prepared to wait for the next green signal and make their move I think as members can see there are certain issues around then legibility connections to various precincts north and south of the corridor and the south side option so you can see a number of red boxes I general disadvantages it 's not all black and white with these things it 's it 's you know there are there are nuances within a number of these but broadly the issue shown green there we broadly favored that the south side work well for and obviously good connections to the south frame and most importantly as far as those issues before council today most importantly it moved the matter away from the interchange entrance if that was the only issue we were concerned about the interchange entrance were then obviously that that that score was very well coming over the page then on the on the northern side then I think as counsel can see there there are from that workshop and from the further analyses a number of a larger number of green boxes there and not a larger number of issues where the Northside facility favors our cycle safety far as the matter in before council today number five there the disadvantage of that of course is that it needs a solution to the interchange entry um yeah so so hopefully everyone has that thing are you going to carry on yeah so um so at that point madam chairman we then started to focus on how could we provide appropriate mitigation at the bus bus exchange entry point and at that point and the draft designs of the interchange itself we were not proposing signal control so it would have worked quite simply as the old interchange did accessed off of Litchfield street in other words buses would have entered there across the footpath and into the the interchange so because this issue was raised the subsequent designs are now are for signaled entry both on the chin street entries of the interchange and indeed on the Litchfield Street entrance as well which carries classes to and from Manchester Street they 're effectively two intersections two simple intersections that cyclists and pedestrians will be required to yield to entering buses from to and street at that point but and 50 buses an hour entering at that point so probably one bus with in each city psychol entering there it is a very simple standard signaled arrangement for that interchange entry and I think Richard is distributing some images for you at the moment of what that looks like it is a very simple layout the key beneficiaries of some of this process madam chair have actually been pedestrians the previous interchange arm had pedestrian safety problems that the contraflow bus lane the environment can 't_''_1607.19 be raised with Council yesterday which was counterintuitive because we had a contraflow bus lane coming through to the Colombo Street intersection I 'm sure many members will remember that a small number of crashes there between buses and pedestrians no crashes between buses and cyclists that the crashes were actually at the Colombo chewin at the Colombo litchfield Street intersection where pedestrians were stepping into the road not expecting a bus coming at them from the left-hand side is almost the same issue that is was in our mind in in not favoring the south side cycle facility because again like that of this as I say have been actually in many respects pedestrians because we do have now fully signal control accesses that will safely enable pedestrians and people with mobility impairments to cross both the litchfield choose these entrances and so all of the designs which are still being fine now and all of the safety audits of those up work on that basis _"

    "text": "we 've added it down but basically they can see all options really be sure you make the hydraulic flow of all you go into action with recent banging on me so the shortest routes going to do with this the wireless a pond water doesn 't hardly more response to the hydraulic radius a so we 've got two options on the conversation wondering whether we 've got to us often recommended here all we 've got the option of going through the fruit of Scotland around the ground we have gone from open a channel and a lot of these potatoes are more resilient solution and we 've also enabled us to go around the cricket ground because if we go through again a lot more expensive things like that but one option will you put this also between one on the other and routine about any life 5 million dollars for out of 29 because my issue while we issue is i think we 've also got a whole Palace emissions p with the bottom basin one in to actually make some progress on it my worry can hear those two options we have got the judgments report he goes through a number of options we eliminated options swim for those lower options because they are all part of other disappointments so they can give Christ up and we have looked at fourteen different options so I wonder whether the council 's decision there 's a lot more information on that the comparison between option exam one or two really associates two options I think that the tea that we are favoring you want to say go away talk the landowners of option to enviable we are beautiful tribal you guys under so those are the wheel too often to the trade-off and will you trade offers balaji accent reasonably and I actually don 't want to bring the backhoe life and never break though if you were wanting another report and further options and more comparison allow you to give them some time to do it so yeah I suppose so we could go away and see whether option please is really yes go on highlight the discussion is around the landowner p.m. nappy head to we think so yes that 's my dad april and i think that they generally we 've got quite a few of the most of the line we haven 't signed anything of course no but we have had that but we 're taking none of that with that other words so that 's what the delay is usually known as a smaller group so i just wonder if you were me towards option well rather than rather than referring to the the named you know because liaison with a parks kind of interesting but if you commence the a 's and liaison with the landowners to facilitate option B and report back to council by match 2015 yeah and also to ask Dave about the date March is that too soon you want me to bring you back and so we 've got 15 landowners a happy year and queen that are whatever because there was a comparison and the Jacobs report to those trees environment window goes through the trail off they go through the costume Titans already and so I 'm just trying to work out like give you the ticket I 'll come back but I 'm not sure ok know that sir I weekly your favorite option why are you saying goes there 's no we know that but at the moment the way I see it is we don 't have enough detail about that option B to be able to either vote for it or against it so we kind of not quite ready to choose an option so I think we need to help we want to know if all those parties are going to be agreeable and some more accurate costumes that I think is it a new summer yeah extranet see that we go there we go with option B now I don 't know it 's something we haven 't discussed yeah the thing is that if there 's no barriers to be which 9.5 would tell us I would favor that because I even though the money 's great oh it 's around ten percent more of the total cost of apology that 's I can 't bring myself to sanction cutting down mature trees in removing a the city Dean 's bush somewhere in boston and being said I think it 's natural heritage and it 's a it 's a big front page test the level of confidence around the the difference in the price now we be clear that the the 29 and 30 for is just from the banks from the banks Avenue components so that the total projects are still 48 yeah the five million would push that up to 53 so that 's what we 're talking about then what 's the confidence around the 53 the Rangers we 're feeling that the 20 sorry the 48 million is the upper bound cost estimate from for that option so we still had carried that minus 10 plus 30 through on that but as the 48 is the pass to the end of that so up to 48 million is written in the report and so we would be looking expending five million dollars more maybe on a list of some but it 's still 5 million dollars and there are still other people who are flooding elsewhere and the city and the money to do things for those people it amazes me we sort of have a put out of figure here minus 10 plus 30 sort of thing and that 's putting a signal out really but we 're authorizing expenditure up to 53 by talking about mean the the top abstraction community are looking there that they 're going to price the thing around what you 're saying and whereas it could be probably done with them so cheaper we didn 't have the money money flag there already five million to that 's the other thing and is that related primarily to digging the hole in the ground is that what that relates to especially the business the Dudley Creek as a channel which I would be widening you have to make the create that same capacity at the same depth at a level from a level of existing ground so you have to remove all that material to get the hydraulic grade to work so you have much greater volume of excavation along that alternate alignment so through Marian college and the reefs so we looked using like-for-like same sort of in here in uncertainties well then the difficulty is I mean yeah it 's kind of elephant on the room stuff but you know there are issues that have been raised which would suggest that there might be other risks that we 're not factoring unto the cost assessment and one of them as time and you know that I guess all I wanted at the beginning of this process was to was to get and I mean the beginning of this part of the process was to have confidence that we could proceed you know with was something that wouldn 't get held up by other processes a long way and if I 'm making sup myself reasonably clear and that 's a that 's a factor that we haven 't had any analysis of and it 's almost difficult to take it into account I actually wonder whether we could refer this report to strategy and planning mix Thursday with power to act so that the analysis around those other points could actually be included and the paper yeah well we there is a risk a council and many respects we don 't have any choice about you know sort of setting aside a required consultation process and I 've heard enough from counselors to know that there is that there is a considerable degree of nervousness of proceeding down the preferred option that we consulted on based on the on the consultation the response from the consultation and I think there is a desire to have a look at this other option and a little bit more detail before we make a final decision but you know it 's kind of almost like caught between a rock and a hard place because I don 't know which interests might be pretty effective by the decision to go down the second track and so therefore we wouldn 't want to make even an unprincipled decision because if we did we might get undermined without having that advice so I mean can we refer this to the so yeah ah could we okay craft it up of a nine we could craft it up overnight so so that 's what we 'll do for when we that there was some positively bit illegal about requesting Lee an option being investigated yeah I 'm going to have to go so I was going to close the meeting at five o 'clock but that 's not going to happen i 'll i 'll ask the Dixie chair to take the chair and will be recommencing at eight usually in the morning right ok can I suggest something and and that is that what basically what Dave said that in 9.5 we commence liaison with the landowners to facilitate option B and F option B is viable and proceed with option B well my justification of the viability is that the additional price is five million dollars but the price of keeping and natural reserve in the city of how many extra trees two hundred as well over five million dollars in a part of the city that actually needs it I also think it may have some bitter legal outcomes then proceeding down begzare and so I 'm willing to investigate that completely so that we have completely looked at all the options if there is viable then actually proceed with that but I 'm not sure how others are feeling I 'm getting nods from booooored biggest essentially the alteration to my movement yep so that would mean Dave can you suggest in terms of the bit that you wanted a 9-5 commence liaising with the landowners to facilitate option B and if option B is doable or whatever the word is viable proceed to undertake that oh ok Dave could you actually come back to us by march as Pauline as suggested with whether option b is viable in terms of the landowners just the landowners could I can I make a suggestion just just float this for what it 's worth yeah it would be really great to have a decision for the people of Dudley to know maybe um to get the auction be off the line we 've got to be a can 't say yet let 's let 's go the the the purple root Marian college as our preferred option it would have to be subject to further consultation with the affected landowners that being the case then that that remains with an RFP and get that to market even before march yes no traffic totally the wording you want ok subject to the successful conclusion of consultation with the landowners we 're doing this too quickly or too quickly yeah don 't think anybody and flopped and Wallach uses a bit but can I just have the legal advice solutely mmmm oh uh if it 's if it 's a decision to fertile tomorrow that 's fine I mean that but I think we 're people are relying on us to make a decision sure yeah and will be guided by the legal views and makes a decision takes the first steps that are necessary gets the era of peace out but the part naps not there may change from option ater option be subject to your reporting back or whatever on the viability are you looking comfortable Michael yeah but ok ok so Yanni is this going to change things oh no because it 's coming back tomorrow morning but um can I just be clear we had some pretty strong words in and the deputation today about prices good legal advice over the process in response to those concerns that were raised because i don 't want to do anything like the pressure sewer system that puts us at risk of having further challenges so i just think we do need to have some formal response to what was said and be able to explain really clearly you 're comfortable with that be okay right Dave in the back seat criteria analysis we 're out rings second option and quite a number of those things particularly time cost operational costs microwave the residual peasant whiskers greater the Mexican option than what we have in first grade options to print it wasn 't purely on the five hundred dollars so a mine actually table wet little table okay okay okay so tomorrow you 're going to Smith this but also give us so that if people want to vote against this they can see that there are advantages in the end the option in terms of perhaps resilience and timing yeah Ellie I just wanted to say that it 's really interesting I highly respect and understand what these value do you put on turnham for your trees and also this as you see this community has been slammed through the already some of them are still dealing with insurance so well is the default value how do you do that how do you 're quite that rationalize that and by how you vote and he right yeah so i think i think that tomorrow when we 're less tired too besides us it 's all been more of the takers report the detective staff perhaps were able to and i 'm sure you will answer any questions relation to the step will help resolve especially the science part and in how long will this is going to take as well all those questions okay so i 'm assuming that tomorrow we make the decision whether we go with option B if it 's possible or option a but in any case we make the decision on a first stage of the solution at least four locked up right okay now can I suggest oh is this pulling that if we alter the wording of 9.5 that commenced liaison is viable proceed to undertake consultation and report back to council by March so council can make a decision between option a and option B but really yeah I think people are at Lima morally I know how sometimes those too much water I think that 's kind of we are mostly but then but that 's still yeah no covers it but I think people actually want to want to think about it overnight and make the decision on eight thirty in the morning if that 's okay but Albany you say you want to make a decision between AMV tomorrow or in March I 'm so I 'm going to take the beautifully crafted words that Dave and his team are going to come up with tomorrow actually Leanne 's going to do it better and then you 'll all make a call on how you want to vote was there by the way of seeking differ counselor coffers motion there is now the least okay so I 'm thinking that you 're probably at the end of your tether that you don 't want to go for 'd like to close the meeting and start again tomorrow yeah what 's it it may well pull in it may well but let 's just leave that determination till tomorrow we can rip through quite a lot of these in the next hour if you want to but I 'm not getting huge body language responsed fits right ok so i will adjourn this meeting till eight PT tomorrow _"

    "text": "we believe so considerably Kristen northern relief voice 100 million flowers or while the whole of the dot that the project for the upgrades about 1314 but they 're still a significant cost we haven 't done this detailed estimates on that as we have on some of the other options but just quite physically length and knowing the lay rates for large diameter store water interceptors it 's why no means any any less expensive so the Randall has got the main northern relief saw running under view you 're so everything repaired no it hasn 't has not having you work yet is it do for ya album also I 'd like to foreshadow an amendment at the appropriate time thank you there are other questions Yanni just I 'm so kind of struggling to understand the modeling in terms of the impact of the sea coming in and the water having nowhere to go it still seems to me that even if we go back to what we had before the earthquake you 're possibly going to steal her visions you just try and help me understand was flooding you could see the water was segment it wasn 't moving so it 's just ponding turning into a big lake which would seem to indicate that some of the concerns we had yesterday quite legitimate so i don 't quite understand how what 's proposed is going to help move the water out well really is getting in the water to to thee to the avon itself this does there 's no increase in flood risk in banks avenue they weren 't flooded during the match event to the same extent as the people up and the flock de miriam so that water level that we saw in march at the high tide and is no worse after this work than it was that will it was beforehand despite the fact that you might head back water you might have a high tide that 's influencing the avon at that point have we done my in your high geological studies to understand oh absolutely yeah that 's been how the water can escape absolutely it 's all been hydraulically modeled as we 've said right through there had worked on and Thomas that well engaged in that process so the simple answer is that if if it meets the sea that 's how I tired it gets stuck anyway there 's just no only for it unless and that was that was why there 's another consideration going on in parallel with that river entitled protection to look at the alternatives such as tidal barrage and that would prevent that title back water coming up the Avon so that 's another piece of work that the team are currently looking at and then the second question for mayors around the francis earth was pretty you know pretty hard to hear from front facade resonance yesterday and I just really wanted to understand why we can 't do anything to mitigate if we 're not are we doing anything just to reduce that risk or is that just we just all so Sam business well there is a recommendation hire the staff recommendation supposed to investigate extending the scheme up to prance ahead and open there for business concepts if we must assume there 's a drainage that frances air on this pipe for the flop and under and that runs through numerous private properties so there would be challenges with extending the schemer but we need to do more investigation to understand it costs are there although our modeling does include all the pipe networks and we believe that the earthquake effect will be mitigated with what we 're posing doesn 't mean budding will go away francis heirthall they 'll still be considerable flooding up the street and properties but we could we do propose to investigate that further and the next day and then um me feel free to roll this out of order but just in terms of the funding my understanding was that we were talking to government about obviously with the epc stuff let 's come out I just not quite clear where we 've got to in terms of the conversation about the flood and damaged infrastructure Corp case only came out yesterday and that does give us the basis for continuing that conversation what they will see as well so that that part of the total package okay it will costs year to access findings from the around around the physical structure I think the staff answered that before that there is a bit of work that 's being done in conjunction with Sarah to get a better understanding of waters in the cost share for horizontal infrastructure what sits outside because it 's part of our ordinary maintenance or renewals contract and and also what could be there was a third one kilometre in sewell it was a climate change sea level rise if there was an issue and that as well because of course that wouldn 't be co-funded yep just just like to point out a bit of the error on the map and some respects Poulton ab finishes right where the orange sorry the purple line intersects will look and in fact if you took that line that goes through the marion college and continued it in a straight line almost you can see woodchester air coming up there all the houses on the right-hand side of woodchester Eva 's red zone you would effectively have a straight line from marion college right out to the be you would not be touching a hardly a single tree it may be a few around marion college but from there on that 's it 's a straight hike to the river yeah and that was a consideration as well so cold and there not a consideration that what if you took the if you took a the blue line I suppose yes you would have trouble coming up Paul tener with trees and things but for my point of view I think that that purple line it 's a it 's a straight hike right across richmond park right across red zone straight through Miriam it was straight line all the way charisma as Richmond what 's the status of Richmond Park has they 're still Rick hey yeah Rick rush i know that but is it actually being used you know yeah they play cricket and rugby their brain you could put an enclosed box channel under it put the dirt back on top of it and you 've still got a plank you write the proponent now i 'm just checking just to about the proposal your access for maintenance I went across the Parker would need to be a pipe yeah well you could detour around Richmond Park a little bit but essentially it 's a straight line either side original back yep know what we understand it yeah foxygen through and that would be something that we could look at because taking a straight line in a pipe through the Cricket Ground potentially avoid some of the trees around the perimeter of the block it 's right it 's a discussion to be hard if we 're to look further at that route but a piped option might be more expensive than well Charlie young with piped option across Richmond Park but it could be open either side of it but it would be good to have you know some dollars and cents and some costings and a proposal around there because so we 've got a foreshadowed resolution are we able to get it typed up for me okay so are there any other questions before we before we get to that because it 'll just give us a couple minutes to yep the options I mean we 've had a lot of feedback through the submission process the last few days and counselors have received a lot of feedback from a whole range of you know amateur engineers all over the city with their views and they may not be obviously have perfect information but oh I do worry we haven 't actually given you know yes is a highly engineered solution which we 've been looking out for some time but as we 've gone through this process more and more people come forward with a wider look including some of the sort of you know downstream catchment areas stormwater management retreat even I think that has really been discussed enough especially when we look at the numbers involved and they 're probably only going to go up and what worries me is that we haven 't quite taken a lot of that stuff into account yeah that they were say the word do a myriad of options considered and some that we have that made that may have been discounted fairly early on at within that within the team or recharge pumping the water simply into the ground but the risks around contaminating drinking water and those sorts of things were eliminated but there 's several submissions from the private sector on the acting for recharge probably several two or three and others from the tanking house raising the the floating foundations any number of things and there 's a limit to really how much if you do a high high level analysis of the costings of practicalities and then through a process of decision making optimized decision-making process in our those down we come with a suite of three or four and we had a few of those worked up and in March of this year when we had the big event on the fourth of March what about any a number of those options but they may work at the Bruce white proposal that 's a cake came late in the peace during the during the march event engaged with the tar force and the heel don 't they look they actually looked at it so it might not have been a thorough piece of work but Jacobs many other consultancies working with us and that in that group and they looked at it from the point of view of that the shape and style what the conflicts with other services prepared a report didn 't analysis says costings that it didn 't stack up with even then they 're optional option B and so that was through the two stage one of the task force when they did that and in terms of retreat any sort of forgotten things about the retreat we wonder we have 160 properties or so hundred fifty-eight the indicative costs there were 99 plus millions and that didn 't address everyone because they 're not on the same location so you have others that are scattered outside that retreat area so how big do you make that retreat area what do you do with that land you 're losing future income from rates where do those people go the loss of community there was a whole lot of things as well as the as the dollar cost we looked at the social environmental and economic aspects of the impact of a retreat that sort of multi criteria analysis so and it wasn 't favored in the surveys and the engagements we had with the people up there there was a handful of said just buy us out just breads owners or blues owners whatever it 's going to be and and just take our property but again who 's got 100 million dollars to do a buyout solution this is going to end up costing us hundred billion dollars by the time we 're through we 're we 're talking in the year there 's always a cost risk but we 're at the upper bound of our are estimating and that estimating will get will improve as we get through the detailed design and I mean what about several submitters have said actually the water just can 't get out so once it gets once it gets down to the bottom it ends up ponding anyway because you 've got tidal flows coming in you yeah and also there 's just not enough there 's not enough gravity pulling that water down yeah as the whole thing tends to pond anyway you 're saying the constraints at the avon river and the water gets down there and it stops moving it means that the fact that the banks Avenue people aren 't flooding there 's testimony of the fact that the levels that are getting away through the Avon to the ocean and are sufficient to deal with that amount of water and the basis of the modeling is that level that water level does not change after the improvement work so it 's still it 's got hydraulic head so that there is the hydraulic grade line is what determines the capacity of a channel and and that was one of the limiting criterias on the modeling analysis and of course the smarter bottlers than I around and who all over that sort of detail tell her I was going to clarify one of the submitters this morning see that in fact council head and engage with him there was mr. my understanding was that being a Sunni some conversations with staff in mr. quiet can you show us yeah oh yes oh absolutely and now he he met with with matt and mike met with mr. white he then won 't have a further conversation and i made an appointment with me so i said look we 're really busy were doing a report to council on an august i said as soon as that reports landed i 'll spend some time with you and I had an air over them talking talking about the possible solution he was talking about the possibility of him coming on to help deliver the solution and and we had a fairly amicable conversation and I said there would be an opportunity to make any submissions to any proposals that might come out yanny um I just really wanted to be clear that the reason there is no flooding and bank save is because people haven 't self-reported it or because we 've observed it and there 's been no flooding because what we had yesterday was that and I guess I kind of know this firsthand from the a van Lew is that there 's some people that just weren 't living there that wouldn 't have rung up or made contact simply because they 're waiting for Ikki see that waiting for insurance companies they 're not only property so how do you know that things have wasn 't flooded is that what 's that based on we have no data on flooded floors and banks Avenue either through our task force either through the information we 've shared with eq c and insurance covers and a lot self-reported not observed but we didn 't actually go out and observe during floods well as most people over bank seven you 're doing survey and pick up some monitoring where of water levels have risen and there would be information in the bank and the bank 70 area for the task force ok but nothing reported but there 's no chance that you know people weren 't at home and didn 't report that look if there was someone flooded and hadn 't reported it to us we would never know but you have actually exchange data with insurance companies now although we don 't have at least if they were if they 're waiting for a rebuild then they 're not the place is flooded okay I mean either worry the people have actually literally moved out of those houses that will some houses and I don 't know how many are unbanked save that because I thought they did say yesterday that there were two floor levels that were breached but they said that both the houses were empty because people had moved out because of the earthquake damage yeah i mean that 's that 's why I was raising it and then in the second question as it 's kind of a big high level question but it seems to me when you look at the mayor but all the development that 's going on are we simply over developing in in that northern eastern area and there 's actually the catchment that we 're trying to design for just too big that we just end up with this kind of massive project where we should be looking at maybe other more local source sort of solutions I mean that 's yeah but you know yeah it 's something else that 's that that 's a really a planning growth you know praying for patient that 's a that 's recommendations on a previous report was a food we 've developed that through a more accelerated style what are the other alternatives we we are short on stormwater outfalls in that particular area a very limited space for detention storage the ear is to the northeast and you 're referring to Christian saying I feel Preston 's but also all that all the NFL that 's happened and pepper no II you know most of their water drank to the north onto the stick river catchment summer comes Seth and the Preston 's for example comes into number to drown number one drain it goes straight to water like so that has actually come into the Dudley catchment there is some very complex stormwater arrangement around preemptive basin and water can and a change between the sticks and the avin but again that goes into the Dudley diversion downstream you 've done decree so my understanding of the catchment that particular catchment that drains to what ministry area is there that 's pretty highly developed now there will be consideration moving forward but that 's getting addressed through stubble measurement planning processes hailey thank you i 'm just looking at the jobs report and there 's a mention on page 29 tense about in conjunction with a widely live w most private access bridges would need to be replaced with longer spans and typically a high level now there are a number of people in bank sending you who are in the ready I 'm the new job getting with quite work hazel rebuilds underway and the insurance companies or who Envy dealing with are actually looking at replacing the bridges with Bridget 's that are of the same width is the one that 's already here have you had any who would end up paying for those shouldn 't you bridge ously needed after you know the if that 's what we do that channel is violent and had he had have you considered that and costs and each other yeah three chip we 've had a number of discussions with private bridges that need to be removed altered and and been discussing it with both the owners there are a number and where there is where we require a wider bridge that then was there previously we would pay the difference in cost between the rebuild and the wider bridge so does it pretty being a place John so there was a woman i spoke to spoke to last week and rebuild is going to happen before any work has done if in fact that 's the option we go with so there 'll be a brand new bridge foot there for the current current width will the council then be up for the entire cost of a new bridge for the new spans some of the new consents have a new flood level to come back to so to get a building consent they have to come back to the the new flood level so there 's a difference before we want to go beyond that again then the would-be level so that would be an incremental cost and I 'd be interested to know who you might be if someone hasn 't had that conversation I know we 're having a conversation with a number their bridges replaced or in unit very clear let me rephrase it there are people who are rebuilding their houses currently the river is so wide we may have their rebuild done the insurance company or whoever it is will rebuild a new bridge to put that with we meant if we decide to go down the track of why doing along bad seven you and there 's another whatever it is that makes the river wider and you have a brand new bridge that 's being put then who is responsible for picking up the tab for putting a brand new bridge there to replace the brand-new break if we missed that boat then it 'll be a council cost because we will have to bear that cost but we have we having the conversation with with the insurance company some response and there an arrow their project managers to try and capture as many as we can before they go to construction so that 's a work in progress we 've been having several for several months that that conversation has been going on now we 've got and the question is do we want to move it as an amendment to the to the to the main motion or whether we accept that this is what we 're going to be debating and I guess that I wouldn 't mind some advice on that before i get a seconder did you David want to _"

    "text": "um I guess has come clear because we 've had a number of deputations to the council and it certainly it felt to me as if a number of people felt that the deputation process was not a part of the submission process and I think that 's partly at borders it is an issue with our processors as a council and that 's something that we need to address but it also has hammered home to me the risks that we face as a council when we are staff to do things in a very truncated time frame that I think exposes us to a significant amount of well and some respects unnecessary conflict within the community because there will be those who feel that they haven 't had time to contribute to a consultation for example as we heard yesterday and so I kind of want to bearing in mind you know some of the comments that were made as to kind of say look almost almost like we 're sorry we put so much pressure on you in terms of time and I know that in a want to respond with a sense of urgency and to build a sense of momentum around getting things fixed when things are broken and I guess that what we what we came into when we were elected as a council we hadn 't experienced the flooding in the Dudley Creek area or the end and the surrounding areas and flockton we hadn 't experienced there as a council because the previous flood hadn 't_''_129.539 since the previous June and the one before that was the previous August so there had been quite considerable amount of time and what we were confronted with was a one more than 150 year event an April this year and as a result we pulled out all the stops we set up a task force we asked the staff to work up options that they 'd already been working on we went with the two of them we then went beyond that and said no we want to go faster than that we authorize the pastry pump we enabled a whole lot of other things to happen in order to start our waterways flowing as no one round the stable and I knows that people at the end of the table don 't sleep when there 's rain because we know what happens when there are significant rain so in a way I think we 've forgotten the lesson that has been learned out of so many disasters is that you have to balance speed with deliberation and deliberation means sometimes taking a little bit more time to make sure that you give the right answer because if the quick answer isn 't the right answer you can 't_''_216.51 undo it so I certainly felt after listening to the presentations yesterday that there were options that came up during the course of the consultation that we haven 't explored enough particularly with the use of the residential redzone land which we have an opportunity to utilize with the agreement of central government before there 's a consultation on its future use in terms of pathways to to to the river and and of course the significance of the pathway to the river as the impact that that would then have on bank says so I that the other thing that came up for me yesterday and it 's a i wrote the quote down because i quite liked it it spoke to me in layman 's terms something that 's really useful for somebody is not an engineer he talked about the constraint on the plughole and he talked about a constraint on the plughole he talked about Stapleton 's roads later street it 's an Auburn stream and champion Street Kolbert and the impacts of the constraints that he could see and those areas and I wondered whether there was work that still needed to be done in terms of some of the constraints within our system at the moment that we shouldn 't ask you to get on with at the same time as to work up more information that certainly on the alternative option that takes a bypass across red zone land so that 's a terrible way for me to introduce the debate but I kind of almost wanted to say I feel in retrospect that because of the urgency of the situation that we may have put too much pressure perfect solution I don 't know that there is a perfect solution and I 'm just wondering if we just take a little more time not wanting to take the foot off the pedal but to maybe redirect the the path of where we go now in order to have better information to make a final determination early in the new year so I 'm not talking about a delay of months and months and months I 'm actually asking for whether it would be possible to do some more work on one of the options but in the meantime continue doing some work and maybe authorize some work to be completed on what was described yesterday as the constraint on the plughole if the staff agree that that is something that would actually contribute to good results in the area so would you like to start with your presentation okay thank you issue the year the constraint on the plug holes we 've been dealing with a lot of those already through the operations work that we 've done with the task force we 've know about the tons works that have been done there are calibrate removals that bridge removals all that is removing constraints and there is more of that we can do we will continue to do that as they as they arise but there 's a larger problem here and even by March of this year that the the land drainage recovery program had already looked at more than 14 different alternative options any one of which would have worked but they need to go through a process of of ranking those in order of effectiveness timeliness and cost so there was quite a thorough analysis even the option through the intermediate school and and park and Marion college I think oh and had our own southern had a view of that some months ago but again there was there was issues constraints around use of red zone land at the time that was originally considered it 's now back on the table and we can walk you through where we 've got to with that but I think we can 't overlook the primary purpose of setting up the the task force the primary of the people in flockton and Dudley catchment and they are relying on us to come up with a decision they are hoping for a decision today and I 'd like to think that we could give them something positive they can actually have hold on to a bit of hope that we are moving forward with the further investigations and taking a project through to completion if I want to talk just about where we got to with them we know that the consultation that trade-off that we make between getting that the solution that will work being being expedient but also having time for good debate and engagement with the community and we are pushing it to the wire because it was a very short consultation period between the tenth of member in the 26 although we did get out to the banks Avenue people on the twenty-third of October after the last report so we gave them as much early warning as we possibly could so they 've had over seven with nearly seven weeks to engage with us and they have taken that opportunity we 've have come to the Saturday meetings and we 've given them as much information as we can so that 's been very useful they have been actively engaged although short they have been actively engaged all the way through seven thousand plus flyers and 718 booklets delivered throughout the area even in the sum of the areas of the alternative solutions that we 've been proposing have been involved in this the for drop-in sessions that I mentioned plus the interviews face-to-face and telephone and through that process we received 125 submissions and we heard some of those today and yet and yesterday so the connects just that that map that 's up the entire just shows you the distribution of of where whether the summary that whether consultation and the submissions came from a big cluster obviously in banks avenue that big cluster obviously in the flocked and flocked an area and i 've just have to add of the submissions that came from the banks Avenue while there were some people very very passionate about the the the environment the landscape ecological values of the river and the can see it just by walking and driving through there but when I look at the numbers there was some twenty five percent of the submissions from banks Avenue disagree or strongly disagree with the proposal which means that seventy five percent of those people are either neutral or agree so there 's a silent majority who engage with us who says yeah we understand we don 't like it happening in our neighborhood but we understand the peril that the people and flopped and are facing so I take that on board as being a broader message from all the people who engage with us so what were the issues from banks Avenue again we 're in a concept design level of detail we can 't tell them every detail of where things going to go what we 're the walls and where the trees will will end up and what the environmental impact certainly the trees is a major issue and I was surprised to see the report from the arborist saying over 200 trees might be impacted had we given enough thought to the alternative bypasses so there just to pay lip service to our preferred option that wasn 't why we went out there we went out there with genuine concern that and genuinely listening to these people to say what is the most of the most valid or the the most optimal solution to solve these problems so obviously and they were concerned about if you put if you 're charged more water Darren banks am you will that create more flooding for us and of course the hydraulic modeling we do which is the computerized modeling that we do across the entire catchment using very sophisticated software tools and real-world data the flood levels do not change pre and post the work so that there 's no increased risk to people in banks Avenue for the flooding the flockton people obviously they 're they 're concerned about the perils they continue to face and of course the residual flood risk after the works are completed there are a number that aren 't protected during the construction phase will post a street and there is a smaller number that aren 't protected after the the owners Edgware Road Francis Avenue Edward ad Tim street extensions to the scheme looking at those other bottlenecks and plug holes yep and we 've looked at those seriously and bringing them into the equation and of course there are general comments from people outside the affected areas about what that might mean for targeted rates property impacts property values and what it means for ongoing maintenance so the the one that we 're talking about these the sort of option to that we went out there is preferred option during the consultation process we were getting more and more pork for that detour through the Marion college richmond park and a bit of the red zone land and that seemed to engage quite a lot of favor within the community and it did sort of address the issue of the number of trees impacted they 're still we still will be you know environmental impacts from that alignment and there 's certainly a little more costs about five million dollars more cost to do that component as opposed to going down the banks and you 've got the numbers for the bank 's avenue 34 for marion college although we haven 't got clearance from landowners on that route and if that was to be a preferred become a preferred option that would add about three months to the delivery process so there is time risk around that alberta cost risk however all poulton have was the other bypass option that was considered as well as the randall Midway street and we put those in and again increasing costs as we look at those other alternatives now the tree impact on we so walk down here the green shaded areas show the impact of the trees just humanely treated heavily treed areas yeah okay so the bank 's Avenue the avarice report and I think we 'll just circulate that 's brand new hot off the press and we 'll just circulated a copy of that so these numbers came as a bit of surprise to us this we 've got the adverse out there to do a detailed inventory of tree stock and there 's 428 trees about half and half on public land private land of those 're still until we get the detailed design that 's hard to be completely precise but about half 213 would need to be removed and they of course would be replaced or replanted very hard to shift mature trees but we would be looking to re-establish that type of environment in the longer term but you know even with the the Marion college options are still tree impacts their poulton Avenue with the avaril street diversion there is a tree impacts there and even with the Randall Midway street nearly every tree in the Stapleton 's Road corridor would have to be removed as well so everybody every one of these has a has a certain degree of tree impacts so it 's common to all of the all of the solutions so the recommended next steps is to carry on with the property and access negotiations over a preferred route ongoing communications and engagement of the community that will not stop that 'll just be business as usual for us we want to take these people with us at the design of the consent applications because there is time that 's an ongoing discussion and then getting the detailed design and physical works into a procurement process whether that 's tendering whether we look to our alliance to try and cut some time out of that procurement process so we really do want to keep the pedal down we want to bring the community with us and we 're hoping that we can get a decision today that would give the community confidence that we 're keen to move ahead and I 'm I take it to the ports been pretty well read so I 'm happy to take any questions or anything further the team might want to contribute and I 'd like to thank the rods team for the for the community communication and engaged with the community it 's been it 's been for this class yep ok questions I 'll start with a leaving day thank you just a couple of quick ones page 199 point to point 1 mrs. will says obtaining approval for Sarah to proceed on the cost components at citrix it could you explain me John a bit more plea from agreement we 've got two numbers 1.8 billion from the crown 1.1 or understand from the city a lot of the land drainage recovery program work not being broken pipes and a lot of the pillow variables is considered to be a hundred percent funded by the city so we are we don 't necessarily agree with that with that approach so there is ongoing discussions about what qualifies as earthquake damage what was just pure maintenance and how much of this work is addressing the issue of climate change in sea level rise so there 's a piece of work that Keith is involved with the look at the land drainage recovery program and total and then identify clearly in that package how much is that that business as usual work that we should normally be doing anyway how much is attributable purely to the earthquake effects because that 's all the government 's interest needs right and then the bit that addresses the future and I will have that hopefully early new year not much you mentioned them option B would if I 'm correct have an additional compared to option a correct so we 're saying we haven 't had that detailed engagement with the landowners so that would not assume me if that 's the one on we took a Marion college we got in because then the Jacobs report we 've got up options ABCD and in the other report we 've got the food options option b which is the banks in myself in you option two yes so we need to have some sort of uniform language that we 're cool things can we talk ABC TV room if we bring the slide we can just talk about the colors on that slide I 'm talking about the purple one okay so that 's that 's an amended option to actually everyone you were appear to have a routine except remark yeah so the purple piece we need to we need to have direct engagement with the landowners affected by that route there are far fewer languages of right to why would be a longer period of time with his leaf private land ownership negotiation required compared to the others yeah they 're period and with working with syrup there is another process we need to follow through there because it 's in Reed 's ol and not on a road reserve so we haven 't got right of access so we need to negotiate that with God are likely died I don 't mean to sound of juice but I would have thought that dealing with an organization one organization whoever it is would take less time and I 'm not making some assumptions there been dealing with 30 40 50 whatever it is private landowners so where you 've got the purple option which removes a large number of private landowners and it 's primarily non-residential and I still don 't completely understand what you 've just said to me means without because we haven 't done any consultation well that group no we 've got ministry of education as well as private owners and I don 't want to be too optimistic about how long that process might take through syrup so the will be time will add time to the process so how many landowners are affected by that the mystery of Education Marian college through richmond park and but often to the red zone beyond that there 's no residential no residential and there at all so you 're not dealing with private landowners you 're dealing with public land owners yeah from the split from beau collapse yetis okay save at you and eggs thank you look I want to concentrate more just on the banks banks have firm issue one of the submitters yesterday suggested that the a Rovers dropped with buttstock banks up and in fact one of the problems with the lower reaches of banks air is actually the backflow back up the creek itself and and there was a question over the capacity if you won the channel to actually achieve any more flow in a high tide Alvin to the Ruhr and my question really is have we done a thorough assessment of the capacity of the existing channel even taking out some of the love education the field was wandered around there a few that last week and appears to me that there 's actually quite a natural challenge annal through would come out but effectively a high volume of water could flow down that channel around most of the trees that are there already so my question really has have we done that work and what 's what is the impact of the Avon at that stage with with increased levels there and back flow up up the channel are we trying to achieve something that 's not achievable effectively yeah to check that that has been included in the modeling exercise so there 's a in the in the new regime there 'd be no difference in level so any any back water from the Avon would be no worse after the after the works than previously and the capacity is doing men so maybe Tom could talk more about the modeling but that was one of the conditions of the modeling exercise I probably need to look at that I 've heard a couple of further questions you mentioned in your statistics 25 people twenty-five percent how many how many of those were actually on banks a of itself and that are directly affected residents I mean I you know those lies damn lies yeah and the statistics you can yeah well tell top taking that descended cheer through the page 179 on the table area one bank 722 submissions so we don 't actually know that we 're actually talking about affected residents it may be just people in that particular area itself one of those submissions is from the back co-president group which was signed by multiple parties which could mean that there are more strongly disagreeing with the proposal and there are shown here there as my consultation colleague will respond it 's about the quality of the feedback i think is it right Rob yeah I think in terms of unjust Ron interpret the numbers here but it would be fair to say that the engagement that we 've had particular with the banks have residents they there is a very United group there and they I think you would have sent in the submission yesterday that they are very concerned about the area they it is highly prized and there are you know we have been told through the feedback in the consultation of decades and Equifax so and yeah the invader that doesn 't about numbers but I think that I think the council also got the messages day that is a very highly prized area for a residence hmm and my last question or statement but about within the next year or two maybe surely boys high is vacating their site has there been any consideration for a retention a retention basin in that land there it is very low-lying as the next people of that school I can remember vividly on many of winter those outlying grounds being quite waterlogged it would seem to me that long to him there 's not a lot of future for development and terms of housing or whatever for that land and I wonder really whether we should all have considered creating a substantial retention basin in there to assist with the release release of water out of flopped and basin yes that my understanding that there has been an engagement with the Shirley boys in the minister of education but this that 's probably seven years out before they plan to 4427 a storages better above the catchment would help slow the release through banks fat won 't gain the benefit from that for at least four years for 27 years is there a place is there a catchment you know an area where you could have ponding that 's you know further up I mean somebody recommended that I even looked the other day which seemed to be above that the normal area that we 've had recommended would that have any would that have any benefits the ovum you have to go through this in Albans Creek catchment would be very long way to go even in the we did talk about within the team when we were developing those fourteen options considering whether or not we could divert San ovens Creek down to the Aven and then release the pressure through the downstream on the Dudley but there 's certainly a lot of complexities in a lot of engineering what to do then not to say that other the taste Rick drain essentially pump station essentially provides that or does it function yeah it sends water under the double egg elsewhere in the catchment that essentially through ongoing and different times during the process but we should sort of come back to conveyance solutions being the optimum who 's next clean thank you Mike I a question in relation to the arborists report on page 2 the second paragraph under the table here and I 'd like to ask this question against the backdrop of a community that 's very organized and notice their own mind is as you know the purple option as you 've said could potentially take three months longer could I have a couple of timeline scenarios over the purple option could take three months longer but then if we go with the other as the arborist report indicates they 're at in trees on private land which are in a condition such as you wouldn 't need resource consent for their removal 10 on public being the risk you would so in terms of a time and cost scenario which resource consent required you know one option the pit one maybe three months longer but you know if you go with what 's been recommended 's always the time frame for resource consenting is always a risk one of the other things that contributing to that extra time for the purple root is that from the 23rd of October meeting we actually had the cleaners to go ahead preparing the rhd for the for the option option b which is the original on the green room so that means you 'd have to stop that era più recraft that for this alternative so there 's there 's another element that adds to that time the labor year you 're right the the consenting could add more particular with protective trees it could complicate things somehow I just want to acknowledge Sean 's week to your whole team Jonathan it and there 's being quite human thank you I 'm pulling what 's got a couple of questions if I may one of them was from the deputation yesterday about the taste Street pump and just a clarification that I can 't read lips submitter it was but I 'm saying that there was supposed to accommodate two uniques and now it 's gone down to the design for the detai Street pump station is to cue minx okay that 's 2,000 liters per second okay so that person had that information and career watch your back from thank you and secondly the the blue in the read the April in the Randall which is Cindy can you please give us an outline of the costs of those an obviously to be a rough cost because you haven 't done detailed but compared to the other two that possible more end or the disadvantages of those that you see yeah well the the costs are much so when you look at the length of the bypass the pipe bypass exactly greater than the banks Avenue the in channel workers about the same we 're still going through very constrained channels access is more difficult we still have conflicts with other services the change in the profile the road would met that all utility services would needed relocating if you 've taken that option as it was presented yeah the Randall Midway well this morning the deputation see there wouldn 't be a change in the profile you still have conflict with other utilities and major source which means what you 'd have to relocate other major infrastructure and it 's longer so you 're saying that the cost of the render were midway option would be greater than the banks even greater that 's our estimate you _"

mention the locations in frontage of the wispy more under these time locations in 100 125 a victim go last time we can see only Palomino will be few of them against against a majority especially all those affected the community business of the owner even individual breast and all support a location-based locations in fantage of westfield mall but this standard because my vehicle still slightly different from the staff even a counselor figure still opposed the 73 29 percentage is kinda figured that month it means a motor people still prefer the best location in vantage of a spear more and also you will report yesterday for our five people for organization on behalf of wider community the one is achieved free mr. hero he is the chairperson of the victim push kill Monica resident Association Asia dis on behalf of northern part of the central region probably I assume double act a series of 500 the property mode she on behalf of Middleton medical resident Association in central victim area popular another 500 or 600 property in surrounding area and third one sir Dave curry is currently the committee member of central weeks and resident Association Jason southern pattern probably another a hungry tonight hungry because the area is high density population the area so we can see it 's not a few individual Preston 's against mr. location age a wide range of you know the the community against this kind of location means that is the signal noticed another the cooler you know the location another one is the we might consider you know the because the I still like a taste if the committee member of central region Western Association yesterday he emphasized that 's very cool you know he emphasized if we reviewed a local commentator section 78 almost before making a decision need to have proper consultation whether complying with the community preferences for it with reviewed early speaker hods neither complying with the community preferences and also regarding to the section 77 whether consider the social community will be this also so I don 't think so let 's a popular decision so this why either member and also if you review the content of the victim at the week when a cameo the recommendation actually is combined all those the council staff recommendation but just give the one more time opportunity try to recommence to renegotiate with the kind of whisper mode but the pace on the staff answer they already have written the document but why not can why not at all with the submitted for the recommendation because you already done this one so you you can you know displayed to the communal to the community we are Wiggly tongue but is twice to your fail so now we go to the least original then there 's the start recommendation so that 's why I would like to note to amendment to posted a little ribbon education thank you thank you cancel alums down personally I believe the Westfield location has the better location and personally I actually believe that this may be better handled through the district plan review where a key activity center once it reaches some of their land for community and community infrastructure which would encompass that the exchange I was part of some other negotiation with we filled out I 'm very disappointed they are trying to hook us into something that we cannot actually do something that actually goes against our you know the regulations that we 're bound by under the local government act and so the only other option we have is this option it 's the only one we have in front of us and I 'm disappointed it 's the only option but it is the best of our options that we have so I will be supporting this today but it is with disappoint I do is I do support it but as I say we 've been put in a difficult position we could look at other ways ahead Leslie through the disrepair review but maybe for another conversation clean thank you I just gives one perspective from not being a member of the Eni committee is that for me this clearly is captured by the report that came to us on the 13th of november metropolitan significance so I know I recognize potentially Jimmy 's in a difficult place but actually this is about being a city council we have to think for the city so I encourage us all today to reach beyond the parochialism there it 's the second biggest usage we know for bus hinges in the in the city riccarton with over 3000 to up to three cows in a day I think let 's just make this cool wit with the again and get on with it David East I think you look I 've supported jimmy and his amendment today and i believe really that we have seen a situation where the residents associations the business people the community board have all signaled a preference for west field like like Paul I think ultimately we may end up what we probably will end up going for the solution before us today but here I really want a signal that we 've had a massive earthquake in this city and the opportunities that avail ourselves to make advancements for the future are endless I don 't actually believe that we and we really needed to be thinking 30 years or more out I would be happy to look at what we 're doing ultimately at 1 2 3 1 2 5 as being a short to medium term solution I don 't think it 's it 's in an area of briquette and road that is already congested we 're not getting the buses off the side of the road we 're using the existing Road footprint at the moment and things will only get worse long-term we 've got to be thinking about getting our buses off the road and record and an exchange where inwards buses can outwit buses go either side of a of a waiting lounge and just where we ultimately fit that I I can 't offer a solution at the moment but I honestly believe that if we pass the resolution as I think it will go ultimately we need to be signaling to counsel that we need a longer term solution for this problem what we are proposing here is short term and I don 't think it 's going to meet the about 15 years maximum Paul 's raised a very good point where we should be addressing this issue perhaps through the district plan and I think we actually need to be sending a signal to start that this is ultimately possibly going to be the best of a bad bunch of options and but we need to be looking out further for a 30 year plus solution to this this problem what we are ultimately will approve today I think is only going to be a short-term thing it 's not ideal and let 's get their thinking caps on and look at something further down the track which is going to be something unique for this area that is the major corridor of public transport into our city and it 's only going to grow bigger and what we propose here as I 've said I 'll probably repeating myself here but it 's only short-term I felt the order thank you I know this isn 't easy we 're basically trying to fit a modern bus transfer station and to you know a very busy very busy infrastructure and in terms of getting the best option look this isn 't a perfect world in terms of what we 're going to to obtain but it 's clear to me that this is by far the best interim option that we 've ever had and it won 't be long long term but it needs to serve the bus uses right now we can 't afford to wait to have our bus users waiting in the rain another winter that just isn 't on there 's no question that the whole purpose of the bus lounges to get people on buses to attract them to to it and cut in a comfortable surroundings but also so that in fact buses will be able to relieve the congestion which nobody wants and generation zero made that really clear to us when they made their deputation where they told us that in fact the way for young people now is to use buses don 't want to don 't want to or can 't afford to run cars there 's there 's no doubt in my mind that in fact westville of safety and in fact this council have known that for a long time it 's a bit of an iron in a way that that the owners and operators of westfield in terms of the submission they submitted the bus stop be at one two three two one to five regular road what is it about that that some people don 't understand there 's no no question at all that tomb in my mind that this field don 't really want to have a bus stop at westfield and that 's just how it is we 've it we 've explored as a council many options since the beginning of time when i was elected now is the time we cannot afford to wait any longer okay jaani thanks yeah i think this is becoming a really difficult issue and essentially we should have let the crown get on and do this right after the earthquake they agreed that they would do it we agreed that they would do it and we 're the ones that soon a year trying to grapple with it and you know it park and probably a quicker and easier prices than we can putting a civilian bus interchange on which should be a pretty straightforward simple thing to do i 'm really concerned that this is based on a model of public transport that doesn 't in my view seem to make a lot of scent which encourages people to take more buses in less frequent on some suburbs and then more frequent along main corridors in fact the irony is the thing that we 're doing in the central city is trying to stop the amount of buses going into the central study because of the old colombo straight all the buses lined up and it actually created a pretty unpleasant atmosphere and all we 're doing is just putting the same problems we had in colombo street upper and right so it doesn 't seem to make much sense to me so i think we do need to start thinking about how we get the long-term solution and i have to say it is through our district plan is through the RMA it is through the powers that we have the right places and for far too long I believe we 've been two hands off as a city and allowing huge developments to take over our suburbs take over residential areas take over local roads and develop and you get these huge places that get built that don 't actually contribute to the community well-being because there 's no public amenity or infrastructure that 's needed so going forward I just really urge you to consider using the district plan like the government have done with the recovery strategy using designations using ways in which we have as a council the ability to provide for well needed infrastructure to support the things that we need to do ending up on a year-long negotiation is without any leverage is never going to work for us we have to be a lot more hands-on so removing rules in our district plan is not the way to go removing the need for integrative assessment is not the way to go putting in firm requirements where we 've got big buildings or developments happening that these have to be integrated is definitely the today I do think we need to take a much more strategic approach I appreciate you there 's a short term solution that you 're trying to find and it 's all based around changes to the bus network that someone else has made which doesn 't make it any easier but fundamentally what we heard was that it 's only one in five people that are actually waiting for a bus twenty percent and when you look at places like West field or ritalin road there 's plenty of places where people can wait they have a pretty good level of amenity people have got a good liberal immunity will have in the central city they 'll have a super stop at the hospital and another one in town and then there 's other areas of the city like New Brighton what amenities do they have a new brighton for public transport that 's what I 'd rather be putting this capital investment into those areas that actually have very poor amenity for public transport so I don 't believe that this is a prudent use of our money strategic solution rather than just keep spending money on temporary short-term so that don 't make strategic seems thank you I 'd like to say a couple of words on this as well and to start by agreeing with the view that that this is not an ideal solution in the sense that the position that we find ourselves and is not an ideal environment for decision making and there in my view has a lot to do with the split between the different decision makers that we have in our public transport system the Christchurch City Council does not determine the roots it does not determine the particular approach that 's been adopted the Environment Canterbury adopted the hub and spokes model I think back in 2012 after considerable period of consultation but a consultation that I as a local Member of Parliament did not have any line of sight on and did not involve my cell phone so and as a bus user I don 't use the the model of changing buses I 'd rather stay on a bus longer then get off a bus cross the personal point of view and I know that there are a lot of bus users who feel exactly the same way but we have what we have what I like about this proposal unlike the previous record on road proposal was that this has the potential to join up with the mall and it makes absolute sense to me that we get direct entry into a bus interchange and a hub in on riccarton road that actually people can walk into from them all that to me would be the best of all worlds and actually as a preferred option to having it separate and the car park so and the thing that 's really sold me on this site as the as the traffic lights for crossing the road because you can talk about the traffic lights being just a few metres down the road but I know people will rather take their chances across the road then to walk a few meters down the road cross the road and walk back to where they want to go so I 'm I 'm sold on the idea that this 're making today and and I think that we 're is a lot of work to be done in terms of getting a very streamlined well understood public transport system that works for Christchurch and I certainly want to be playing an important role and ensuring that that does does happen I don 't know that the model that we 've had has actually enabled that to happen in the best possible way so under the circumstances I 'm going to not support the amendment and I 'm going to support the original motion so on that basis i 'm going to now put the amendment so those in favor of the amendment please say aye those opposed say no that is lost would you like to record your opposition and so that is Jimmy chin Yanni johansson and David East thank you and now I moved to the motion and the motion as as as its shown on the screen move council to Clearwater second to cancel the scandrett i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no just councillor Jimmy chin opposed you very much now we will adjourn for afternoon tea if we could be back here at say ten to four is that enough time nine minutes 10 to 4 thank you you _"

    "text": "public transport item which is back on the infrastructure transport and environment committee agenda and that is on page four five six as that as the report beginning and the recommendations on 468 just to clarify the recommendation when it refused to the above recommendations that 's referring to the recommendations made by the staff not the recommendation coming from the rectum Wigram community board so it is a reference back to Clause 6 paragraph 6 the staff recommendation so it 's the series of recommendations around the new intersection approvals the proposals around record and Road both sides and then on top of that subject to the signing of a lease with the owners of 1 2 3 2 1 25 record and road so that is the recommendation that 's in front of the the council and that 's moved by mover by Phil Clearwater and seconded by Tim scandrett I 'd also like referral petition remind council officially I just went from from generation 0 that we had the Prairie to us so could we could we note it so it is recommended that the staff frequent be received and you can come up with the right wording to put on there and and that yeah the rest yeah okay and I think counselor Jimmy chin has an amendment that a lot of amendment yes so if we could have your amendment okay thank you how do you get up great yes is there an amendment therefore Jimmy chin right so that 's the that 's the tentative motion which is that the community I think that should be changed to the record and web grum community board recommendations be adopted yes and that 's got a mover and seconder so I think that rather than I think that we should we should deal with all of the questions that people want and I think we can 't reduce both of those both the amendment and the end be substantive motion and we can we can we can perhaps get an update from staff to begin with in terms of where things are up to with the with negotiations as far as the obtaining a lease with the owners of 1 2 3 2 1 25 record to the decision that we will make today so I 'm in regards to lease with 1 2 3 1 through 5 reckon road and CBD limited and we have a agreed and the the lease and principal and so that means we 've we 've agreed all the all the various causes and and both parties are happy with them that leases and the process of being drafted and then it 's just up for review is obviously going to be minor changes just on language from Emily respective and there 's conditional upon what your approval was one of the key components of it and yes that 's it really we 're him and the other thing that I wanted to put right on the table right at the very start is that there 's been a lot of publicity and the news media around the position of record and mall and we skills and how the and obviously it 's relevant because of the and that 's been moved in terms of the written word Graham community board recommendations and perhaps if he could give us a the mall when in the outcome of those certainly so we 've been negotiating words whistled for what since April of this year there 's been what 11 key issue which we are unable to get across switches and it was surmised by we still themselves in the paper last week when it was their view that a commercial solution to the loss of land and amenity on prime record and road frontage as most appropriately resolved with the land swap as part of the compensation package so that was three days ago ever since we started negotiating with them in April of this year that has always been their position our position is that we 're simply not legally able to enter into any agreement relating to the Clarence Street land and we we have a number of legislative requirements that we need to fulfill before we 've been in a position to do that we 've also got our own council policy which we need to comply with before we 're able to do with this list of all the currently as it sets that the Clarence Strickland change which field have been advised of that and they were advised of our timelines all the way through they were unwilling to accept that a number of number we tried a number of things in order to conclude an agreement with Westfield when we did almost concluded room with Westfield there were various aspects came in to any agreement which just nobody could agree to in any type of commercial or public sense at all and as such we continued and sort very hard to reach agreement and we simply were not able to as they were still as evidenced by their their quote in the paper last week determined to secure some form of agreement relating to the Clarence real and and perhaps you need to really explain for us why there it is not possible to do lens well certainly at the moment whilst the community center is certainly damaged it has still been decided what what is actually going to happen with that community center there are three options which are being considered one is to rebuild on the existing site and one is to purchase the third option was to lose at least somewhere else and rekelen until that decision has been made nothing can happen with with that landed still sets with that community center usage on it first or effort is determined that we are going to sell some portion of its not yet determined which portion if any and even even then we 're still we still have to go through our own counsel disposal process which circulates the property around all other council business units and that sees if there 's there 's another council use for it if there isn 't another council use for it we then have to go out and consult with the public pursuant to section 138 of the local government act and that 's relaxed when when we dispose any type of of parkland whilst this may not fit the the meaning of the park which we would commonly refer to it is and the section of the legislation Park means land acquired or use principally for community recreational environmental cultural or spiritual purposes and we need to as I said consult with that once and we cannot predetermine the outcome of that consultation there may be a resounding no do not sell the land from the community if we 're at that stage then we 're in a position to dispose the land we still have to comply with our legal obligations pursuant to section 40 of the Public Works Act 1981 which is where we have to offer land acquired via the Public Works Act back to the owners but the prior owners all their successes and we 've gone through that work and identified that there is one portion of that land that they need to have the chance to take up any offer back that that is in place then once we 've done that we would then need to resolve the council would need to resolve if it is in the best interest of the community to deal unilaterally with Westfield our own council property disposal processes say that you know we should not deal unilateral one party once but there are exceptions to our Egyptian and and obviously you know a land swap would actually be one of those yes that is certainly an option then at that stage then and only then would we be able to enter into an agreement that pertain to relay and clarence street and the bus stop however the the time frame for what I 've just outlined is it 's not quick whisper were advised at this time frames we were tempted to work with them through a memorandum of understanding which meant that we would walk hand and hand through this process without guaranteeing any outcomes because we cannot guarantee it 's not of any up yeah yeah and that there wasn 't acceptable and each time as I said we almost came to an agreement we wouldn 't the negotiations were incredibly serious and we worked all the way through we looked at a number of options in a number of different ways the the basic crux of it is we were just seeking to get a very basic ground lease 10 car packs for 45 years that was and that we couldn 't reach that conclusion due to the fact that there was a desire from Westfield to secure the i mean just because i think the public perception was that the that the the only reason that we couldn 't do the land swap was because it would be just dealing with one party but actually that 's the thing that 's the easiest thing for a count sort of maybe the resolution about its all the other stuff they would have to go through without a doubt a predetermined positions he couldn 't enter into an agreement with westfield and I man just tell me if I 've got this right you couldn 't enter and we couldn 't enter into an agreement with Westfield before we commenced the process of going out to public consultation that 's correct so that the last step is as you point out is the easiest deal yeah and that 's resolving to deal unilaterally the other steps we do we don 't know what the outcomes would be we still have to go through those processes at some stage yeah but we do not know what the ark and we 'll be okay and now tell me an example of the five-year I mean let 's not look at the real intention but let 's look at what were the sort of conditions that they wanted to put on me and in September we would essentially verbally agreed Elise by the time the the lease documentation was presented previously unmentioned Klaus Klaus 30 had been inserted which was a six-month termination clause westfield were counseled to acknowledge that whistle were going to develop the land and that was six months notice they could terminate the lease there was you know if council is going to inject that type of capital expenditure into a project and in essence we had a six month lease that was just a almost a day by day rollover right okay right questions Jimmy chin except that you insert a mere the questions that every time we you have a negotiator is the phase field where the council ever any written document this we have vehicle yet we this numerous written documentation there 's been numerous versions of leases have gone turn through between council 's own legal legal side as well as Westfield 's legal Zealand director we 've been involved with the development executive we 're from from our side we 've involved councillors to see if we can get this across the line councillor Clearwater and council lonsdale that wasn 't successful we involved the the chief executive we wrote them a letter outlining why we were unable to enter into this agreement but still saying that you know there is a desire for that council continues to be interested in concluding the negotiations unfortunately because of the fact that we are unable to enter into the type of binding agreement that we still wanted with Clarence Street these discussions were not successful second questions that are because based on your information only considers three work but I just want to know whether you also consider structure upgrade and also consider the kind of the detailed cost effective in analysis regarding to this kind of agreement yeah the need to be keep away because these these negotiations are certainly commercially sensitive however the the terms that that we have agreed in principle certainly I do not believe what counsel in a an onerous would she on behalf of Middleton multiple resident Association have a recommendation regarding to the kind of no frontage of the West View mode the currently they have the planter box outside of the very few more actually if we consider remove those the planter box here for one more the pasta no can stop in there one more space so whether these the recommendation will be considered by the stop as part of the stream work I think one is worthwhile with all-knowing Council team is that the existing bus shelters are currently on Wisteria Lane so the land that they sit on our Wis field and they are there at Westfield 's pleasure there there is no legal agreement there is no agreement full stop for those Sheldon 's to be on that land so we are simply there at whiskers pleasure there is nothing stopping Westfield requesting council remove those from the land at any given stage last question last question I really started that consultation of figure 1 is overall vegan here also I I detailed check the attachment in spatial leader in info tachi Environment the difference over order in here consultation stop the particular mention general over for sepoys 172 opposed 73 comments only nine total 253 but I calculate each one of them the general supporter is a 112 but opposed the 114 come is only what what 12 so looks like a more against the current you know stuff aside I 'm wondering why the figure is the difference what we can do is ask consultation leader full of rotten speak consulate United I 'd have to look at how you came to that conclusion because my that the conclusions that we came to were based on the submission feedback spreadsheet that clearly stated yes no and did not indicate so I 'm wondering whether comments only with would have been from people who provided comments only if you see what I mean they didn 't actually indicate their preference I 'm not sure yeah I can I can provide you with this information because this actually I this was very carefully cheat and as far as I as I understand that this is clearly stating the the preference of all the we did make it clear in the actual and this summary here that we are a number of individual submissions from generation 0 they make em and they they were in bed also that there were specific comments from some some submitters commented only on division and carry street and that 's why we 've put their here but so I 'm sorry I can 't answer that your question knew except that that is based on very clear data that we have that we 've got here in terms of those who supported and those who did not through these submissions there 's you know rate is you take a tuna yeah they 're like right I can provide that to you if you 'd like to fit there would be great thank you who was next and David you 've indicated that it may take a couple of years to resolve all the issues around Clarence trick can you just outline whether it would be feasible to continue with a an operation that we 've got now Westfield and wait the two years and negotiate with Westfield took yet counselor Esther any-anything regards to that as possible however anything like that carries a certain amount of risk we may get round two years down the track once we 've completed our a due process and it discovers we 're not able to dispose of Clarence Street land and then we 've gone two years down the track there 's also the risk that you know if we care on the status quo we have no formal occupation right to those existing bus shelters the by all means if it was the counselors which we could certainly seek to can you do that however in two years time we may still be no further down the track we may not be able to dispose of clarence street and and the interim we may have been evicted from our current site i think to also from an operational point of view bear in mind the you network starting on the eighth of december it could be said that we are leaking some patron preach furniture already through inadequate facilities on the existing site in safety concerns yeah i was going I 'll save some other comments for the debate yep so winter staff could help iron to us in summary the safety can the safety concerns i guess particular the safety advantages to of the current site because that is quite major flawless of course and well i suppose one of the big benefits of the one two three one two five site is it is adjacent very Jason to existing crossings pedestrian crossings across riccarton Road which you can 't really say the same for the Westfield sides there is no adjacent crossings and going there as a casual observer or not you all see people yep walking between busy lanes of traffic trying to cross the road from one side to the other and I think that probably sums it up with division with the division street intersection with the signals you have a way of trying to maintain a bit safer environment for you to cross the road to catch buses on the other side of the road or to go to the shops on the other side of the road and vice versa yep I 'm but I 'm still trying to get a proper answer under 5 financial implications you say that the capital program cluding funding for this project is appears as part of the cost sharing agreement government and it was agreed that the government through Sarah would be responsible for delivering the central city projects while the council would deliver civilian proposals I can 't see anything where we 've ever agreed that we would we would deliver this in fact the cost she is really clear that the crown would lead the delivery of these and it would pick up the shortfall and funding so I want to understand why the crown isn 't delivering this project we in agreement was made that we would do it and what the financial implications the shortfalls are being met by the crown will be met by us well I 'll speak to that I 'll speak to that first through peddling buying at Council we 've taken advice on the operation of the cost sharing agreement from from the start of the project and that advice has been that this project does in I mean unfortunately if the if the if somebody had thought about this at the time and I wasn 't here at the time it would have been sensible to keep it within the realm of the government central city recovery plan and pepsis is just identifying just one of the that a small problem around having one plan to the CBD and elements that then require a connection with the rest of the city and CBDs tend to need to be connected to the rest of the city the government could have used its powers of compulsory acquisition at the time that they established this network and it would have just solves so many problems that we had but we haven 't_''_1413.7 we haven 't got the capacity to use those provisions and we wear as we 've just heared would have to go down and exhaustive and sounds exhausting process in order to get to a compulsory acquisition on record and road and it may not be ideal now from what I 've heard about the location of the traffic stops so the traffic lights might actually be the things that would be great as if Westfield would open up the wall at the back and then we 'd have everything so I just I 'm still kind of trying to understand from the council going to the cost yet in a report that said the crown would do this project how we 've got to we 're doing it it is mentioned in the accessible transport plan which is a crown plan and it says that the improved facilities in work and air are required to support the central city public transport network so it 's in the recovery plan it 's in the cost share but we are doing it and I can 't find I don 't know why in the report we 've got it 's saying that we 've agreed to do it when I don 't think we have well we have and that 's another capital program I think you 're probably asking a question yeah you know could only be us by people yeah does it solve our little changes no it 's not it 's I mean the thing this consideration okay the fundings relevant so what 's happening is the funding the financial implications are that the funding is that is that the the amount of the proposal is on our budget dividends David issue and our lasers at their governments which is covering the cost share projects outside of the horrible yeah that 'll be great can I just add something else we 've device we got from Peter Lane line was that the council share of the cost sharing agreement amounts to thirty-three percent twenty nine point eight million dollars of the whole project which is just like 19.4 93 million dollars right and the way it 's structured I understand is that for this riccarton project that priority and the loungin this council is responsible for a hundred percent of the costs the budget since I sorry the budget and what amazes somehow over 29 that 's great yes it comes out of the total convenient that we essentially we 're drawing down from our own contribution right so too but there is no way that this is an additional cost to what we agreed thank you very good right so really to put the amendment first and and then the other one but we might as well debate the whole lot as one and then i 'll put the amendment and then i 'll put the emotion so yes so so who would like to contribute to the debate on this counselor chin what _"

relating to tree removal requests contain contain key can you delete the minimum information as follows and just leave the colon and then take out the intro to six point three point to take that out and take out up to date advice on the medical office or health because we 've already given to we 've already said that they have to get independent advice and remove six point three point one and then put a map showing the location of trees of allergy causing species in the vicinity on council then and wherever possible on adjacent private land and a problem dispersal calendar how 's that and any other factual health-related information which may help the board make it sound evidence-based decision yep I don 't think did the mover and seconder mind that going on you 're okay with that yep so so we 'll we 'll just include that and the and the recommendation a sequence of events sorry yes yeah yeah so the first the first amendment I mean we 're going to have the debate and I think we should just have a wide-ranging debate across the issue and the first issue that that we will vote on as whether we change sole cause of the applicants condition to major cause of the applicants condition and the second item that will deal with as the cost sharing one who 's going to be yeah so I wonder if we should if we should no it 's a double negative so well then the amendment as the amendment is to make up the owner the owner 's responsibility so we should deal with that one and the other is that it should be and this was my idea was that it you just vote against that 7.7 if you disagree with the butt but there 's an amendment to it which would take out the cost share arrangements we deal with that next and then the final clause as whether it contains that 7.3 or seven or not yeah 7.7 or not alright now I 'll open it up for debate Pauline yep nation to the definition of major do you know how to interpret a major cause of the health of a person we have absolutely no idea yeah I thought that might be the case thank you right so Pauline well it doesn 't look it oh yeah yeah can we just not have a debate about that we 're not just have a debate about the issues that are before I just wanted to speak to the payment options and what no I 've called Pauline and if you all pay attention you 'll all get your turn Nikki um there 's two reason I actually moves the amendment at the environment committee level because of the amount of the budget increased requests from staff to 130,000 I know it 's an outside amount but it 's still being requested to be put aside secondly because I thought it would be it went into the applications as well because otherwise if there 's no cost at all people of just probably going to run for it so it makes people the other thing too is that around the table here we 've got some people saying the applicant should be the full cost we 've got some people saying that the council shall be the full cost in the applicant none and bearing in mind historically and the Pendleton y mari if had trees removed with the applicant has already bull net for full cost so I thought it would be a little unfair to leap now to the council funding one hundred percent of any removals so I think that 's a fair way to go approach this and then the short tune and let 's see how it pans out so I 'll be supporting the cost share on this okay good Jamie ref can speak to the major this soul what it 's worth I 'm supported major because i think the Psalms a wee bit onerous the reason why I 'm saying that I believe that the applicant should be a one hundred percent of the costs for this so a couple of reasons first thing and I 'm apologize if this is sort of teaching pays we all need to be really really cognizant that means every single resident in Christchurch players council means residents so they pay for it via their rates so we 're proposing that either the reason pays for these removals or the community pays for the removal or the community pays half the removal when we say council so this now that we 've got that sort of the reasons why I think in this period that we should say if it is the major or so cause that the applicant should pay is one following on from what Pauline 's just see which i think is a really fair point we 've got a whole lot of people and this is around precedent that have gone through this process and they have had legitimate medical concerns due to silver birch trees and they have paid for the removal of it I think then all of a sudden it is a dangerous precedent to send within all the sudden encounters then subsidizing this the next thing that I really want to say about this is that if the council is influx of people having it having a gala that 's trying to maximize that because it reduces the price that they have to pay okay and as a result of this I 'm really concerned when I 'm going through this report that the best the way you make a good decision obviously is from the best advice that you 've got and we the best advice that we have around us is up to date advice from the medical officer of health that 's effectively saying that there are many other things out there which cause allergies more so than this particular species of trees you know such as grass and that there are a wide range of issues that actually contribute to people feeling poorly or having allergic reactions as opposed to just simply being a silver birch tree outside there so what I would propose is that I actually believe that there are people like the like the react family that have a real problem due to the silver birch tree medically and that there is something that needs to be done about that but when you a wide range of other issues there we 're effectively going to be reviewing this in 12 months time so I don 't want the council to be going out spending a huge amount of money having a huge financial impact at the time we can least afford it to play a science experiment we 're playing a science at the experiment right now with rate payers money on something that the medical officer of health totally contradicts the medical officer of Health says that they 're armed there are more allergic reactions from grass so we 're not even going down the grass path here we 're going down the silver birch one and we 're going to say that we are going to have a trial for public money into removing these trees when we because we 're not convinced that the scientific advice that we 've been given is actually true so I I have a real issue with that I think that if there is a genuine problem with that silver birch tree let 's let them if they really believe in their heart of hearts through an actually find out we 've heard that the real family haven 't we haven 't even heard what the outcome of there has been we haven 't heard from anyone what 's actually happened since these trees have been removed so on to what basis are we making an assumption that we are going to put hundreds of thousands of rate payer dollars tention into saying that we don 't even know whether or work or not so let 's have 12 months to actually see whether it does if it 's that much of an issue for someone just as they pay a bit more to have their gluten free stuff of exempt much of an issue they can play over this twelve-month period to remove and replace it with a more appropriate species throughout that time have a conversation with them see if it has worked see if it 's alleviated the symptoms and you know what if it has and they say I feel so much better now that has made the world of difference for me when we review that in 12 months time hand on my heart and say that I 've spent residents money wisely I think if you vote for this you put rate payer dollars in something which is a science experiment we don 't win the evidence and this very report contradicts that I think it 's I think it 's a not a prudent decision i think it 's financially irresponsible when we are really limited with funds to put rate payer money as this experiment spin 12 months have a conversation with people that actually have gone through this and in 12 months time we can see whether or not these mirrors and putting rate payer money into this but right now there is no way that we 're we 're you know cutting a christmas party or christmas decorations or anything like this that we 're going to spend goodness knows how much more than that on something which advice goes against happy to if there really is a problem the feedback start backs backs up this but don 't rush into it right now um rev yeah thanks i mean i kind of echo what the work the committee 's done it 's a very very difficult policy to put together and I think in terms of the costs I mean there are other options I 've spoken to the forestry school and the student volunteer army and there is the potential to set up tree chopping days where you actually get a lot of this stuff done for nothing so the forestry school gets to practice chopping trees down the SVA comes and clears all the stuff away it 's actually you can reduce costs quite a lot again a community response to a community problem I think in terms of the the major aspect the reason I put that in there is it 's almost impossible outside a laboratory to say anything is the sole cause of something when it comes to human health is very very difficult but I think with the right medical approvals I think we should be able to deal with that and that 's why i put major in and i think the the 12 months review is really important so we have to be clear we 're 'll review it and we need to get that anecdotal and medical evidence of people we 've had the trees removed what are the outcomes and we need you know this actually is quite a cool research project so maybe we can bring you know some student researchers and for that as well so I think that 's I think to me this makes a lot more sense and then in 12 months hopefully we 'll put together a longer-lasting policy I 'm Andrew I 'm having some real difficulty with this is fair saying and as a person that suffers from siege in that seasonal allergies myself and who a person who has effective treatment for those allergies I know how miserable it can be living with you know running eyes and running nose and sneezing and you know all of those debilitating things that come from there but I look at paragraph 4.15 and I believe what medical officer of Health is telling us and I based my decision on that I mean Jake Jamie talks about the cost of taking the trees out of classic councils expense reports the cost of community boards time the cost of the reporting that 's been done so far the cost of our own time here today and I look at this and I see that based on the medical officer of health center ice there 's likely to be very little effect two invoking this policy so regardless of who pays the bigger question for me is the substantive issuers is this policy actually going to work because if we 've got the medical officer of Health saying more people are allergic to grass pollen and tree pollen and where there are a number of trees in a neighborhood you know the pollen spreads far and wide it 's very difficult to pin this down to one train I certainly won 't be supporting the amendment for the the major cause but then if you go back to the sole cause when you look at the way the resolutions are crafted versus the medical officer of health a lot of time on something that actually doesn 't work because it 's unworkable so for that reason I 'm going to 're doing is is spending a lot of time and energy and money on something that isn 't actually going to have the effect for the people that are affected David thank you I have problems with the word major and and I think that its leaves us I was open to quite some debate as to what is major much mana and what level will actually sit long as being an appropriate action to move this policy forward if anything I 'd probably support something my predominant but I 'm comfortable with the way it is I 'm also sort of conscious that you know in in the city we have a number of what I would call vexatious reasons for removing trees and i think that the policy that we 've got here probably gives those sort of people reason to think twice about whether they would pursue the option and it still leaves those that have a genuine medical disposition to to follow it through so i won 't support the major and I think I 'm probably more inclined to go halfway when it comes to the advice for the Mercer the medical office of eHealth that kind of is sealed with that the staff recommendations and I think to go go Australian widened widen the criteria from soul to major just potentially does open for some floodgates however I and I think the term soul makes it really clear that that would be one cause that and that will be the reason you would cap down trees and clearly they would have to be for genuine cases with that single cause I 'm certainly as I 've indicated not going to support residents having to pay half of that I think for a genuine k where there are genuine cases and there are that this council needs to be clear about establishing principles were an effect we have one rule for rich people and another all for poor people so I 'll be very against that part um Tim and clean thank you sorry yonni was on that max to thank tell me anything as it 's not a monologist amongst us firstly if we change the really from soul to major be real shame was perhaps not the major cause or if it was the major cause it 's not the sole cause and although it may have reduced the issue the issue are to that family that individual is still there so I 'm not going to support their change with regards to the cost of the removal and replacement of a tree I support originally and I still do the 50 50 but perhaps in the future once this is reviews reviewed and 12 months we could look at a possibility of means testing but I do think that individuals who are affected by pollen or trees do have to take some responsibility to regards to the cost of removing it because it 's um James said that is the rate payers money the every right pound crisis will be bearing this cost so we have to have some form of responsibility so I will be supporting the 50-50 first stage thank you clean I 'll sorry yonni up sorry i 'll call Yannick first yeah thank you um I think it 's unfortunate to get into a debate about rich and actually want to live in a city where we can give people the opportunity regardless of which neighborhood they live in to be as healthy as possible because actually it saves us money it saves us money as Society maybe not directly to counsel but probably to the health system so you know I support us taking this approach in terms of looking at how we can actually remove these silver birches if it can be proven that it is a major cause to the issues that people are facing and I think you know you have to have some reliance on the medical practitioners to actually be providing robust information to justify that so I agree with the comments made two sets of soul calls as just I think at ISA is far too high and will be very very almost impossible to me so I support trying to make steps to make our city more healthy for everyone I support changing the word from soul to major and I have confidence that the medical establishment will actually the other ones that will have to make the judgments around what they what they come up with I won 't support making the applicant pay entirely for it I do think that we should have a system in place by which you know it that cost us either shared or actually taken on by counsel given that we 're the ones that put the treason in the first place and if it 's proven that they 're coercing a healthy a health issue then I can 't see why we should be absolved of responsibility for work for a living them so I would support us actually incurring that cost and totally support during the review in 12 months time so thank you and so I 've got Glen and then Paul thank you my view on this is that it I consider it quite reasonable actually if the trees are on council land that the council would pay I do take Jamie 's point of course that tracks all the way up we 're all ratepayers but for me here I think the issue is about the efficacy of it if you want to actually stop the floodgates opening tough so you set a high bar so you make it the sole cause we 're not the experts we leave it to the experts the medical experts to actually determine that is that the soul calls they make that call it may vary from case to case so I 'm actually I won 't support the second part of tickets on council land council pays and number one we stick with the sole points so Paul OMG i wanted to cool a point of order it 's just I didn 't want to do in the middle of the speeches because it was a bit disruptive so that I 'd wait to the end but a point of order of what I was proposing with the full cost i think has been misunderstood I 'm not disagreeing with anything once in I actually am agreeing no no IIM a great no at the point of order is that people have got it wrongly debating same way but that 's a spacing meter at center point of order sorry well the point of order to ramble you 're in the always know when somebody 's trying for a second crack Paul okay rivers shot then debris actually suffers as one of the worst cities for actually pollen because of the winds because of the belly style geographical survey Trivette of our city so I do not want to see our safety open the floodgates to actually mass removal of trees because I know that civil butchers are have some issues around health but they also have issues around people 's property because all the stuff they drop they drop stuff every two or three months I 've had a salute street and they are a bit of an issue for people to some you noticed maintenance around their home so some people will less you use that to actually you to remove these trees in it and I do not want to see a mass removal at ratepayer cost so I 'll make it as hard as possible so I will be supporting the epic and pay you full cost if that fails or he going for the 50-50 I do not want to see us actually changed the policy paid for the removal and I think yannis writes a lot about rich in pool as without doing the right thing for our ratepayers because at the end of the day the right players do pay and some of those people actually do struggle to pay me right so we 're just going to keep that in mind as well to me yes unsub closed the half half because why that I was told although the handle of the silver birches fee was plenty back to the 1989 which means that before the City Council combined together I love you all those the treat in the different kind of you know the area and also this treaty based on the kind of the reporter HR easy to cause the people and the energy or eighth Mark residual so if we go with the applicant to pay a hungry person I think probably unfair you know for neighbor or a hundred percent pay by council sphere unfair so I have and a half I think that 's reasonable and especially the you read review staff the recommendation 7.28 really this kind have a kind of GP we have email knowledge East as well as a chief medical officer of Health they have kind of give the comprehensive scientifically no qualified Aleppo whether this every kind is qualified or non-qualified so this asterias asteras whole quite seriously so and also this tribe for within a 12-month only it 's not a follower for a long time so we got into amendment I 'm not support member i pay for to pay to the original recommendation thank you I think that 's everyone I just want to just make a couple of points the Boosters is that this isn 't a policy to resolve the issue forever this is designed to give a mechanism whereby community boards can make good quality evidence-based decisions as best the evidence can provide at the moment that 's actually why i support refs amendment to change the word to major rather than so I think souls too tight but that 's also why i support the 50-50 I think there are other ways that we can resolve people that can 't afford who meet that criteria and need a proper review of the whole policy so this is an interim policy once so it 's so important that we do this review and 12 months time is that there is evidence around the links between particularly the silver birch and its related trees in relation to the impact that it has on on people and that is why the council no longer plants them so we 've actually taken our own advice and that regard and we have to think about the trees that we currently owned and I think there 's over 4000 according to this paper about where they are and what impact that they haven 't know if you if you make it the sole cause then as has been identified again and exactly the same literature rye grasses are a major contributor so and given the distance at which this pollen can fly you know it makes it extremely difficult for people to be able to prove the sole cause so it might infect not be assisting the community board and exercising its judgment and an interim period based on the evidence that 's been a really interesting debate and I like the fact that we all take these matters very seriously and I think everyone 's made some really good points so on that basis I 'm going to run through each of the amendments the first amendment has been moved by Councillor mangie seconded by myself and that is that the words soul is replaced with the word major and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no right so we 'll have a recorded vote we can pop that up and it was good i think there 's the it 's the first time yes um I think Council on stone harbor but can though I was confused I think I voted the right way but we voted took the same way but we had a different view so um I don 't quite understand how that happened okay well look can we clear the screen I 'll just don 't vote again the relation for people this is this is this is for the amendment that changes the word soul to the major cause or the sole cause so if you think it should be the sole cause then you vote no if you think it should be the major cause you vote yes all right is everyone crystal clear yani are you clear if you want it to be the major cause of the applicants condition then you vote yes and if you want it to be the sole cause you vote no that 's right yeah right oh ok ok well it 's let 's have it on let 's have a look at what because a motion that is as you know equal retains the status quo so it becomes Eve 's that as the sole cool so so if you could vote yes or no this is the same one we 're doing it again just to be just to be clear right so it remains the sole cause it doesn 't it doesn 't it 's declared lost so right so the second vote is an amendment moved by yes that by councillor goth seconded counselor mangie that we replace the word Council basically with the word pay for the cost of removing and replacing the trees and it is not shared or the council 's responsibility but it 's up to 12 months yeah that 's right and it 's reviewed and 12 months time so if we 're all agreed to the 12 months so if we found it was a problem council get share it 's a good try it 's a good try it 's a good trade um I will put their amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no yeah I declare it lost does anyone want to help their vote recorded in favor you want to put it to a diversion okay but they want to plug the machine switch it back on they go you got one more so I declare that lost the next amendment is to replace the wording that has all of the cost share arrangements with it and yeah but it still has the 12 months review so it 's the opposite of the last one the last one was yeah it says it 's a foreshadowed amendment so that 's for which is the 50-50 and if that is lost then it goes to the foreshadowed motion which is you know they 're not have to put 7.7 separately which is what i suggested in the first place I thought the usage is something quite sensible thanks for the advice now oh so you mean you were busily gospel okay it 's yeah okay so it 's now a current amendment it 's no longer foreshadowed it is now you don 't know you and you can 't move it because you move the main thing so we need a mover and a seconder for the motion Glenn Livingston le Jones so i will put that amendment all those in favor say aye its exact opposite who was the second up jaani jaani johansson right so i 'll put that motion all those that amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's lost shall we have a division division it 's called for okay I 'm gonna that would call for a division he said dead yeah who hasn 't voted everyone 's voted who Oh put the substantive recommendation that the substantive vote and i 'll put that all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and do you want your opposition recorded and record android tuna voting against thank you thank you very much and thank you obviously put a lot of work and for that how are we going come on hmm i don 't know what 's the next you I 'm just trying to work out whether it 's best to break for lunch now and come back at two o 'clock or whether it 's best to wall all the wonderful oh yeah so look I 've bought a June now but what we may infect come back and deal with one of the public excluded items first and so we may be starting the the main meeting of a little bit later but I 'm just wondering how I can I mean I 'd have to go under public excluded now and and then if we don 't use that option then we can cut week and come out of public excluded when we into public excluded for the purposes of item _"

  {
    "text": "which is one of those supplementary agenda items sorry sorry we 're just going to take some advice because there are two parts to a report one that 's peaks and one that 's and the open session and so I just need to yeah yeah yeah so no no we 're just going to get some advice so just include alright so we 'll deal with them item the first part a item which is the record on public transport hub because it there 's a px element to it it might be better to actually hold that over until we get to the until we get to vote towards the end of the end of the well as we 're about to go under PX it might be better to deal with it the enviar on the agenda is it all right okay so we 'll defer item one the first part i item on this report and then so we 're on to trees and health issues page six four six eight I think on these very long agendas we 're going to have to have page coming up on the screen for me but for 68 right please okay so um so Phil you would like to move this and young would like I 'm a second it well I 'll move it yep and speak to it right so here we got staff that are available for the trees and health issues yes the kalenjin Rutledge its page 4 6 8 as the beginning of the report and a recommendation as on page 47 747 627 477 and there 's a committee recommendation and a staff recommendation with some amendments so did you move the committee recommendation I 'll move I 'll move it as a each year yeah yeah okay so all right so here we got questions or do we want to have some commentary to start why for look I mean the committee 's already dealt with us so why don 't we just has anyone got any questions they 'd like to put to start yes rare so how do you define a clinical immuno and immunologist sorry could you repeat the quiz yet how do you define a clinical immunologist we define it we would defer to the DHB and how they 'd upon it where you must know the pad you must know if you 're making this recommendation um the author of the report should be on his way so I have to just defer that question we get notified him at itself yep no that 's good and you weren 't expecting it to come up because you probably thought there was going to be a lengthy debate about her record on transport hub right yes so that 's good Jamie then yani yeah what about distance from the from the residents home because when I 've seen as it 's been that someone has lived you know right beside this is that covered in there and we haven 't specified tree you know I guess the relationship between the tree and the home because of course pollen can lu can move quite some distance it 's why I raised that is that you know you want to be tied around others there isn 't yeah that 's the place of residency and you basically you can the trees in hit me park or a number of trees there you know you want it within a certain distance I would imagine to where they live or reside it 's it 's a tricky situation because of course we can only talk about council-owned assets and there may well be that particular species next door and a private asset and a private home so rather than try and determine zones we have we have literally confined this report to our assets so to speak publicly owned assets I guess though you know I felt from readers that it may leave it open if someone loves to go along now obviously if the analogy and the park was full of silver birches that 'd be silly to continue to go to that park yeah but it does really leave it open that if they can get a letter from the doctor saying that these trees made them ill that they could effectively have something that 's quite a long way away from where they live affecting them adversely Shane might like to add to the distance one of the is that given the extent of the vegetation that has allergenic pollen in the year at the same time a silver birch and the fact that there are other silver birch trees if we know if we solely talking about silver there are a lot of privately owned silver around the city whether or not that particular tree that they 're asking to be removed is the sole cause of that person 's ailment and whether or not the the removal of that tree is the sole option available we 're also asking them to confirm that the air are or are no medical options available included in the medical option as things like dietary requirements we 're aware that some people have of oral allergy syndrome but people with allergies to peanuts they don 't eat things with peanuts and people with that gluten intolerant they don 't eat things with gluten and so perhaps they could look at changing your diet if they had an oral allergy so medical is kind of loosely termed around there because this is this is a tricky one and funeral my Mary true and or is it a malicious rumor that there are actually are that the human population rizzens of christchurch people have there are more allergies to grass than what there are silver birches as anna grass area isn 't uncommon there is benefit bend by the medical officer of health and his comment is in the report under 4.1 5.3 grass pollens calls far more allergic reactions in Silver Beach is that that 's been confirmed by medical so is there a policy in the works to look at removal of the grass if people have and half of them no no jaani just I mean I 'm I think the staff recommendation wasn 't that it was 5050 about the committee had recommended fifty-fifty they I don 't know if it 's more appropriate question for the committee but did you give consideration to the people that you know if they couldn 't afford that and they had health issues what the impact would be we we certainly did consider that issue and for that reason I didn 't support then recommend that just the sum can be there is an issue in relation to affordability and that if an even if it 's for example residents are obliged contribute a fifty fifty percent clearly there 'll be many residents who couldn 't afford to pay for the tree removal so in fact the pup men my view the policy would be what if it 's 5050 will be quite unfair to 50 50 for the for the total life of that you know that 1200 or is it just for the removal which probably is around four hundred dollars it is the replacement as well and the life tending of the because it that thousand-dollar something 's gotta other costs involved in it as well it 's it 's got the first three years my dear space three years maintenance sorry yes where it needs a bit of nurturing correct yep Andrew given the advice from the medical officer of Health in paragraphs 4.14 and 4.15 and then comparing that with the paragraph seven point one of the staff recommendation and the committee recommendation is it not fair to say when the medical officer at out of to reduce allergic reactions for the following reasons and that 's the grass pollens and the ability for a small amounts of pollen to disperse over a wide area and so on is the bar not set so high that this policy is unlikely to be able to be used you know it almost seems that it 's unlikely that a person is going to be able to prove that a tree is the sole cause of the condition they 're experiencing so it 's unlikely that anybody will get something through the policy the working party that 's working on the tree policy feels that we should only be removing trees for health reasons and what they 're saying our rare and exceptional circumstances and until we sit down and figure out some clear defining of what that actually means then we think that this is the best way to go in the meantime which is why we 're calling it an interim policy but the intent of the wording between the two will not differ so we we don 't envisage there a lot of people will be there any other questions yeah dimensions only one question regarding to the Star Trek commutation seven on the SE with the committee add on one help I 'm here I just want to ask you whether this is review until my time is a partly on that yo yo Gil I think it is appropriate will be reviewing it between now again swing we put the report up to the council for adoption of the property policy yeah thank you yep please yeah sorry I think that review is a good idea because have you had any conversations with people who have removed silver birches to see what the impact has been no I don 't believe we have I think that would be quite useful information obviously in bennington y mari we 've had a quite a few removals and it would be good to get the evidence back to say I think they has this made a difference what kind of difference has it made ya look at that be part of that review that can be part of that review is appalling I 'm just on 7.8 kept its funding and i weeded out to be about a hundred and thirty thousand so how many trees does that represent you think the anticipating removing that would be just over a hundred a year and that 's that 's what we hoped would be the worst case scenario one hundred a year yeah yeah we 're hoping that that is the worst case scenario but until until it 's out there for a period of time we are guessing at how much we 're going to have to though I mean I just heard before that you think that wouldn 't be very many we are hoping that it 's not but and they wanted we don 't know so you want debt funding caters in case we give applications granted for 100 correct I 'm Phil thanks Joan you 've indicated like the rack there 's going to be extremely strict criteria and just I just want to clarify though that that the common total of that of 7.8 which Pauline has referred to in fact that 's the total that it would cost council and and 50-50 contribution we could estimate in fact the amount will be half of that it was correct we total would be no more that 's weak strong woman is correct and just can I point out that we 've been asked to remove 39 silver birches and ream stone drive and if we go down that track that will trigger a lot more requests citywide so there is a possibility that when we call them the floodgates they may open and Paul I just have to say I 'm a little bit bewildered by the whole thing with where you have a bunch of trees some and you could have a number of properties that have their own private properties so essentially the issue is not going to go away is it no but we 're going to spend a lot of money removing a lot of trees I don 't believe the issue is going to disappear when ken debris itself has a lot of pollen that floats right across the city with the winds and they come from all directions penny other one and to me this seems do a great deal now clean and then like Jamie my other question my question is in relation to the recommendation page 477 just about the reason ability of asking members of the community to go fifty-fifty so the recommendation above talks about trees on council-owned leaned I don 't know whether I 'm drawing the right parallel or not in relation to our pressure systems and help raise that issue is it actually fear to ask members of the public to pave and it 's on council only so is is that reasonable that we would expect people to actually have to pay fifty percent of the cost and so I might give part of the response perhaps I think in signaling to the public that there may be a cost that helps too perhaps mitigate the floodgates opening if people think hey I might have a crack at this because I don 't really like that tree it may not be anything to do with the house issues I think indicators like that may make people think seriously about whether or not they want to pursue it I to get money back the intent of this interim policy is to give community boards at all by which they can consider valid requests there 's two parts to it really yeah I can see you 've you I 'm just wondering it just sounds a bit but too cynical for me but that no I don 't think that 's fair so I think that the point that we 're we 're being asked to adopt a policy with some caution because we don 't actually know what the implications are and in the financial situation that the council faces at the moment I don 't think it 's unreasonable for staff to present an option that that considers you know that yet that considers that that there is a shared cost and the removal and replacement so I 'm sure that people are already thinking that perhaps with people who genuinely meet the criteria but can 't afford to make the contribution there may be another path for them to obtain support for for paying for this year but I think that that 's that 's the way question the proposal and the way that you have I think that would be a better way forward is to look for a solution to that problem rather than I think that staff have genuinely worked hard to try and find a mechanism to make interim an interim policy workable for community boards while the real policy has worked on Jamie two questions just for the chair of that so for you fell one is the intention around us that if this was exercised and accepted that it would be a tree for tree removal and replacement so they would say to silver birches that are removed in to appropriate species go in well my undersea it it has to be reasonable and like it may well be that two trees were removed in and it 's better to replace with one tree rather than having use a new species being overcrowded for example but they don 't make sense okay and the only other one is assuming this was passed whereas a 50-50 split do you think in Europe is announced this given you community board chair background do where there was a resident struggling having a really hard time with us that they could potentially apply to say the community boards discretionary fund for assistance with that other half or perhaps another Avenue I guess is always other avenues but I think we know that those other avenues are or always very difficult for people to obtain money especially saying cases like these and I would it while I 'm speaking on it i would say that I don 't want to support the last part of the committee 's recommendation on the basis that this solution really will end up being only for those who can afford it and clearly the criteria are really strong in terms of being strict around the the applicant would have to prove that this that this is the tree is a sole cause of the illness okay so well I think on the on the basis of that I should put the resolution yeah yeah I 'm going to suggest though that when we put the resolution that we put it in two parts that i 'll put 7.1 sorry i what i have in my mind with us is if you were going to put it i was going to debate it and move an amendment to it but like I want to get into the debate if it 's an appropriate to right now it is absolutely appropriate to get into the debate I 'm not going to put the motion I 'm just suggesting that I might put 7.7 separately because it is 7.7 as the one that creates the cost share okay so yeah all right yes i said above the balance of the recommendations 7.1 27.6 can be dealt with as one group and see my well seven can be dealt with well could I debate 7.7 then if it 's you know but you can debate them all it 's not it 's not i 'm not going to split up the debate i 'm just trying to find a way rather than people having to amend the motion which is essentially to delete one paragraph yep so on the staff recommendation 7.1 I 'd quite like to change the word soul cause to say it that 's moving an amendment yeah so you were well I mean let 's get the amendments on the table but i am going to deal with 7.7 separately so i thought by signaling that to you then if you don 't need to move an amendment to to try and change the wording of it it 's either for that Kashia or you 're not if we don 't have 7.7 in the cost lives with the council is that right probably see really my movement was going to be that actually the applicant pays for sorry don 't give too much away sorry I 'm okay bright all right well then okay that 's not going to work so so so reefers wanting to move that the words soul cause become major cause now it 's going to have to go right through out so well he might hear in a minute no no we will debate these so I 'm don 't don 't don 't don 't sweat the small stuff it 's perfectly an order for a counselor to move an amendment and is that require that to be seven point two point six I just think I mean it is at it 's impossible I mean there 's no way you can prove that yeah the sole cause of it Robin everyone out basically sorry right so so I will I will second that motion yep that 's an amendment so it 's been moved and seconded yeah are there other amendments that we want to get on the table so we can 't deal with the we can find a logical sequence so you want to you want to change 7.7 so that it refers that the cost is borne by the applicant I was wondering Leanne though it may be worth doing the 7.1 first and then depending on how that goes wait you know it 's relevant do you want me to pop up what I was thinking yeah I just um I 've got the words there yeah it just something says it 's everything that the committee recommendation has in 7.7 and it reads up until this point trees will be borne by the applicant and that is to it if I can briefly my rationale was alright and then so do we have a seconder for their amendment that the costs are fully borne by the applicant that fails for the want of a seconder Jamie I 'm sorry that fails for the want of a second one earth would you have major cause of year I mean why would you want to have any criteria the applicant was going to pay for it all no because I don 't want just people that have got a bit of cash in the bank that don 't like silver birches to be able to remove them willing of it and have them replace any of them revised it is well whatever tree remote appropriate species in the area fruit tree perhaps if that will help sway the council right okay so we 've got that one moved and seconded but I don 't like its chances given I couldn 't find a seconder when you were talking to each other if you let me tell you you may realize that you 're a really what the persuasion is I 'm sure so and are there any other amendments to the because there is another one around the 50-50 isn 't there so that up that we delete the part and so so that it just simply says story set borne by the council well actually it 's exactly the same as the Gulf mangie won 't accept that the word applicant as the council so if you can cut and paste 7.7 and and herein lies the problem because because you have moved it you can 't really move an amendment to it can you so I know yeah yes so their daddy daddy issues so so I 'm just trying to work out what is the best order to deal with the man I mean I 'll deal with the major first the gervais EG i was looking at six point three point two and because option two is the one that is being recommended that information doesn 't appear to be being included on this up mustard and i think that that information from an m4 mate listening make sense but that information for the community record-keeping and keeping an eye on outcomes and I just wonder whether that information six point three point two can be included would anyone have any particular problems without being included in the action to know it 's not an option to that is not one yeah okay so the whole of 6.3 can we have that as part of the part of the staff recommendation knowing part of the actual that the recommendation so I actually think six point three point one as slightly problematic as far as a timeline goes and might stretch out the the process so my room but this is this is asking that to ensure they 're all pending and future reports to community boards relating to tree removal requests contain the minimum of maintenance follows so if not six point three point one my focus was on six point three point two I think six point three point one is slightly unnecessary as far as it directly protect attracting a process i think it 's just it will make it more difficult but i do think that the information in six point three be able to make an informed decision what one refused to treat me if I 'm wrong but then you better throw some herb it 's already--as up to date advice from the medical officer health is dealt with and 7.4 so yeah but not the Met not the calendar and not no no no that 's right that 's what I 'm trying to sign what 's missing so right _"

    "text": "it 's my favorite thing part a meta good morning morning this is good morning isn 't it so there 's one pate for the first meeting which was the surrender of the lease its principal reserve which there were no issues with the surrender their links so would it this is surely Papa no it 's not yeah so Ellie Jones would like to move this and Pauline Cotter would like to see can do it doesn 't matter does it matter you 're not the same from here from here I see now my eyesight is not that bad I made it I made an error I looked at Pauline while calling you and I said councillor so you know let it let it go let it go right so are there any other any questions that that people here yonni really efficient for staff so we I just want to say because that 's great we 're going to form you the vice of sports clubs and organizations occupying reserves and local parks but because do we have a policy that applies to council land outside of discussion about the set the ball and some members actually voted against the sick time huggies there 's two parts to this or there 's also the part c which was about the actual lease of a new birth council land which is where the main part of debate came it wasn 't about this syringe in order yeah we 're not making that decision we 're making a decision to to surrender allow for the surrender of the lease is that right yes yeah so but it does raise an issue because of it raised an issue that was raised in the previous community board one which is a consistent policy around how we 're dealing with land that release whether it 's to a sports organization and whether that 's the same as a community organization whether that 's the same as an organization that receives government funding for the service that it delivers so you know that it 's a it 's an interesting one and then there may be a reason for the apparent inconsistency but without seeing a report on that I actually couldn 't I think that today 's meeting has actually raised a couple of issues that i want to give some thought to and maybe construct a request for a report that will enable all of these things to be made absolutely transparent so that we know exactly what we 're dealing with and why particular decisions are being made so I mean I think it 's been quite useful but that this particular motion is not related to the to the to the wider decision that that actually remains as part of a delegation to the community board and one of the questions that I 've been asking is are these the sorts of issues that should be also able to be decided by the community board rather than having to be referred to the council for decision and that 's another piece of work that we 've got going on at the moment is part of the bigger discussion that we 're going to have around proper delegations between what is appropriately council what appropriately community board with the hope that a lot more can be dealt with that the board meetings a little bit more interesting as well all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried there any other items on that meeting that you 'd like to refer to know so this will also had that your purchase or the lease agreement but obviously that 's sort of been discussed yes so we over the next but yeah episode it does relate back to page 78 where we list the financial implications but on page 83 you 'll note further to what you 've just said Liam that the board members questions at lease and structure but I actually voted against the the resolution around the cost of the lease and more sensible and I mean you don 't have to be a brain surgeon to see that you 're in a loss-making situation already when you have got Edmund costs of 250 plus GST but the the lease costs is 225 50 plus GST so that was apart from the actual structure as and how it works as a process there 's also the mean you 're making more than that anyway so that was why I voted against it I didn 't want to be voting against children and their families ever in Sofia and that 's why I think sometimes having a set of principles and understanding the nature of the framework and being incredibly transparent about the whole thing is actually the solution because then I mean then you 're not making a decision based on a whim you 're actually making a decision based on a clear set of agreed criteria and a factual basis for the decision that 's being made you know if all due respect I don 't think you voted against it there was a huge debate and that 's why we had that note at the bottom of it no I 'm pretty sure you voted we all voted for it but we actually put it but on the end actually get a similar in regards yeah to the whole situation because we realized there was a initiative and that seminar may in fact spark off the need for a you know the consistent set I 'm heavy receive on the temp went to the information that you 've requested and I think um I mean it 's really pertinent to our long-term plan and financial my line to board submission so haven 't received it I just think can we ask that think it 's presented and I think it would really be I mean I 'd really like to see it for our wall as well but what was behind ask me for that information and I just members of the board had seen works to some of the roads that didn 't really require it I 'm so just wanted to get an idea of what was actually implants we could go have a look at it and see if we could actually stop some of that workman dump it wasn 't required yeah yep good good um right so Pauline something else yeah sure on page 81 10.4 as you well know the shitty papanui community board is you to gain a leader and starting the evil garden awards and such as Stephen people know that our nominations are open now feel for you yeah so schools community groups even you know home gardens are all able to enter it 's not a competition it 's a recognition award so I just sort of it 's a good news story and it is internationally famous sir that 's right it 's been reported overseas and the Royal Horticultural Society magazine so the update on the melbourne park trick which soon the borders decided that we 're supporting they deliver a deputation miss miss me what mix 100k might ok so it 's appalling would you like to move that the report we received and that the reporters are whole be a doctor and councillor Jones seeking that i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we move on to the calls 15 _"

    "text": "I mean but we do have a partay met when it 's the map isn 't school 40 kilometers through our speed zone so this has been an ongoing issue and mantelpieces and people have seen the kimball live reports from a present the 30 kilometer our signs that the kids have put up with painted plates and on stakes around the community for a long time and while it 's not possible to do 30 kilometers there is a 40-kilometer zone proposed in web council to toe top that today our board recommendation is that that goes ahead it 's a real issue on the hill narrow roads in cars and lots of children walking to school so if the you said it 's not possible to do 30 kilometers even in those circumstances not for the school speed zones like this that 's to do is legislation there is that we have had deputations bet have said that having a 30-kilometer zone on the hill generally would be quite good like as a general speed here on out and you 're not allowed to do that either that at this point it would require so we Suffolk consultation I would are a lot of consultation ends yeah we 've had deputations on duty come to you know just normal Street zones around the area as well yeah neighborhood streets the center is because the you know the central city plan has you know now provision for its own beauty cave so and that in the central core yeah and there are cities overseas who have 30 commerce and neighborhood street just generally right throughout whole cities let 's try and it 's really effective in HD doesn 't cut down to people 's transport to work time of those kind of things by any more than a couple of minutes maybe we could ask the chief executive to follow up on on whether on what is the process for establishing 30k areas and in particular neighborhoods yeah and will be a thought on on what is the process that we 'd have to go through because I think it wouldn 't just been in your ward area that you don 't actually potentially look at hands are quite because the narrow windy roads but they also often only have footpath on one side yeah and sometimes no footpath at all on either side and there 's a section of road up here Billy 's Trank that won 't be covered by the 40-kilometer zone because it 's outside of those immediate roads from the school and staff are currently working on a way to try and do that because it 's a there 's a blind corner just before it where the kids have to cross the road and yeah it 's a real issue in this being a few close calls that 's great well we 'll see if we could get a report early in the new year we can do that we normally have a cycle of looking at the speed limits but we 'll see where we 're at and what the process is as a mere season and then we can time to women it would be great thank you very much excellent right so would you like to move this Yanni johansson loose seconded by Councillor lonsdale yes I mean not to also think Michael Thompson has been there traffic engineer working on that is really tried to find as many possible solutions for this complicated issue and you know I think the other point that hasn 't been seen as that is a lot of constructions there 's a lot of heavy vehicles going on in this area alongside road repairs and service repairs so it is really critical or we get us in place and we will continue another one bring this we can do thanks all right so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried there any other items on that agenda that you 'd like to touch on no at this point I think you is and Sarah the mouth isn 't memorial center that we saw gorgeous design solve yes what 's actually holding it up and let 's the first one and then I had one about the tannery after that I don 't believe there 's anything holding that up now they they still have at least least for five years and they 're because there 's a whole pile of historic issues over the lease that are yet to be resolved with the council and so are they able to start building they 're able to keep progressing down right okay second one the bus stop which was a fantastic looking design ground near the tannery where they wanted to put the bridge over as well gorgeous concept is that going to go ahead I say he asked you for the they 're going that we 've asked them with our staff to work with them on options that you will need to but they particular bus stop would be one not near the river on the other side with the bus route actually is now right so okay but ya knees got more information thank you to mind is doing that this piece of riders actually controlled by NZTA so I was going to flag just a resolution that basically just said that that the council requests the nzta to work with the tannery over the implementation because it just seems a no-brainer that they would not um all right that we tree but is also an issue of on garland road we 've got an existing bus stop which is no longer serving the butternut work to use it as a kind of taxi in coach yeah first of all since it 's already a kind of bus stop so rather just turn out to car parking which so but in DTF made it it 's the state highway as it yeah yeah go one 's right so yeah it would be good for us to put a resolution throw to request all right so Jana you 're handsome moves but he backs Dickens that that we request we request NZTA that the council requests NZTA to work what the tannery or actually just to retain but decommissioned bus stops sorry sorry to work with I don 't think okay I think sorry to request the retention all requests no requesting the retention of the decommissioned bus stop decommissioned less the decommissioned bus stops on Garland 's road on gallons road outside the ternary outside the tannery to become a designated coach of texas tend to become a designated coach and how 's that and that 's been moved by council johansson seconded by Councillor but and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and now counselor lonsdale will move and councillor johansson more second that the report as a whole be adopted and i 'll put that motion just like two other things that i think we need to bring to your attention one is just to acknowledge that we 're doing some work around the request pavilion with staff in the community so again bit like the UM the enterprise that we could from about little sermon terms of garage sale but an opportunity with the local community around a community project which is quite exciting and jelly I just want to make sure councils were aware of was that we have had a request from trees for Canterbury around their lease so the board did depart from council policy and set release at a more of a community rate than a stricter market rate recognizing the work that they 've done and obviously it raised a bit of a use council property and it sort of a little bit ironic that you know we have some other charges what professional sports that pay less and what community groups pay so i know that we 've also got another part of the agenda weathers dispensable as its principal coming around you know that so there is some work I think we need to do as a council but also just to acknowledge that Tim Jenkins was awarded a civic award last night for the outstanding work done in terms of trees for Canterbury over 25 years or sorry over a long period of time and I do think it 's important just to recognize the board supported this because of the very good work the trees for chemically we 're doing and the way in which we could help assist them we 're they 've got a really establish site in it just seemed like a reasonable thing to do so there is an inconsistency and the reports but and what they can take into account currently so we 're going to support and Rick they 're allowed to take do for the region but that doesn 't seem to come through from other departments and so I 've asked for some information on the consistency of what their age take into account when I seating releases so so you you were able to do this because of the delegation to you community boards for reserves as that right that 's right because it said it 's interesting because that 's that 's a policy decision that you 've taken as a board that doesn 't well has created a conflict with an existing policy of the council so that 's that 's certainly something that we should be noting and I 'll thank you for raising it yeah it may not be the best way to support organizations but we should have a consistent position that 's that 's something that we need to do some work on or I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we move to the records on what gram of community

center is an action from that arose from the little turd and master plan when the library staff first showed us plans to reconfigure the Littleton library building to incorporate service center functions I think it was fair to say the board was a bit dismayed to see that there was no board room included we did have a good board room and they looked in the old difference and service center which is currently being demolished and in an ideal world all the CCC services would be under one roof a bit like a little beckenham but this is a but this solution and the report today is a pragmatic one with some super center staff in the library some service center staff and the recreation center and the board and some of the board support staff in 25 canterbury street yesterday the community

synergy with it yep the garages and the Garrett I 'm a lot of comfortable with lottie 's vision of the community at our Creek I thought that was the crunch over me but any questions Andrew do you 're all good yani just um when you look at the diagrams on page 26 and 27 yeah it is basically the library is he going to be any use of that extra space that one of the options that was investigated was putting the boardroom and that in the basement of the library but the parent is too big columns that prevent a space big enough for a boardroom to being an entire space it would be two columns in the middle of it and so that was the main reason that in the mate in it that in a doesn 't seem so from the photograph because it doesn 't show the working men 's club building next to it but it 's actually a real of transparent setup that we were hoping to achieve did you consider um by the cost of refurbishment is probably about the same as cost of a new build did you weigh up just building on that 25 can bury straight and a new purpose-built facility versus really the only consider me I mean maybe staff can answer why or what they looked at yeah I mean for every other facility we 're looking at I mean I like the idea of support this location I understand the rationale but we 've been told that you know I mean we always generally get options around what a new build would cost versus retrofitting existing one to four things that operational maintenance lifecycle costs etc there should be a staff member that could I we did say we didn 't like the concept that was presented in the illustration and we weren 't sure that it would go down very well another alright Guerra Moses yeah i think the we did explore that and being a little tin the private of cost of foundation detail on the slope you really made so we 've been looking to a debt in reuse existing facilities noting that at the end of this will end up with an opportunity at the old service center site which is currently being demolished to you know this is an opportunity to see a sale or something beyond the trick so yeah we so long story short yes we did look at their cost prohibitive based on foundation and engineering details for a new building okay connect can I just clarify because i thought the garage sales story was quite compelling do they actually does it work in those carriages is it actually feasible to work i 'll introduce carissa who is actually the project manager and probably has a lot more detail on that solely to do the hello carissa pathetic we 've we 've started that conversation the big constraint there is actually resource consent and the requirements for parking but i think we really have an opportunity to work with project littleton to see how we can maybe make both of those possibility or at least investigate those options and if it 's not done so apart from the resource consent it is physically possible to use it yep this case that 's cuz there 's no safety issues with respect to the building or anything out there so if you look at the picture on page 27 you can see the three guarantee yes yeah yeah we were just concerned about the safety and well-being of the people working there okay i would have to know a little bit more about all of the constraints and the timeframes that there would be in the building and everything like that before I could give a complete answer to that but at this stage I wouldn 't see that as a problem in terms of the design that this is just an artist 's impression but you will be talking to the community about what 's appropriate yep because i think you know little chance got a an amenity value having previously lived there that would need to be taken into account and designing the right yep under facing well there are very strict guidelines on for resource consent to actually get that as well great the four hundred thousand dollars there is no queue is attached to the report so we don 't really know what hundred-thousand-dollar cabins yes at this stage we 're still really just doing the concept in the planning the for 100k was the approved value that council had approved on the 28th or 29th of august it 's right so that is the kind of maximum level that we 're going to spend and so what we 're being asked to do today is to reallocate a portion of the funding that 's already been set aside for a for the purpose of the integration with the library is it that 's part of what we 're doing there 's two so there 's actually a separate amount of money for the boardroom currently in the funding yeah and then what for the relocation of staff into the rec center to better utilize that space that 's where we 're taking the funding from the Littleton or yeah the Littleton service center integration into the currently ongoing rec center project yep and break from whom the retrofitting of the Littleton particular site by the garage sale yeah the board has made a submission to the district plan review to change the existing zoning which is residential to commercial to it but I think that would probably be advantageous for the for this use as well and that enable the continued use of those garages that is another one of the resource consent requirements or it would make it a lot easier yep right okay so that 's good and staff for support of a plantain aspect of the district plan right I don 't know so is there anything else I think that in future it would be better to put what the costs of the alternative would have been in the report itself because I mean I can accept also you know from a little time perspective that we know that the foundation and detailing requirements of those helps sort of slightly hillside areas that I 'm here bro knowing that there are challenges there that I know that sometimes it tips things well over the line very quickly even before you get to the above ground so but of view be good to have the amount actually written into the report I mean I 'm find a sports today but I would like some information about life cycle costs as well because that 's the other thing that we 've put into other facilities where we 've looked at what is the ongoing operational costs does it well except that we 've already signed off the amount I mean this is the original the original mount was signed off and there 's an that this isn 't it sorry it 's a partially a Rio Khepri that reallocation and partially new money so write it it was no request for additional funding make and within the budget the council approved as part of the tranche one priority projects on the twenty-eighth caucus and delivering an outcome and a result that clearly or suit all parties right so that when I have been in the original report all right the question the life cycle card so if we if we have an old building and we reach or further and when we get into sort of like ongoing maintenance we build which costs five thousand years to maintain or electricity exceed your life has anyone looked at that because that we 've done that other things like fishes dial and ricca done but we haven 't seen verse on we haven 't_''_597.44 done that specifically yet but what we 're also doing is as part of their renovation and retrofit we 're ensuring that the designers are taking into account the ongoing operational cost of the building so we 're we 're allocating materials that will help reduce the operational costs long-term it 's because that 's what you 're looking for but this should have been raised and August so that the this is the didn 't have reports in August it was just a counselors just put forward ideas and it was just a line there was one line it wasn 't represents madam chair though it sounds like this all slightly irrelevant though because at the end of the day we 've heard from Darren that is cost prohibitive to look at a new build anyway no notions it 's so I know we can 't is yannis raising a very good point actually which is that it isn 't just the cost of the foundations in the ground and the New York girls too it 's the ongoing optics that 's associated with a brand new building versus retrofitted yes ballasting but if a brand new building is going to be straight out cost prohibitive due to the foundations there 's no point really looking at the objects of what a new build would be anyway because that 's not an option so given that it 's a retrofit then you 'd look at making it as cost effective you hate both figures when you make the decision and what I 'm saying is we made the decision back in August cost it 's got all those yes yep that 's very good so legal for the border yeah um so Andrew would like to move the motion I 'd like to move but I 'd like to move it with a small amendment to paragraph 5.3 to add the words including consideration of space for the Littleton garage sale in the basement of the motion she does right is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you all very much thank you have you got another item Paula because we might as well _"

    "text": "now could we have BAM Lottie Harris from project littleton and if people could refer to item 8.1 littleton library retrofit the service center and boardroom options because it 's my intention to move straight to that item after this presentation good morning my name is Lottie Harris and I work as general manager for project littleton project listings and asset-based Community Development Organisation running projects and events in lyttelton harbour that build community connectiveness resilience and support sustainable living our projects range from the community garden to putting on the midwinter festival of lights running the weekly farmers market and amongst other things the garage sale I understand that this morning the council is going to be considering the various options for rehousing the littleton service center office space for council staff and providing meeting space for our elected community board and that the preferred option by both staff and community board is 25 can 't_''_80.549 be street i wish to say that I both understand and to a certain extent support this move what I do wish to do however is to bring to your attention the building opportunity since april 2014 25 canterbury street has been temporary home to a community-run social enterprise called the garage sale in essence it 's an op shop but one with a fundamental difference we project littleton manage the sales and run to a month as fundraisers for our own projects the remaining sales are made available for other community groups to book they turn up with their own volunteers sell whatever is there and keep the proceeds typically takings on a Saturday range from between 250 to 500 dollars it 's not a bad return for three hours voluntary work for the financial year 2013 14 more than seventeen thousand dollars of profit went straight back into the lyttelton harbour community through these sales last year 16 groups ran Saturday sales and more still have come on board since work at the littleton swimming pool cut off access to our building and the council were generously able to rehouse us temporarily at 25 Canterbury Street back in June I spoke to our community board requesting that they explore options for us to remain there as being at the premises had an enclosed much larger space meant we could all be open all weathers it reduced the heavy lifting required to open up it was warm and it was central we started attracting more volunteers we were able to open more days group bookings increased and taking soared since then work has finished at Albion square the fences have come down and our takings have climbed higher still as you can see from the figures the last three months have all been a thousand dollars higher than the same time last year Saturday sales are now booked up until jun 2015 already we 've been able to start offering Wednesday 's two groups to book and we have the potential to expand this further at our current location and it 's not just about the money there 's a real sense of togetherness of community ownership of people being proud to support it proud to donate to shop it 's building a sense that we can look after ourselves that we can make things happen in our own neighborhood by working together we share resources to by being connected we 're needed such as kitchenware to diamond harbour school tools to the new Littleton Men 's Shed plant pots to the community garden mobility items to community house it 's an example of a community working together to bring about real change it 's an example of a functioning successful social enterprise that I feel could be used as a model elsewhere in the city I would like to invite you all to come and visit us at 25 category street to see for yourselves what we 're achieving there but be warned though it is it is a treasure trove so you may you may want to bring your wallets with you obviously I understand the need for community board meeting space and office space and that staff and elected members wish that to be centrally located but i cant pretend that my heart doesn 't sink when i think of the backward step facing us moving back away from the heart of the town back to being governed by the elements back to being cold and damp reducing the good and the money that we can make for our the opportunities instead of problems and that 's when I thought of the garages at 25 canterbury street it 's almost the same footprint underneath as the building above in the same great location what if those garages could be turned into retail space the garage sale could continue to benefit from the central location and indoor facilities and the community board would quite literally have the community at its feet coming and going it has the potential to connect the council the community board community groups and the public to create a real vibrant hub in the center of littleton so i ask that you consider this option in your deliberations today I know it is small fry compared to much of what you 're tasked to discuss around this table but the garage sale is providing real much-needed funds for a number of community groups in littleton its security would contribute to their security that would mean a great deal to a great many people i also have a very small additional request and that is that whatever your decisions today you consider allowing us to stay at single day that we are in that location we 're able to generate more money for littleton community thank you to my microphone back on thank you very much and that 's a very powerful presentation and I think project this little turns just been one of the standout examples them of you know the community development that we want to see really throughout the city so you 're really a leader in the area so we really appreciate your contribution but now we 're going to move on to the item in question and and so now we 'll invite Paula Smith _"

    "text": "and is that okay is Lottie here yeah is it okay because then we could go straight onto the item of business so you can hear the council deal with that item of business thinking welcome thank you oh I 'll just remind you that we 're being live streamed so you could speak clearly for the and I think these are they should be a button in front of you just to switch the microphone on right there one there yep is it live five minutes should be team slicer yeah we had five of all of them yesterday were five minutes so yeah right good good morning and thank you for allowing me to speak with you on Bruce white I live in the South Christchurch and have no private or commercial interest in the area of the Dudley Creek catchment I 'll speak briefly albina see a ver a chartered accountant for about 40 years my work life has always been on the private sector in various management and consultancy roles in early May a few days after the last of the floods I submit I sent flooding and I won 't go into that because time is rather limited but happy to answer questions of course what has unfolded census of a story that really is very important more so than the Dudley Creek project it 's a story that I believe represents a systemic failure and the way the council conducts its business and I submit that the council should not be adopting the recommendations for the Dudley preferred option I suggested the whole planning and engagement process as faulty and reaches the local government act the Official Information Act and council policy and proposing the alternative solution and I expected a level of professional engagement I thought I 'd get the mini thanks Bruce we hadn 't thought of that option can we talk at cetera et cetera and then a bit of a discussion and that 's not what I got at all on the private sector we 're on I come from there is a greater real accountability driven by the need to an income and pay to pay the costs there 's a real linkage between spending and income and it really shocked me about this matter that 's the lack of willing to willingness to engage the lack of robustness and the process both in concept and analysis and in terms of the Official Information Act a Cavalier approach I believe we now need an independent review of the deadly Creek project and one that doesn 't involve the current council staff or the consultants Jacobs ello comment on the role of Jacob 's in the whole matter Jacobs is an international consultancy listed on the new york stock exchange they don 't have any new zealand ownership in july i had to quote the jacobs code of conduct in order to extract if you like an unsigned undated report very disturbing I looked at Jacobs core values here they are here downloaded off the internet three values where relationship based second value growth as important profitable growth is what our stakeholders demand and third value people are our greatest asset so that standard corporate stuff but what do those values mean what happens when those values are in conflict in particular Lee in conflict with each other what happens needs of the client in this case the residents and Dudley creek and the residents of Christchurch what happens yesterday I received a link to the Jacobs to see the report produced in a very short time I 've got three words for that report skewed vague ambiguous skewed because it 's hopelessly biased in favor of what they call option a vague not very meaningful no meaningful analysis ambiguous well I would say there 's what 's called a double entendre this is not a high-level report as in high quality it 's actually a low quality report the only high level aspect about this report is escalating costs and consulting fees we return to cost estimate this project started off at the order of 15 to 18 million and March the report said 44 274 million now where are we at 80 million perhaps 48 million plus thirty percent plus whatever has been spent to date I don 't know what it is but escalating costs so reports that this is a report that just doesn 't stand scrutiny in my submission and if I won 't be the failure to comply with the requirements of the local government net the failure to comply with the official information act or ligurian legume on issues of engagement peer review but I do have one sixth point that I wasn 't aware of at the time and that is this report here which I 've only been made aware of it 's the council 's policy on significance and engagement that you adopted two weeks ago and if I look at it at sears decision making and engagement processor processes are transparent and then it says engagement as proactive and inclusive accessible a two-way dialogue well that 's not my experience and when I turn further over the iap to spectrum of public participation what does that say inform consult involve collaborate and power that 's not what has happened here if the city is to be rebuilt properly the council needs to ensure all parts of the planning and engagement process are properly carried out the lack of genuine dialogue does not help so I edged the council to reject the current remediation scheme and what I hope is on with doing the job properly thank you thank you very much that 's that 's all the time that we have allowed but I 'm very aware that you 've you know put considerable effort into submitting on this and I 'm you know very very grateful and I know that when we come to consider that paper will be taking all of that into account so thank you very much for you and _"

those 46 signatories that signed a joint submission whilst I am speaking and I 've got some photos of banks Avenue and for those people who aren 't familiar with being 70 you for a walk and a cup of tea to have a look at in spent some time with us in beak seven you we have a mixture of both native and exotic trees to name a few we have protected kakatiya Cory todra as well as cabbage trees we have chill ups and Oaks willow trees from napoleon 's grave and lime trees planted by the original owners the task force removed many of our trees through the ax term of aggressive maintenance you will see some of those remnants in the photo many of their houses were built by well-known Christ you two people Ernest atoms and Stevenson family kenilworth is the oldest house now street at 114 years one of our neighbors owns four properties in another his own 30 neighbors that have not been red zoned have lived in the avenue for a very long time as a desirable place to live my own home banks would has been in our family for over fifty eight years whereas a neighborhood to meet on our green for our events it means thank you for the council you 've proposal we have a lot to lose for this proposal and we have really lost a lot in our neighborhood throughout through the earthquakes we agree that the council has a responsibility to identify and implement a strategy to reduce the flood risk to residential properties and what has become known as the flop tan basin and we wish to be supportive of the council in that task and we have the utmost empathy and sympathy for those residents who are affected notwithstanding the above we oppose the council what the council has put forward for public consultation as a preferred option in a particular we objected to the effects of this preferred option will have on our natural beauty and amenity of banks avenue in north parade sections of Dudley Creek we think that you need some more time to think about that impacts for being seven ooh and the one neighborhood shall not be adversely affected by the creation or what will effectively become a retention drain in a neighborhood there is natural beauty in value to the residents we believe that in arriving at this preferred option residents and has failed to properly consider and consult on all of the possible flood mitigation solutions open to it we have as a group been talking to the council since April and we also noted the submissions so if some other people I do also note that yesterday the flood bike last report was posted on the council website as a result of the consultation that has occurred we believe that in the absence of any detailed design will cost benefit analysis even on a preferred option the council could not feasibly at this time be in position of sufficient evidence to allow it to narrow the range of options in the way that it has for arson banks Avenue the bet the council could not provide any level of detail on the impacts on our environment which and how many trees would be removed we have many species of bird life that lever most countries and recently we have wood pigeons and bell words that have returned in an owl has also made home and being seven you without a canopy the beard life will disappear no modelling been completed has been undertaken all the extent of any media work to build up the banks has been explored this would bring into question the decision made on cost as the council does not know the full cost and this is a blunt instrument for decision-making we further believe that the consultation process on the preferred option is flawed and that the castle was failed to take adequate level of detail as to exactly what has been proposed as a result the community is not in a position to make informed comment the consultation period was limited and did not give adequate time for residents to engage professional opinions this could give rise to a percept or perception of predetermination we leave for call on the council to 12 further decision-making on the preferred option tomorrow to having identified more alternative alternative solutions to the flockton basement flooding continue to explore till detailed level of options identified state the council 's criteria for choosing which of these options is preferred with having regard to both monetary and non-monetary costs and impacts evaluate each of these alternatives against the criteria detail such as to allow the community to provide informed feedback make provisions for independent peer review and assumptions used an evaluation of each alternative and then come back and engage in public consultation with some sufficient time before making your final decision in 7s journey see today the declaratory judgment has come out this may provide some more information in mayor form and form another approach as you know drainage is not the only issue for these residents thank you I think of what we 've got two other people who 'd like to submit as well do yeah yeah yeahs carry on and then and then we can open it up to questioning yeah I 'm it does help councillors I 'm Yvonne linen and I 'm actually speaking on my own behalf but also other people and makes Avenue I 'd like to start by expressing my deep affection for the Dudley Creek and especially the banks have in your area where I 've been fortunate enough to live with my family for 25 years I first fell in love with the area as a young teachers Avenue primary school and I imagined how wonderful it would be to live in that gloriously wooded meandering street with a delightful Creek and bountiful birdsong yes thank you pictures are good as sometimes can happen dreams do come true our children along with so many in the area experience the delight of walking and biking to school down by the creek waiting along its length and their gum boots fishing exploring feeding duckling eels and seeing the wakes of Water Rats as they swam from the banks we enjoyed community picnics in the vehicle especially after the earthquakes when all of us in Christchurch came to better know our neighbors and bonded over our shared experiences I 'm sure that some of the legions of kindergarten primary intermediate and secondary school students in the area who use the Avenue on their daily commute have similar dreams for their futures what I want to express to you councillors is the strong feeling I have shared by many in the wider community that backs Avenue is a very special and much-loved wilderness area and Christchurch that once engineered felled and cleared hundred year old trees natural stream banks that provide sanctuary to wild creatures and insects weeds and wilderness this can never be replaced by landscaping engineering and naturalizing if you use google earth to magically fly over the central city today sadly you would see a much-changed landscape however not too far from the center there are a few notable green corridors banks Avenue would be the most notable one could say that banks Avenue is the jewel in the somewhat battered crown of eastern Christchurch but no longer if the council were to proceed with a preferred option we 've been living feeling alienated on an unheard despite assurances that we have been afford full consultation affected citizens have been asked to give their opinion on a plan that has been woefully in detail a cynic might say deliberately so at one of the earliest community meetings when it was thought that the freaking Bates Avenue would need to be widened to 13 metres when she asked which trees would need to be removed in order to accomplish this my neighbor Heather Hodges was told to her visible shock noted by council staff at later meetings this was downplayed to a significant amount of vegetation and some notable and protected trees at the same time as the width to which the creek would need to be widened was upgraded to 15 meters we were assured however that the council would try to save as many as possible what does that even mean as an earlier meeting graphics were displayed showing significant trees that would need to be removed and the stratum course that the wider creek would take these early concept plans deeply concerned those who saw them but despite many of us asking we 've never again been shown any concept plan beyond the idealized artist artist impression available in the consultation booklets we 've been told that designers would try to naturalize the newly widened creek as much as possible but that in some places it would be necessary to engineer banks where there were constraints caused by a roadway on one side however if private private property owners were willing to sell a portion of their land to the council they would try to naturalize those not quite the same as natural in the more restricted parts there would be engineered banks of timber or concrete which would be softened by planting those delightful schoolchildren I mentioned earlier some of those children respond to ugliness and the environment and sadly in their own lives by making the ugly environment even more ugly engineered banks will be a target for tagging lettering and other anti-social behaviour and who could blame the children if we don 't cherish and respect our why should they many other concerns arise how much vegetation how many trees which trees what does naturalized look like what does engineered look like which property owners will be asked for as indicated more laterally and chillingly required to sell under the Public Works Act all details seemingly that will only be able to be determined after the council has decided to adopt this option and the detailed designs can be done surely then it would be much too late for us at this stage to have an opinion on whether we want and whether we want this option or not how am I going for I 'm aware of the time I just wanted to say that I don 't feel that we 've been well served in the submission document that we 've been given in that we were given two options naturalized or engineered riverbanks of course those of us who don 't want this to happen in banks have we don 't really want either of those we want xserve to stay the way it is and you couldn 't actually submit the document without choosing one of those options we did actually tell council staff about this and they said it would be rectified but it wasn 't and eventually I had to create my own document and scented and so that I wasn 't forced to choose one of those options which I don 't_''_807.37 I don 't want to choose and I 'm sure many others didn 't either so that brings me to what we do want and what we 've asked for and what we 've still not got we 've asked right from the beginning of this process for the council to consider options that do rather than diverting floodwaters from Stapleton 's road to warden street and then to bank serve requiring the destruction of banks that instead divert that through red zone land to the Avon thereby preserving banks avenue we 've been told that there are people looking at such and what 's the result being a response on the consultation summary document stating that alternative bypass options are being investigated and we anticipate these will be reported to the council but will be unavailable prior to the closer consultation elected members will have a high level assessment available when making a decision and lo and behold at five-thirty yesterday just as I was writing the speech and having asked council stuff earlier that day when we might get to see this high level assessment and email with a link to it plops into my inbox it 's a little bit late I think I urged the mayor and councillors to do the right thing and reject this option at tomorrow 's meeting start the whole process again from scratch and do it properly do not be the council that gave the green thank you thank you mrs. Beck hello yes but worried about this option to just to make it brief it 's basically a presentation was here 's an idea no real detail no real evaluation but what do you think that 's a position as a resonant we 've put in we 're all in the business of dealing with the changing levels of Christchurch which includes a natural gravitation of flow of water in our waterways I see there 's a great risk in option to to move excess water from an area like flocked and say and create a serious flooding issues for another area like being said this is a at a cost of 48 million plus I 've been a resident of being safe for over 20 years and it has only been since the earthquake series that we 've had serious flooding issues due to land drop and to change of the water flow relationships it 's a very important one between Dudley creek and the Auvergne rua after the quakes the council immediately heightened the banks of the avin causing waterways flowing into it demonstrated on numerous occasions where in flight conditions the end of banks Avenue as well as other flooding issues where it meets the avin is completely overrun with river roadside Park cars having had bought an earring their window sills the worst of current flooding conditions caused the oven river to become indistinguishable resembling a wide s3 I know this because I stood there and waiting take it photo with photos of it Dudley Creek in banks have has a maximum flow of 5q mix of water the plan for option to introduce another four cubits of water and peak flood conditions this is a total of nine chemex q mix of water in peak flow conditions which is a flow of nine cubic meters of water per second in a section of backed up waterway approximately 800 meters long there is no way that this excess water can or will be contained and it will cause serious flooding this no matter how deep or why Dudley creek is dug out at nine cubic meters of water per second the enormous volume of water will not be able to be 've witnessed it I 've photographed it I have marked the remarkable height of the maximum flood level as it is now without adding for chemex of water to it this information has been offered to various council staff on numerous occasions without interest or acknowledgment Derek there exists a disappointing level of informed communication the only reason why bang Seb did not make primetime news TV news with unfortunate resonance like my neighbors with ankle-deep water in their homes was that they would that they had to abandon their homes due to quake damage so that we 're not living there there is a stretch of homes along the south side of deadly Creek uninhabited due to earthquake broken homes this is where the council had a little or no flood communication from these residence approximately two years ago after contacting the council about posts quake flooding issues myself a deputation came to my property headed by Michael guli also present was Owen sullen and a woman and with a board clip and paper after an inspection of my property and effectual update of the flooding he instructed his 's my property of error by the way as a test case in conjunction with a wider study no response was ever received even after several attempts to make periodic contact spending 48 million on option 2 and convert Dudley Creek and to what effectively will be are very limited holding water holding zone with 9 cubic meters per second of water running into it with nowhere to go due to a heightened heightened avin River and flood defies belief and common sense in just a few hours the banks will spill over with major flooding I believe we need to change our approach to this issue and simply identify floodplains and Men is the natural flow of water in a holding pattern until the oven river can catch up with itself and handle the water use the money to buy flood plane land and convert already purchase redzone land for this purpose for example look for red zone areas like the open-loop for example and form a beautiful lake as part of a floodplain management the planners need to go with a flow and in peak flood conditions and to be able to hold the water until you can this is an inescapable reality unfortunately the presentation of option two is a viable option demonstrates to me unfortunately as a surprising disconnect of current physical flooding events and the reality of water flow and flooding currently existing and Dudley Creek being said there are 48 million plus reasons to form and do the maths for banks AF Dudley creek but nine cubic meter of water flow per second and now it goes flood conditions that really troubles me 9q mix in 20 won 't go so that 's my I submission but thank you all very much and there are some time for questions but what we 'll do is obviously with the issues that the three of you have raised and I know that you are speaking for others as well as that will give us a very good you know starting point for some questions that will be asking the engineers tomorrow so it 's been an incredibly helpful submission I think the whole day has been very useful entree into what will be an important debate 'am I would like to say that my heart goes out to all the people yeah and also you guys because this is such a crucial decision you know make it yeah how to not waste money and make it work it 's a the same thing it 's money it 's money as well its people fears yeah it 's money as well and it 's also a desire to get things done you know because you know what people cannot believe stranded and you 've seen what the full retreat option is it 's its massive and so that 's I mean none of the options are easy options but you 've certainly given us some some food for thought and I think our engineers will be all all over tomorrow and we 'll we 'll have a really good discussion and we probably need to know we aren 't repair diver you know so we 're the other than a broken and a broken street as well yep and I do know being said before you go I used to represent the area I know you do I still do but in a different way yeah in a former life time and a former life is in biggs it 's cool right all right well thank you all very much and this is this a June right so I declare the meeting adjourned until tomorrow at nine-thirty am thank you I _"

    "text": "and whisker hi I 'm a on behalf of edge we read road not every road residents living on the on and near the louis and albans creek and we 're concerned about the flooding effects in edgware road which are worst and most frequent between Geraldine and Hill Street Hills Road and so we appreciate the changes that were made before the consultation for the inclusion of sant albans creek in the dudley creek planning it 's a big step forward for us and that included the proposed enlargement of culverts at slater street and hills road but to our minds we need to add the enlargement of the culvert at champions street which is the worst point we appreciate recommend a therefore we appreciate recommendation 9.4 which is to investigate extending work up to geraldine street you think that 's very important because the culvert at champion street is by far the smallest and most troublesome of the culverts and that stretch of sad albans creek and it actually decreases in size I mutually measured the culvert on our side of the street where our section is of a colleague a written another resident visited at the other side and it 's substantially smaller at the downstream downstream side it 's tiny it 's 1.1 meters if you can imagine up to two and a half cubic meters squared going through that hole it just doesn 't get there and it said it floods onto our property onto the street and all the problems that we that we know we know that the flooding is taking place three four five times since the earthquake including the earthquake itself prior to the earthquake our most senior resident who 's lived on sir norman 's Creek in edgware road for 82 years tells us that it never previously flooded across the road at flooded yes but it never previously flooded across the road these floodings are a result of clearly of the earthquake and so we see that the looking at that section between Geraldine Street that extension proposed by 9.4 is essential to deal with the flooding of two or three houses in that area around 257 a jury road that 's flooding into the houses threatening floor levels takes place whenever there 's a flood and hopefully may help to deal with a fountain of surge that comes up right above the culvert there in the center of each rear OD time to take place in fact in March it not only found and up but with that fountain and with vehicles going through created a huge Pato which became a combined health hazard for from the sewage and from the point of view of vehicles as well it could fall into it so thanks again for the progress and including the Suburbans creek and the proposals and the extension proposed to bring it up to a tree road the note taken of the submissions that we 've made and we look forward to the extension of the proposal to include the most significant and regular point of flooding in the sand Albans Creek do you think do you think it would be a thank you for that do you think it would be useful if the recommendation on progressing and vestigation included a reference to the champion Street culvert yes the fact of the as it stands refers to some dolphins Creek yeah just as an extension up to Geraldine stress right that 's right so so to both actually some Albans creep into the proposed all the teacher whole mystery yeah okay thank you it 's very helpful there any other thank you nope it 's brilliant thank you very much _"

    "text": "good look and thank you just to continue Jane Rooney in France said welcome Jane I think you 've got the sense of how this works and yeah I just have to look at how this week 's besides just like to thank that council for having this off and for all the work that and your staff that window yes I can 't change anything now okay so we love it I live with my family at 16 France save according to the leader data the low point of our street is at 14 next door where the flockton drain passes underneath the road the ground level rises quickly to the north south and west and a number of properties badly affected by flooding in our areas reasonably small maybe about seven h outside our house is a manhole cover for what I presume is the sewer and stormwater drains for the whole street we bought our house at the beginning of 2004 our next door neighbors have been here since 1994 neither of us had any risk of flooding noted on our lungs when we purchase and we our house and the twenty-second of debris this is our house in june 2013 and this was this year and fifth of March the Dudley flood remediation report notes that the proposed flood mitigation options will give no marked improvement but we and our immediate neighbors won 't feature in the cultural port figures for at-risk floor levels because we don 't have blood water to our house it just goes underneath however during these rain events our garages and cheats flood our cars are at risk you need to be moved to higher ground we have effectively trapped in our homes the novelty of this sort of thing is worn off do we need waders to get our kids home from school contaminated water it goes under our houses and it stays ever quite a while we spend a lot of money on heat pumps in dehumidifiers we 've had our sewer replaced but when it rains heavily our toilets for luck when it floods sewage from the rest of the street rises up through our gallery threat and mixes with flood water on our section this is the couldn 't clean off not my toilet paper no reported remediation option is going to help us and we expected to continue living like this we 've got no confidence that a significant rain event isn 't going to impact on our lives on an annual basis giving it already has for the last four years and this doesn 't take him to keep account climate change where does this leave us we know the flooding is caused by the air quakes we 've had survey levels which show between 2005 and 2013 Outlanders dropped 550 10 meters I 've given the council in eq see this information because we also know this isn 't a problem that the council and isolation should be left to address but eqc don 't want to fix our foundations adequately or raise our house and they appear to have no interest in fixing our land they were post proposed to replace 25 of our piles presumably without a building conceived why can the eqc send me to Silesia why can EQC go ahead and repair my house foundations now if I am naive council 's own forms say that an application for exemption to building consent for repair or replacement of a damaged foundation is to be supported by a confirmation that the site is not in a flood management or flat awareness area shouldn 't there be a hold on repair work in our area shouldn 't the council just put that foot down about exemptions and this area the flood mitigation work will not improve our risk of flooding we don 't know if we 're going to be further penalized by having heads of notice on our titles in the future what about our limbs are we going to be able to afford to ensure our house in the future how on earth are we going to sell our house the report says properties on for a disease are more difficult to protect if the costs are prohibitive to extend the protection what about other options there are only a few of us really badly affected and several rebuilds at least one is can 't see it alters further no we are the only under cap repair on our side we spent four years being in the too hard basket but we 've paid our rates and insurance premiums and are in this situation through no fault of our own we want to be able to make decisions and move on with our lives we don 't want to be financially crippled in constantly streams we just want to know what is going to happen to the people who are not benefited by any of these options who are not covered by any at risk floor group that might be contacted separately for the council I mean what can I happen to us thank you late arriving and obviously you know you 've been through yeah sort of Hallam bacon it 's a incredibly difficult situation for you I don 't know whether you want to respond to an equation some can you go back to the second to last slide because i think is that the seventh of us or the theater is number thirteen the it 's the it 's the form for the yep building thing because that I think contained within us that as is the only get to the supporting an application when an application is made and an application is only made when you 're repairing or replacing all or a substantial part and the key words for you are a substantial part you know and you know if you were I don 't know what the liners so that 's what you 'll raise today we will I certainly want to now understand what is meant by a substantial part because I don 't know what how many piles your house has and what 25 represents and sounds substantial to me but I 'm not next bit and so the question is are you able to continue with that repair work without a building consent and that 's the question that we need to us because we can 't require people to apply for a building consent when we don 't have the legal basis to do so I understand it but is the homeowner it 's our responsibility under the building act to make sure any work on our house complies with the building act yeah the homeowners response the homeowners responsibility registered architect to know and there 's no way my house is going to be repaired the way eqc expect to but there 's a lot of other people out there who don 't have the knowledge or the skilled and nobody is protecting him yes and this is the this is the issue I mean I a part of part of my reason for the delay is that the eqc declaratory judgments just been released so we 've been reading nation getting to understand it but it does it does you know it does look as if they they will be compensating people for the increase flood vulnerability so so you 'll be having another conversation with EQC obviously as part of this whole process and as you say we are part of the solution but not all of the solution and I think EQC have really got to be included in this picture as well so I don 't know whether anyone has any particular questions that they want to have stone I 'm very mindful of the fact that this is an emotional occasion for you so 'm just because I cry it as a me know okay no no no no I 'm not so that before I 'm justified sri krishna okay jaani well i just want to thank you for making your submission and you know i share the concerns that you have raised and many other communities around the city as well there are other places in the city that are in a similar predicament and i do think it 's important we have an answer I just I mean is really a question for staff just the issue around consenting which is one that I raised with what we know I 'm wolf sternly places we 're getting lowered so not not even raised but but if she lowered surely we 've got some art sir to what we can do urgently given what we 're hearing again today there must be things we can do any I think that it 's a little unfair because it 's it 's what I 've just seed it depends on whether there is a legal basis for requiring a consent to be assured we not legally required but surely we can talk night oven now what Jack yeah but lead us yeah yeah okay yeah I it depends where your what you consider it baby effector but I 'd say this there 's four there 's four houses like ours that are old term on files there 's and there 's three house on a rear section and a 2 flex that are lower to the ground and it have had water through them so from my perspective we are the worst affected people in our area and across the road one or two how does this not good but you know you can still they still don 't have the risk of their car being damaged win it and a one and 10 event say right well I mean we 're going to have to move on because we 've got a number of them deputations to get through up with we 're reviewing this whole deputation process it 's it 's difficult because some people are seeing it as part of the submissions process which of course was was what we 've that was finished we are very aware that there are houses that are being required to be repaired and areas that are now exposed to our vulnerability that they didn 't have before and it 's because we can 't assume we can 't require them to apply for consents so that 's the rock and the hard place and opposition and we thought that we might be able to address that through the declaratory judgment which we we in the end we didn 't pursue the claim because if you see changed its policy but the court ruled that that increased vulnerability to flooding is with respect to the damage it does to buildings is not in itself is quite related damage under the eqc legislation so it doesn 't it doesn 't create it with the building but the eqc can compensate for that total for their total cost in terms of the reduced roost reduced value but look there 's more work to be done we are very mindful of the people in your situation and and as you say there are others and we are working can come up with a with a package that works for them as well so we 're not you 're not forgotten and we know that the extent of the works that we do is not going to be able to protect each and every property but if we can get to a resolution everyone who 's a rebuild can of course build to the higher level so it 's really a much smaller group of properties where the exposure comes from the fact that you 're not rebuilding and we 'll find a solution i 'm confident that we will thank you thank you _"

    "text": "should we have a cup of tea is Joe Boone hear from you so we may not start it right now or just I 'm going to look at I know other counselors didn 't want to be here and probably on their way so you just wait a minute we 'll just check out we we are twelve o 'clock unfortunately Joe in that case Joe why don 't you just start we 're through pleased to hear you yes good morning I 'm here on behalf expansion casta reason it 's Greek sorry daddy um no look I think people are being informed that Joe is making a deputation she 's asked her to proceed because she 's got a time constraint she 'll be sorry sort of beef lasagna and I 'm here on behalf of the throttle casa residents group we 've got over 170 people on our mailing there 's probably over 150 families living in area and the streets listed up here we 've also got other people across the city who are also featured by flooding just a happy reminder of what we 've been living on behalf of that group I want to say huge huge thank you to the amazing staff at council who had been helping us through those hideous process and you know the drainage staff the communication staff the supporting the council have done a fabulous job with our community and we really support the honest and transparent communication with us because there 's been a lot of difficult things has to have to deal with it we appreciate it right so over 150 families and there is no clearly preferred majority position within the group and some of our worst affected residents still favorite reach and they just want to be able to move on with your lives lot of residents have see that they lack confidence and their proposed drainage works and some of the modeling we 've seen shows 10 centimeters less water and say characterization a major event for a lot of houses that would all still be through their homes for resident that 's not a solution and I see in the latest release it looks like it may actually be better than in their homes and one of the things residents had some concern about was the equalist at the floor level data that has been used by the council and we believe we 're spending over 50 million dollars and Christchurch to remediate clubbing in our area we should be getting really accurate floor level data and results have said that they 're really happy to open homes so that accurate survey and can be done one of the huge issues for our area is that they proposed flooding works won 't improve the ground water table that the earthquakes have made that incredibly high you know when it 's we 've had a good dress stretch at the moment but limit sweet you know the water tables just below the ground and the drainage works aren 't going to help that and what 's positive is that they said that they enhanced option two will have some positive effects on some groups like people in each where Hills Road so it 's really great to see but you know we want to know what 's going to be done for Rena means you can 't live with the ongoing risk of flooding in a two of three main event it 's just a nightmare and a lot of reasons if they still go through option one because it was future proof that could cope with more events god knows what they might be hopefully not but you know that did provide that ability but we have been told that this does have the ability to have pumps edit at a later date of mystery so Joe Tom oars is another two minutes thanks Brian I 'll be done okay and yeah issue targeted rates was suggestive in the first report I see that 's now going to be targeted rates across the city which is not a popular option of course with the recent city but we really believe they 've targeted Simon already vulnerable group of wizards would be just tragic and who should be paying for this ironically the declaratory judgment was released this morning doesn 't look that hopeful but it 's more progress and I think for the people in our area it 's a big issues across the city when it consistently requirements to protect homeowners know people have had surely foundation we 've done on their homes through insurers that has it lifted their houses to a safe area which has left an ongoing burden on the city which is wrong now residents are unable to raise land because of resource consent requirements if we were able to do that would have more options to protect ourselves long-term at counselor we want to be able to live and a safe dry warm home just like anybody else on Christchurch heads of notices things like that we 've got all these things that we don 't know what 's actually going to happen to us we 're still making some decisions without enough information free time thank you Joe Joe can I just ask you a question relations of us to a report where there 's a reference to the I think it 's the warden Street cut through very proposed cut through just what your views are into around there that 's another thing that we feel very sorry for it as the results this is going to completely on the environment and you know we know what it 's like to live and a your home will it 's been impacted by something negative and we don 't want there for anybody and I really like the idea of the council continuing to look at different options for drainage and water retention areas and I think you know central government was to make some some of the weeds own land area available maybe they will give us more options but again yum that 's something else out of the council 's control but would actually help and this whole decision-making process thank you Joe other questions from councillors your submission has been really clear we 've got a full report to so Joe thank you very much for your edification and giving us your views and you 'll your PowerPoint points _"

    "text": "would you like to come forward thank you thank you anyway Chancellor Clearwater and counselors thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about two very important issues the record on public transport super stop and the cycleway on to M Street which is part of the accessible City I 'll focus on the wicket an issue and then just some comments on the cycleway Environment Canterbury strongly supports the proposal to provide a passenger waiting lounge at 123 125 raglan road with four bus stops on either side of the road this is urgently needed to support the new metro bus metro bus route which started on Monday the eighth of December Westfield riccarton is the busiest suburban bus stop in Christchurch second only to Central Station in March 2014 over 3,000 but passengers boarded their everyday the current facilities at riccarton are unsafe with no be safe pedestrian crossing narrow footpaths short bus stops and lack of shelter and limited seating for waiting passengers this needs to be improved to cater for our growing passenger numbers the new metro network focuses on fire frequent bus routes travel through riccarton because it is such an important destination in our city the number of bus routes traveling along riccarton road to the central city has reduced to support the agreed vision of an accessible City this means more passengers need to change buses aggregate and to reach the city so quality passenger facilities and needed urgently we commend the council for developing this proposal we believe it is the safest option that council have considered with excellent pedestrian crossing facilities at Division Street the corner site chosen by council is a great location for a passenger lounge as it is a high-profile site with good visibility for the public and approaching buses it is well positioned in the heart of the Riccarton brick business area so it takes people where they want to go We strongly believe this will support the local businesses by taking more people to their door and a crease increasing foot traffic in the area so people don 't just shop inside the mall this is much better than the previous idea of providing a facility in the westfield car car park which would shoppers we strongly recommend that the council should also include a small cafe within the passenger lounge so it is well integrated with the surrounding area this will make it an attractive and convenient place for passengers and other visitors and will also provide passive surveillance to create a safe and welcoming environment these improvements are encouraged to encourage the growth of public transport as our city rebuilds every successful city in the world has a strong public transport network at its heart and this is what our community asked for after the earthquakes we have a great opportunity to deliver this with a new metro network but we must have quality infrastructure to encourage more people to use public transport in the future riccarton Road suffers from considerable peak congestion which will worsen over time public transport has an important role to play and relieving this problem by reducing the number of cars on route public transport benefits the whole community not just the people using it by reducing traffic and allowing people and freight to move freely which helps the economy grow it 's been disappointing to read media recently we carry a wide range of customers from all sectors of the community including many full-time and part-time workers students and retired people forty percent of our customers would travel by car if the bus wasn 't available so they have travel choices and are choosing to support public transport for a variety of reasons and our annual passenger survey ninety-eight percent of customers say they feel safe using the metro network so the public perception in the media are unfounded overall we strongly support this proposal and encourage council to proceed with these improvements as soon as possible so I 'm happy to answer any questions before I move on to the term Street cycle okay just part and accessible synced Amy Margaret so councils any questions regarding the record on bus interchange Jimmy key issues the first one because we review the information of a consultation regarding to location one is a funky to always feel more the other one is the current or you know the kind of one candy 31 25 weeks in law looks like that you know a post I mean repost them are posed by this 173 almost a thirty percent so what is your point of view whether this location steer the the best of location if I could comment on searching I think the overriding thing point is the safety which sometimes when people responding to these issues don 't really think about the the safety and the safety of this particular site is so much better I mean multiple times better than the other site and it 's a sort of thing that needs to be considered in immediate responses don 't necessarily take it into account so I think that 's the explanation second question that are regarding to the current it 's either popular in northern part there where have the a tocar power be removed in thousand pal will be night total 70 so how is your point of view how to me the media that is kind of the capital remote remover to affect the business sorry I don 't have a view on that I mean there are experts transport experts within the City Council who I 'm sure can respond to that Yanni um thank you for your reputation and I just wanted to check with the change to the bus network yeah people that within the past few buses now take three so what 's the kind of increased time that people would be waiting have you got any information around around that not detailed but there are some people are taking one and so their journey is enhanced I think the maximum number of people who are having to change buses is twenty percent of the total Petrovitch so and I 'm not aware of how many having to take three so the number of people who had to change was definitely taken into account given full consideration when this model was set up that twenty percent there they will have increased travel time but it might be of the order of five or ten minutes okay think thank you i 'm aware council you 're handsome that in fact Dame Margaret and Commissioner X women 's have ten minutes in total and I know that they also want to speak on the other issue so Pacifica put that question bit short of time I can assure you that you know that should be opportunity for further discussion with whether he can around the the key points that you tell us now thank you very much the term Street cycleway Environment Canterbury strongly opposes the proposed cycleway on the north side of two M Street which will cross the entrance and exit to the new bus exchange we have serious concerns about the potential for conflict between buses and cyclists which could result in serious injury or death up to 50 buses per hour will enter and exit the bus interchange between six a.m. and midnight every day this will result in up to 100 buses crossing the cycleway every hour our previous that the design will also put additional stress on bus drivers by placing them in a risky position where conflict grew clear our previous experience with the bus exchange a literal street was fought would say it was fraught with safety problems due to the Contras flow bus lane which crossed the footpath at bedtime Environment Canterbury was assured by technical experts that it would be a and buses as we feared and we must learn from these lessons and ensure the new facility is designed to the highest safety standards Weaver 's recently we have seen a recent audit by a burly transport consultants who recommended that the south side of tulip street would be the safest so Environment Canterbury strongly recommends that the cycleway on the north side of two and street should not be approved and other cycleway options should be urgently revisited through a joint workshop with all relevant stakeholders we have an amazing opportunity to create a modern sustainable city through the rebuild where people walk cycle and use public transport so we need to work together to ensure it is a success some gain about available transect thank you very much for being succinct and able to take your question but and keeping in mind though that we are going to be opportunity to talk further with he came particularly around the safety issues of it but you 've got a question you know just when we were discussing the cycle way down term street it seemed to be the term because of connections with cpit and and a whole host of other things and for me I think one of the compelling reasons to have it on the north side was really the safety factor that vehicles are used to seeing cyclists on their left do you think I 'm going to I think that is an overriding safety factor and do you think it would be possible to retain that and and work a little more around some safety factors signaling crossing or whatever at the at the bus interchange I don 't really want to compromise that integral cyclists on the Left safety factor worth checking it on the other side okay very briefly I can understand you 're coming the ably review looked at all those gave waiting to all those issues and sure the report can be made available to you and advocated the the North Side South Side TLC yeah and Yanni um I think it 'd be really good for us to you to copy that every report what we 've got an hour report is that the further review concluded that so native safety or cycle routledge ability advantages over children street and it goes on to to talk about it so it says the aspect of the review concluded that a southside facility might offer some limited advantages over the north side but the selection of a South business North routes overall finely balanced when mitigations for the exchange exits are taken into account so I just want to be clear we getting a different picture of what 's on that report as it is that report really critical of the northside facility in terms of safety yes okay so we I 'm sure we might get out of work since that report decide tomorrow when we address the notice the item supplementary just a very home run in terms of the Welling what accepting and Wellington recently which was you know obviously of great concern have you done any work looking at what they 've done in Wellington around bus safety not that I 'm aware of will check I certainly live in Wellington and I 've been quite shocked as all citizens have been at the number of people have bus system and I certainly don 't want it to be helping you thank you crying cute Dame Margaret and then I 'm sorry that it 's going to be the last question because quite a few deputation but thank you very much food as you can also comment though that I 've got a note from the mere that in fact we will acknowledge the Lisa that you have seen to the mirror regarding the sand provider a formal response and thank you very much for your deputation _"

    "text": "Mike Moore and Helen autumns you come forward so I think you 've got between five and eight minutes Thank You mr. chair and thank you counselors we will then be referring to page four six six four six and seven and four six eight of your border paper that 's the recommendation that came from our community boards extraordinary meeting where we had several deputations and made some minor changes to the staffs recommendation so our board asked for or supports the Westfield site both in the short and long term and recommend that negotiations with Westfield commence with urgency so that 's what we 're that 's what we 're asking for and if those negotiations are to fail then we we Rick our board recommended that the staff recommendations with the with the minor alterations be adopted we also suggest that temporal ends on the present site could be could be comma dated or considered on the Westfield site in the meantime until negotiations have been concluded and that the other thing that we would like to suggest is consideration be given to the to the proposed use of that building from a retail 2 a.m. to a passenger lounge may require that building to be brought to a hundred percent of the code because it is a change of use so that would alter the figures quite considerably I believe so really that 's that 's where we 're coming from we got quite excited when we see Denis the resolution that was passed at the by the infrastructure and transport in green environment committee and that is the recommendation that we 've got in front of us refers to the recommendation above so we 'd be quite happy if that recommendation above is the one that we 're actually talking about today so if it 's not we 're just still reinforcing our support for the Westfield site and the short done to the long term and that the resolutions or the the amendments to the staff recommendation be adopted and also that we look at a temporary lounge on the present site until negotiations have either been successful or not when we talk about temporary facilities on that site something more like a a landscaping planting in front on dem the front of west boundary end end Rickett and road but i think that would be a lot better for all of us admit as of actually the community prefer that site okay so we 've been told that negotiations have been commenced and failed and commenced and failed I 'm not sure where they 're at but well we 're asking for us for negotiations to continue and that 's the preferred site as far as their community boards concerned and that was a unanimous resolution Helen yes and i 'm just going to pick up on one small issue and that is cary street riccarton road and the therapy of traffic through that and there were three the residents were consulted there were three issues one the lack of access out of cary street so council has fix that so that 's good it 's left and left out the second issue was some of the parking at the edge of korean writer and that 's been changed so that 's good so the third issue and this is the more concerning they 're really concerned that more cars will turn off from riccarton road than to carry them go through a writer and connect with carvo road australian road it has currently our thorough fear and people are concerned that it that will be increased and the board did recommend and i put that in front of you that what you would do is that you we 're asking for that there be a review after nine months so the residents are concerned of increased flows through carry router the staff say that isn 't the intention it 's not what they want we can 't we and the residents can 't prove this is going to happen so the sensible thing would be to do a review at the end of nine months now I 'm not talking about a formal review you just have a look at this if it 's a problem then you would have a look further if it 's not a problem you just leave it so you might want to change the wording around that but that is the view from the residents and just speaking on that specific issue any questions I 'll ask is to machine first one the community boring or based on your recommendation support of his field site imposed a short-term and long-term peace and also recommend in or negotiate with westfield with the urgency yes but in here also in the last sentence IAM particular mention if further negotiation fair land up or recommend 0 to the establishment asian i just want to ask one first equation so the kamir Port Authority the Westfield is only one is the unique location all is only the is kind of a favorite location even negotiate with failed and you still would like to follow the starve the common Thank You Jimmy what we didn 't turn or counselor team what we didn 't want to do was to hold the process up and Julie if negotiations and I 'm talking about serious negotiations with a fail with westfields but I i 'm unsure of that with the negotiation serious negotiations will fail but if they do we did not want to be an awkward and hold up the process so and made some minor changes to those and that is what is immediately above your committee recommendation and if I was a cockney bus driver I would understand that the resolution the recommendations above the committee recommendation is the recommendations that this committee this council is considering thank you Mike 6 second question but review page 24 68 yes regarding to our infrastructure comic and also the environment committee recommendation do you think that goal is the commune upon recommendation or not that is on your understanding my understanding if I was a cockney bus driver in reading this report I would understand that the wreath at the recommendations that in 6.19 the above recommendations be approved that 's what I would see as the recommendations that are being approved that we were approved by the committee that 's what was on the screen at the environment and transport infrastructure and environment committee when that recommendation was put so that 's what I would understand things might for pointing that out well it originally that have been a staff recommendation but we can count that clarified thank you okay I for the information you put a front of us so with regards to the third paragraph their concerns from reasons as that carry greater will receive huge increase in traffic as cars turn african road attempt to avoid the bus hub this is already occurring many communities in christchurch over the last few years have really experienced red racing or running and so i 'd imagine what the congestion on record and road that dead as happy as you 've already alluded to this everything already we 're like it already yeah and with increased congestion on record and road that that is just going to increase and it will get worse and worse so are you saying that you feel that that the bus hub will add to that well it 's it 's a concern from a large number of residents now whether that consume as as as real he has has yet to be seen well look so we 're so what we currently does currently applying a living writer it 's currently a flow which which people mumble about that so that 's okay I mean it changes dramatically and that 's the issue well the concern is real because it 's happening already intently through our cross many many communities but I guess with regards to putting it error and an increase in blaming tab rather than the increased congestion as I suppose conjecture at the moment and it would yes it 's conjecture when treating li wen Hao hill road was closed off and it 's the road past boys high school and it was closed off for two months we had a real reduction in cars shortcutting rechten road because they couldn 't get on to takahiro so we have experienced a reduction as well it 's now back to normal levels thank you very aren 't chat with us salim with it you can I interrupt please no I 'm sneaking we have actually gone over time with your deportation so I 'm probably what listen I 'm going to ask you now to to finish and because we 've got quite a lot of other people make interpretations so certainly thank you very much so for making a deputation for both so am dome maggot baisley a commission Tariq 's Williams are here _"

    "text": "read us here at eleven she 's coming from the airport so whoever she was first so you might need to reel so Paul is like to come and join us probably know from rebus think the opportunity to present where red buses in support of the proposal for a lincoln lounge and a number of issues really one is that recommends are very high high volume area it 's arterial service so it 's three upwards of 3,000 passengers a day 400 bus movement so pretty significant for this for the city second largest operation in the city that 's a critical trent transport lee link between the west and east in the central city and we think it does it deserves for certain good facilities if you look at it by any standard it doesn 't really meet modern standards for an arterial public transport service interview there are a number of issues with respect to pedestrian access safety for passengers and you know just accessibility for buses and capacity for parking I guess it 's also going to be a stark contrast when the central city 's level of sophistication around that and you then go to record and we find very low level of service I think the city needs to take a generic view across its network and really put in place strong facilities there the other issue I think it 's really critical to notice it public transport actually enables growth and development across the city and lowers long-term loading roading demands which i think is something which is the council needs to take account of all I want to cover off sort of three must surround public transport now some of you heard the story of course I 'll be quick the first one is all about kind of people being that basically PT travelers are poor sods with no money the second myth is about you know all the people only older people and children travel and finally that passengers are retail a retail nuisance rather need to benefit this is a survey from a pre earthquake survey of Christchurch in 2007 and you can see across there that on the far right-hand side you 've got the percentage of people who far left and on the far right-hand side you 've got those who were in 50-plus so you can see that in fact that there 's a quite as strong usage of public transport people who have choices and and and public transport works well for them so I think it needs council support in terms of facilities around that matter from an AIDS perspective if you look at that graph the youngest that from 15 to 17 through to 16 on the right 16 plus on the right clearly there 's a reasonably even balance here there 's a bit of a lump around the younger people because that tends to be schoolchildren you know who don 't have other options in terms of transport so again it 's a very broad demographic being supported by public transport and sixty percent of the travelers are female by the way so it 's actually very strongly supported by the by the female gender in terms of retail there was a some work done prior to the earthquake in christchurch wellington and auckland by New Zealand Transport Agency and looking at and they looked at what they call sustainable travellers and those are cycles cyclist walkers or public transport users and they determined in Christ chips there there you are basically spending thirty five dollars per a trip on arterial service so which is a significant sum of money and what that accounts to if you look at it from from record in perspective it 's forty nine thousand dollars a day being spent by those travelers and 18 million dollars a year so not in substantial revenue that is coming from the travelers on public transport so just want to come those kind of mystery if i look at reckitt and lounge proposal the picture you have in front of you really is indicates similar sized city in Helsinki as Helsinki which is about 500,000 people we 've got a direct linkage between the infrastructure transport and the local mall now I know what 's being proposed here doesn 't quite go that far but we really want to encourage council to think about how to engage those so it 's the broad community it 's a normalized activity that second photograph here just showing the Civil waiting area so again you 've got Airport style lounge area with with great signage so just in terms of summarizing as passenger comforts important to challenge people to use public transport it 's all about safer unimproved pests pedestrian access supports the bus interchange development and the wider city recovery I believe no normalizes public transport you know it just makes it part of the normal community so that 's kind of about the lounge and the only other comment make is with respect to accessible City and the position of the cycleway on the north and side of chum street I really want to make it very clear that from redbus perspective I believe from go-busters perspective we understand the rationale for putting the cycle lane beside the interchange but we think there 's too much risk involved there at some stage there 'll be a cyclist who does something wrong and the driver will not see them and they 'll be a serious injury accident if not i did and i do not want air drivers to be exposed to place to put that cycle lane it 's just too risky and described as an unexploded hand hand grenade it will go off at some stage I 'm not wanting to catch you off but your time still growing short councillors may ask you some questions around there too Thank You fetishy that 's a second part which is another part of the transport infrastructure environment can be report so thank you and Chris cushions from you I 'm really glad you raised that because I 've rice that consumed as well okay have you looked at what happened in Wellington because it seemed to me that they used a lot of signalization they tried to mitigate pedestrians and buses but it hasn 't worked and I do you think we 're doing the same sort of engineering here that would I mean you 've said it 's going to be you know a risk but but Wellington 's probably the best example I can think of where there seems to be a lot of engineering to make things safe and you 'll be stall with accidents is it comparable what you do there are a small percentage of cyclists are small percentage will basically if they want to go some of the old go somewhere regardless of what 's in front of them if that happens alongside of us trying to turn left into them change and the bus driver for whatever doesn 't reason doesn 't see them there 'll be a serious collision and that 's a look I 'm not a betting press but I put money on that occurring I really don 't want air driver to be in a position with a either seriously injured or killed someone as a result of an oversight of something that someone else has done you know and with the best intentions in the world with the best engineering there 'll be those who circumvent it and we just we see that every day we cease like us to go through red lights who drive down payment pestering pavements on the wrong side and kind of expect to be seen so those things happen but there are very very small percentage of it of the cycle population you at 2am street would you would you prefer the north side of Turin street as a an option well it 's all in north side of the term street now you know that 's what 's being proposed so it sits right alongside than to change my pref it would be better on the south side from the point of view that you don 't have that clash position it 's really their clash where the buses turning something after i 'm strictly so edgy that 's that 's that that 's the clash that we 'd like to avoid at all costs because of the risk at some stage okay thank you he further questions okay Paul thank you very much for your some sure thank you but both those parts of air agenda thank you it 's time maybe three years yeah so _"

    "text": "is an item that i will move that that we adopt the resolution to exclude the public has set out on page 11 of the agenda and that Bob Lynam the CEOs ECHL be allowed to remain in the public excluded section of the meeting to provide specialist advice to the meeting seconded by Phil Clearwater is there any discussion Yanni I 'm thinking um I will not be butting for this to go into public excluded I think this council has been really good epping open and transparent around its financial engagement and I feel really said that at end of that process we are being asked to go into public excluded I have asked that the community sensitive bits of information contained within the report we 've put into a separate report that could be considered in public it 's wetter than the substance actually many of the things that have been openly discussed put in the public section but I feel really said today that we 're going to go into a major decision about our financial strategy going forward without the ability for the public to miss kind of got started but when the blueprint was announced in the cost year and the city plan one of the things that was raised by the minister earthquake recovery was that we were told it was pretty big wish list and it was now for the people of Christchurch to decide what the priorities were and I agree with that the people should have a right to know what our priorities are and how we deal with the financial situation we 're in so I won 't support this going into public excluded today this is for me about being accountable to our citizens it 's about being open and transparent which our core values which I stood on and I cannot prepare to sacrifice that for this report Ali thank you i just like to respond to that and say it 's been made perfectly clear to us why we are having to go into public excluded I 've received a number of emails from people who have expressed their disappointment express the same sort of things counselor your handsome has just expressed and when I 've excluded because of the conversations that we need to have a round of a net financial strategy I have had responses back from those people say thank you for explaining it we totally understand so I think we need to just get on with it this isn 't being done behind closed doors because we want to be secretive this is being done because of commercial sensitivity and for no other reason I 'd like to comment on this as well when we go into public excluded is to consider the parameters of our proposed financial strategy and we must have this debate and private and the reason that we have to have it in private as first of all the considerable commercial sensitivity around the matters that we need to be able to discuss see CHL holds our assets and comments we make could create commercial risk that they simply cannot control sitting there are assumptions contained within our proposed financial strategy that we cannot disclose in the public arena at this stage so they will be disclosed in the future the numbers that I 'm talking about will to the horizontal infrastructure spend and timing scope and ownership of the anchor projects all affect the numbers we are solving for these numbers may change between now and then the independent review of the horizontal infrastructure is soon to get underway and it will inform our discussions with the crown we will be explicit and the documentation that is debated at the end of februari and which will go out for public consultation and march so the reason for today 's debate to be conducted in private is so we can are searching questions of a commercial nature without any of the risks that public disclosure could entail and we can debate these issues without fear that we would jeopardize our position as an organization or any of our individual assets at the end of the meeting I will release the decision so people can consider the parameters that our proposed financial strategy will contain the full proposed financial strategy will not be released at this time it will be released at the same time as the consultation document on the LTP so I shall put the motion all 's carried and please record counselor yo Hansen 's boat against thank you the meeting will now be conducted _"

    "text": "gender is the establishment of a development authority and I will move the staff recommendation do I have a seconder seconded Jamie gough and I believe that we have some staff available to provide advice almost yes oh right Mike tilan and Peter guts all right there any questions that people have I 'm clean thank you you are supportive of this we need to do this I just need to reconcile in my own mind a key pardon just proposal and I 've had a good discussion with some about this in relation to procurement there just with the oag guidelines one part says even if the agent which this is proposed to be is from the private sector when acting for a public entity they must meet the same standards of good procurement practice that apply to the public ed so quite heavy to get behind this I 'm just I need some reassurance over how we can get this to meet up and I guess this comes down to proximity of this proposed entity from the main public body so if I could have a response on ohe guidelines are any entity that is fifty percent or more owned by a public entity will also have to abide by the office of the auditor general procurement guidelines so we don 't so if we 're going to have a private private sector entity obviously doesn 't have to abide by those and the definition in line between those is if it 's less than fifty percent ownership so that should clarify when it has to be when it has to follow normal guidelines so obviously the way it 's structured up p to it and it has governance ramifications as we know that what will be important will be the and architecture of a development authority as requested and aggrieved by councillors that will determine the form of that structure and also then the procurement model that would need to be followed thank you very much for the report and I just want to and and then the it 's very very specific and 72 about the areas that the future of ice we would be informed on one other area or one perhaps are no as how in fact would counsel have a mandate for what the authority would actually produce sentence of the projects how would we as council be able to do that I think that 's incumbent and I suppose the structure that you finally choose to set up to do that and depending again on the degree of ownership whether you do that by statement of intent to a ball or whether you do that by direct attendance on a board and that board member reporting back to Council I think those you 've got that choice to work through those parameters and clearly that 's an area that we will be reporting back to Council on but some options around that thank you Jimmy chin yeah and one questions I review the staff of the information 7.22 and compared to the 1 over 2 and also compared to the two on the four I will request the river CEO not provided urgent advice at the end of January last year but those items is kind of quite different I 'm not sure what 's the rationale which one is kind of 1.2 your particular men shoes are legal for mental function covenants of countability here is focus on the decision-making framework strategic direction or operation scope this is also different attempt I think I think that 's just a little bit of different language coming through obviously 7.2 other resolutions and I think it 's also noting that it 's not necessarily limited to that so I think while we were trying to earn 7.2 is reflect the key things that council want to have a look at where I think broadly we will be reporting back on all those matters that are canvassed at one point to as well thank you Oh Yanni um thank you I just wanted to check in with you over to before I know I have raised this with the chief executive and we 've had an email back around the idea that we first checked things by using private sector procurement and performance delivery approaches so just in a really simple way can you just tell me what the difference is between the private sector procurement this is what the public sector procurement would the two it 's probably easier to explain and the public sector requirements which is in the answer to cancer Livingstone guided by the OIG guidelines and in the guidelines been enacted at a policy level with the organization 's procurement policy the principles for public sector procurement and consistent across public entities in a base de Rio transparency finess to market and competitiveness and so forth private entities and while they may have some guidelines in policies and banned by the same oag guidelines this is still a second pad around with the performance how the performance story approaches tougher but just on this particular point why would we want to get away from being transparent having fairness to market and you know public accountability of public funding given that this is generally around public facilities I can see we want to get away from it I 've simply said that and private entity and may or may not choose to follow the OIG guidelines a public entity is required to follow the guidelines so then they 're not overly descriptive a property 2d can follow those xane guidelines exactly the same procurement approaches in terms of cuban policy as a public entity and that that is a choice and private entity would make so is that given that the assumption under 2.4 that the reason for this is to use private sector procurement and so some of us may feel concerned about that how can we more adequately address that before we agree to a principle can we agree to principle that should be set up with established with public procurement as being the key basis for I think that 's a that 's a choice for council but I think that would probably be premature for council because it 's not simply around the procurement obviously it 's around procurement as part of that I suppose that the value chain and there but equally things like being able to build strategic alliances being able to perhaps too the things through a variety of models under that framework whether that be Alliance models or jb models may all need to be considered as part of that so i think probably the answer to your question counselor hanson is probably needs to come in january and i think some of the advice that you 'll want to see coming back from staff other pros and cons around whatever procurement and legal structures put in place Ellie thank you 5.5 on page seven leading on 28 outlines the advantages and risks could you just a really simple easy to understand terms outline what in your opinion christchurch stands to lose if we don 't have a DA such as this that 's probably a quite quite a challenging question i think i mean summer speaks what this is around a few if you look at the genesis of this is around i suppose what we may lose is opportunity so really what when we look at if you look in section 2 which is what are the some of the challenges it 's the challenges that we face around actually getting getting the market moving and there are a number of both institutional and market barriers to getting the market moving there are those opportunities to do things that are outside the normal scope of what council may have done all about this is about trying to broaden the way in which we can receive and maximize opportunity in the market place and it 's around ensuring that we have very flexible structures to do that and speeding things up and then speed agility to respond to that is clearly one of those but it 's only one dimension in that equation thank you appalling I 've actually got two questions if I may for this to work I believe will have to be distance from accounts to a certain extent and independent and so will it then still be possible to have elected members on the board I think again that comes down to the choice that Council wishes to make I think if you look at the spectrum I think some of the advice is the more the more distinct this is as an organization provided it 's got a very clear direction from Council the more is able to operate perhaps in the way that Christians of agility and speed and opportunity are yeah I mean I think council will need to decide ultimately we 're it to know that we 're it chooses to sit in the governance spectrum will also influence what it can choose to do in the performance spectrum okay so that 's to be determined and regarding CDC I had a lot of questions from people how does this fit with the CDC a wider isn 't this sitting in CDC where their mandate is leading economic development for the city of christchurch so be quite good together an explanation around there so why we need something else and why they can 't sit in there well at the moment our current liver will serve as the CDC is largely it 's largely three photos largely around economic policy advice there is some work that they 've traditionally done this in the startup business area and historically they 'd used to do some work and some youth employment so again it would be a case of saying actually do you wish to change the mandate and the fundamental relationship you have with CDC again it 's a body that while it has its own border reports through see CHL again I think focused activity than what CDC currently provides us also think that again if depending on where this finally fall some of the models we 've seen around development agencies or authorities worldwide often operate with some additional regulatory authority or they have some bespoke Authority associated with them particularly where they 've had some state backing it 's not what 's being suggested here but that also suggests a measure of separation from general business of counsel is probably appropriate right okay that 's the thing that 's a thing I 'm Andrew I 'm given that a number of the questions this afternoon have related to the governance of the entity and also the mandate from council that it will work under and given that in 1.2 of the words governance and mandator mentioned I know that they 're not mentioned in 7.2 would it be an idea to put those two words in there so that we can be sure that the reporting back we 'll cover those areas that would be perfectly appropriate if you wish squared that is yeah if we could add that my way mandates yep into paragraph 7.2 please well as the mover I 'm happy with their so you can be with that councillor god yep I have a question which because in all of the discussions that we 've had about this that has occurred to me that perhaps we should also be reflecting on our own procurement practices I was surprised to find that two months was added to the process which was really a process to bring the decision back to Council and I wonder whether we should be thinking about streamlining that process at the same time yes Oh see how she like is it was easy girl so should we expect a report on there at the same time but we 've got we 've got the report in progress who are coming the new year on the delegations which will go some way to streamlining this the some all like by virtue of the legislation and there are some requirements that apply to cancel and executing the decision-making end user group we 're bound by lowes and that absolutely we should and can speed things up parallel process the two the two areas where the gut the governance sign-off fender and the procurement practice yep great good that would be a good thing excellent any other questions Yanni oh just wanted to check with the report that will come back are you going to do a kind of analysis of the current situation to get around you know having the most extraordinary powers by government that the government said would probably had a new zealand having their own development agency and having recovery strategies and an investment office and why that hasn 't worked I mean I 'm really keen to look at what we can do going forward but i also want to learn from given the situation we 're in where you know even going back to when the blueprint was announced that it was going to be up to the private sector to come along and fund these projects and they were mechanism set up that clearly haven 't worked things like the Metro sports stadium Convention Center we 're still kind of waiting and have been delayed not not through public procurement to have any sort of analysis of that in the report would comes back in January yes he says yes and info click flag to them the recommendation particularly taken into account the Crown 's current and planned activity in this area yeah it 's it 's an area and once you 've got to take that into account right okay and there has been some work done which has looked at the market performance around the recovery of christ church today so we 'll be looking at that material as well yeah I mean it was the whole assumption of the blueprint of how it would be fun it would be private sector and council but it hasn 't worked for whatever reason can we also get make sure when it comes back that we get information about you 've talked about funding implications but actually that the basis for the DA also seems about about maximizing councils return on investment so can you come back with some information about what percentage would be acceptable what the private costs are this is the public costs I think that 's a summation level because it will be dependent on the project and the objectives and the mandate that it 's given so funding overall is very much dependent if we look at the diagram that we have in the first diagram on 13 and we 're on that matrix Council wishes to position the development authority or special vehicles and that will determine the funding also determine based on the the objectives will they be social or economic and what the return would be expected for any particular part of that so it 's not one that we can at this stage commit to it 's already looking like a very large piece of work to bring this back in the end of junior but I just think it 's really sorry through the cheer really important that because my understanding previously is the reason that people hoping lighting up to fund stadiums is because actually the return on the stadium is pretty you know it 's not very good actually it loses a lot of money so why would the private sector be interested in building a stadium or mean I understand I mean that yeah can we get some information back on their cold the point the point that 's being made I think bo staff is that I mean I guess that 's the political debate and we can have that when we have the debate with staff I think they 're making it very clear they 're going to take into account Crown 's current and planned activity in this area that naturally looks at what 's been going on so I 'm sure that you 'll be satisfied with the report when it comes back so we 've heard what you 've had to say but I don 't think that there 's any point getting stuff to answer what is it basically a political question Pauline quick one regarding a report that comes back with it how will it be will there come back with different models or how will we or what we did as I know I read somewhere something bad a.m. we could develop more of a brochure focus model which could be quite attractive since you know your facilitator and will we see some modeled scenarios or understand I would hope that we would come back with a number of snows and maybe that those scenarios are not mutually exclusive I mean one of the things that council may do is actually take a fairly broad approach to this and and in some respects it does speak to counselor Hansen 's question that depending on the purpose of each individual engagement some of them may be commercial some of them may choose not to be commercial so again it 's it 's actually ultimately I think putting up a range of potential pieces to the jigsaw and say and she which of those do you wished actually doesn 't work you need a whole jigsaw actually putting of a number of building blocks and saying which of those do you wish to use or not use and I think that again that 'll be the debate that us counselors need to have around the table in January and if you get the architecture right you might be able to expand it after it 's already established or bringing through the alright so we 'll discuss the motion and debate motion does anyone want to Yanni thank you look I totally support the need for doing something different than what we currently have in the city at the moment if you go back to when the blueprint was set up one of the big questions we asked the government at the time was how is it going to be funded and we were weird reassured that it was all under control it would happen it would be sorted and when the blueprint was announced we were told that the big items like the convention center dimitrios sports in the stadium we worked out between the council and the private sector and it just hasn 't happened and it 's taken a huge amount of time and actually we 've seen very little progress so we have to do things differently and so I am happy to support the idea in principle that we look at how we can set up some sort of authority or vehicle to get things done in a different way because clearly the current system has failed this comes back for me the single most important thing is that openness and transparency is absolutely at the heart of how is set up and how is government and I don 't support getting rid of elected councillors when it comes to public funding being removed from the the ongoing looking at what this agency might do I think we should be really cautious about further putting things into the private sector because they know best when actually we can see as many risks in the private sector as we can see in terms of the council and I can just you know run you through some of those we used to we went out to a private public partnership or under a recycling plant and we got about two days notice with counselors that if we didn 't come in and bail it out we 're going to lose recycling in the city the risk always sets with the city and with the citizens that live in it and so we have to be really cautious about going into these public-private partnerships because we actually fundamentally always take history of private public partnerships and Christchurch to see where that occurs doesn 't mean we shouldn 't do things differently doesn 't mean we shouldn 't look at a new model to try and look at how things can happen and work together with private developers but we should always be really clear that the rate of return that we can get as a council is different to what a private sector might want and that 's why I think it 's really important when the report comes back we 're really clear about what costs we 're adding on to our ratepayers if we 're using a private sector model this is going through the public sector model so i will support one because I do support the idea that we need to do things differently in Christchurch but you know I do reserve the right to disagree with that once we get that information back through 7.2 but let 's get on do this work really look at what the options are with a really true picture of what the risks are rather than just an assumption the assumption that the private sector knows best and is less risky then what we might be able to do as a council so I welcome the looking at our procurement policy in parallel and if we can actually improve things on our end without the need for this then maybe that 's the way to go fell thank you um like yarny I I certainly also support the establishment of the development authority Authority and principal and I 'm very pleased we 've had opportunity to really flesh out the parts that are going to hell it 's all going to be how the architecture is going to be developed and because i think what all councils all together we what is that we want to have a commitment really from us as counsel so in fact the challenges that we have around the earthquake recovery that the projects can be fast-tracked so in fact their delivery can be accelerated I 've also got no doubt that the new development authority must be work on a as a collaborative relationship with council so that in fact we have the this is a really good opportunity for us as a council to address those challenges and the gaps in our recovery and it 's important though as a council that we do this all together so I would expect that in fact the you know the parts on governance and accountability that clearly they will line up there 's no doubt in my in my mind to though that so that the work that this development authority that it mustn 't be done at the expense of other council and community projects and alongside that though I think there 's great potential for example for some community facilities that that they 'd be that they be developed potentially through the development authority but this is a case to we I believe that community boards would need to be like the conduit worth the community so that in fact that again council has joined up with the new Authority so I think an example of that would be achieving the actual implementation of the suburban master plans that we have so overall I think this is a really good opportunity and You Jenny yeah I supported a star accommodation including this point one as well as 7.2 I 'm a bilingual the counselor the crisis if translate into the Chinese there 's a two words one is the risk the other one is opportunity wedgie which means after earthquake even with a vulnerable situation however give us you know is a ex ordinary the kind of opportunity this way we were important and also this opportunity another stay in there no remain in there they were away so we have two quarter this opportunity Austin the opportunities where we were with a important if we reveal the information no we still keep the current the kind of sector in a current of regulation probably a little bit difficult to play through and also we are all aware nationwide international of a potential that very good quality of investor will lie to protect of the repeal and a reconstruction of acai juice my personal reason they have a to the experienced one is the for mayor we are aware in a visible alki church they are all kind of 80 very important the wines lando they have population 4.4 meaning the people even equal to the New Zealand _"

    "text": "come number 19 thank you guys sorry generic guys item number 20 is the land use recovery plan the Riccarton racecourse champion male champion smile development mike is the truth Luke deserted you okay thank you um this has actually been through a committee his nose came through Yosemite entry so so the reason it 's here and here is that this came to the strategy and Finance Committee last week and the committee approved this but because that we have to send a signal to the government or to the ministry with a recovery by the food after the first of the simba that 's why it 's come alone to this council meeting for a consideration though and it went through was it strategy yeah yeah okay so moved Andrew seconded Jimmy you special I tend to hear particular emphasize the high quality safe accessible residential environment or chase tinabell context and also the item five affordable housing moments there are no I 'm not sure you a sprint that that 's correct I mean that hasn 't changed since the advice that we gave you last week I 'm there but there and which is why we 're not adopting this for giving it full approval as an exemplar we 're basically effectively sending the signal that in some areas they 're good and we prepared to look at them as an exemplar and some areas this opportunity for further dialogue it really places the ball back into night our who 's caught if they wish to continue to pursue this it sends a strong signal they 've got some continued work to do in this before council will consider it through the okay thank you this was moved Andrew seconded Jimmy sit right channel no it wasn 't oh I will I 'm happy to so yep okay jaani I just want to take you to the panel finding which is in summary the panel concluded that the submission sets out a development proposal which there 's the potential to deliver a positive evolution of traditional land subdivision have it at a detailed level the proposal was unable to present compelling practical evidence protecting in the detailed layout provided the aspects of the development including affordability accordance with the exemplar criteria and then it goes on to talk about why it doesn 't support it and then says it a more general level the penalty lighter that significant information gets left him struggling to make a leap of faith that particular elements would lead to love it given that that was the view of the panel why are you asking that we approve it a qualified approval given that it doesn 't seem to be much even except this is meeting the exemplar criteria well i think that the panel of the panel made its evaluation and we 've we 've made our evaluation and i think it was summed up by the mirrors the chair of the committee last week that this is really about actually continuing to recognize where people are doing some good things and encouraging them to do better there is no absolute in the exemplar process it 's going they 're going to be different than all those circumstances so i think on balance we felt that it was worth continuing to remain engaged with my tahoe to continue to foster response to councillor chains question it may come that they may choose to say actually we 're not Peter do anything more and it won 't proceed under the exemplar model and the report recognizes there are other options for them but I think as a committee will certainly a staff and then as the committee you felt that it was appropriate to continue to work with them towards that outcome I guess just supplementary like I 'm really struggling to understand i guess the purpose of exemplar projects that aren 't exemplar that are being asked to get qualified approval I don 't see what would be different and not approving it as a qualified approval for energy efficiency density locality and showcasing as to why they couldn 't continue working through trying to get me all of the exhibitor objectives but why do they need a qualified approval now as opposed to just going away and doing more work given that there is such a high degree of concern from the technical people well we 're here we 're required to give a response back to the minister so again it comes down to that that balance are we going to say we don 't believe we can say fully yes we believe that well we consider that on balance it 's better to continue to work with them to try and encourage them to get to that sin at that place but I would also comment that actually there is no perfect exemplar we don 't know the exemplar process is a learning process for everybody and not every exemplars going to look the same will meet the same outcomes so we 've got one model with sprayed and lodge we 're trying to work through and we 've had this discussion other models with housing New Zealand we 've got our own properties as well so each of them is going to look different and have a slightly different achieve different levels of outcome the whole reason we had the multi sort of the multi multi criteria analysis was we recognized not every every aspect of every development was going to be perfect so it is a bit of a learning exercise for us and the and that 's a learning as you go however there are definite criteria and some of the really really basic criteria around the exemplar projects involves affordability innovation and quality as well as some of the other issues that are raised in here and to be perfectly frank there 's nothing around those areas that seem stakes you took the boxes and when we read whilst tried and tested this model has struggled to manage how the types of home and living environments eventually created by third-party house builders not bound by exemplar requirements would deliver the overarching games around affordability innovation and the quality and there 's you know that those are the main things so look I totally understand what counselor Johansson is saying sorry my I do have a question my question is do you feel being so far from taking all those boxes at the moment there would be a chance to close the gap or I mean to me it just seems so huge at the moment the gap as you do you feel that that get could close and we could actually take some previously me this really place of the ball back into night are who 's caught if anyone is large enough and I suppose a significant enough developer to get across the line if they choose to it 's nighttime is there a willingness from the mall I think there 's been a willingness thus far and and perhaps this is part of the explain the continued exploratory program we have with them to see how far they are going to be willing I mean as I said this is not these are every one of these is a new learning curve for us and I suppose we 're trying to find the balance between actually saying yes we want to make some strategic gains vs. I suppose say actually no we very hard and fast eater criteria you don 't meet them we 're not here and the option for them is to as it succeeds in the report to simply go down and deliver a quote unquote bog-standard subdivision what they 've proposed here is far from a bog-standard subdivision what we 're trying to do is through this I ask a potentially mean question and you can rule me out and say that 's not fair Glenn if you want but I 'll try I 'll try it out I 'm what 's what I 'm thinking is do you think the bar is higher for say us as counseled to have to deliver on time and you know as you know we 've determined to do that I mean I see there 's a time constraint 19th to see em back but if this was us in that position would that the exit ramps right okay well that 's why I thought I 'd get it around okay don 't worry about it that 's yeah no that 's yeah okay yeah I 'm struggling with this one too I don 't think it can be called an exemplar and my question is really more what activities are they undertaking that are anything to do with exemplar can you nominate any apart from the stormwater swale um I mean everything that we see that they 've left out to me as part of us he only read community integration and in their ignoring the potential for a positive evolution which is what we 're really aiming for was exemplars to move forward in a different way so was that wanting to hold it up I don 't we can 't call it an exemplar don 't feel comfortable with it well I don 't think we are calling an exemplar at this point ok I think we 're sort of giving a poser a partial nod to the things they have done and invite your mod well it 's a qualified approval so it 's not an approval as an exemplar it 's saying that they are along the path they 're not necessarily there but equally as we know with the other eye other projects were in that as an evolutionary process in an iterative process in itself we believe this this continued meerut to keep working and to keep providing the opportunity for night our who to come and demonstrate what they can do in those spaces the other option witches councils at the moment is to say actually we don 't believe that they 't support qualification but i think the recommendation from staff to the committee and the committee 's recommendation to Council as we believe on balancers merit and continuing to engage with them I just say as I read it here is an area of land that has a could sustain a great deal of housing we either have a choice as I read this we either work with them to try to create an exemplar which creates a greater a good living environment or they can if they choose not become an exemplar and just apply through the normal RMA procedures to do a standard subdivision of those two I would prefer that we worked with any developer actually and to achieve really good community outcomes and I appreciate we 're not all of the way there but I 've I saw a pre working with the council proposal for a different area and then a post working with the council and the difference was actually very positive so in this case what I 'm expecting is that there will be a positive outcome to this engagement process with no that rather than just left him to go and subdivide yes but where do we sit on 6.2 then I mean the wording leaders does not fit oh so so we 're not there and so this is a first step and working with you to take the next steps as I read what you 're suggesting so I 'm in a sense I think we enter the debate part because people have asked the questions and I just want to explain why if the committee level I city supported this and when I think about why why it 's being done in terms of adding to the availability of housing which we all support it just seems n getting the best standards possible it seems sticking with this example of process is in everybody 's interest we 're not saying yeah yeah it 's good and there are some good features this concerns that the committee had to transport and access as well as one of them that they going to need to work on but even in that respect I I would hope that they can come up they 're going to need to achieve so end the rig the 62 is not agreeing to join in principle it 's qualified and I think that that tomb is quite significant so really what we 're saying is look and it 's actually summed up in paragraph 46 its weak in some areas but further work may you to have the potential for example other so it 's really my hydrogen counters not to put restraints on this process at this stage of the process but to continue to work with the process in to have night area that opportunity can you just go through an apologies if you see the semester but the knick so the next stages will we get to a point where a night ah who has to have ticked all the boxes for want of a better phrase and the callers made and it comes back to us could you just explain that please what we 're signaling is the opportunity for us and night are who to sit down and put them to develop this further so they really have I think probably yep we we 're prepared to continue to engage in that dialogue we want to continue to access the exemplar we 've seen the signal from the council and we 'll continue to work at some point would need to come back with a complete package and say actually this is what this is the best they 've come up with after all the style log and do we still support it yep yep the alternative for them is to say actually no we don 't think that that that 's we really want to engage in this and we 'll go back and we 'll just seek to use a normal art as as the deputy mirrors our line will seek to the user normal RMA provision and we 'll put down a subdivision I just would ask that these get put separate and just that you will put the 6.2 but I just want to make several points one is we 're not we 're not just about building lots of houses I think one of the really important things as we redevelop as a city is to that this doesn 't meet I would be you know more than happy to trade off the energy efficiency density and the locality for affordability diversity innovation livability in community so to me the the exemplar things that we should be trading off are not the ones that are being put up and I feel that you know this is really just an intensive use of land and on a record on race course site which has its own it I 'm special status and it just seems to me that this is the very thing we should be trying to avoid if if we want exemplar developments that build communities and build housing and if we want to help people fast track through the planning processes and want to put in place financial incentives then they have to be exemplar and I have to do a lot more than what 's been approved in 6.2 so I see no reason why we can 't continue to work with no tahoe and with the people that are putting this project up I think we should be really clear I mean the panel finding and I think the last thing we want is to encourage something like even if it 's qualified and in principle that actually doesn 't meet some of the core elements of what exemplar projects up so I can 't support 6.2 I think you know this was it this was done on the 8th of October so there 's been plenty of time for things to hear being done sentence and I 'm not prepared to take the leap of faith that we were that whipping asked to take so you know I I just urge that we think about I think this idea of approving things and principles quite dangerous it actually becomes incredibly hard to move back from things once you 've approved them in principle and I 'd rather have the search d before we agree to it so I can 't support this it does look like just a you know bog-standard subdivision and or intensification and I just think that you know the key aspects that we want are not here and we should actually not worry about missing the deadline over the place in terms of this recovery there are a number of deadlines that just won 't be met because of whatever circumstance I don 't think that 's a rationale for approving something and qualified principle to go forward happy to do what counselors ask can take it 6.2 separately can you just clarify for me the consequences of six point one three and four passing without 6.2 yeah as opposed 6.2 is around the signal that we 've seen back to the crown as part of our obligations under the loop where we required to report back on those example our projects so really effectively 66.2 basically I suppose in some respects sends two messages when it says two nite out who these are the areas where we think you 've first pass tick the box and as a consequence size of the other areas where you really need this and work on that it also says to the crown in terms of the holistic exemplar process going forward we think there 's still up a live project here for us to work on okay thank you go ahead with it as a standard subdivision well yes they they they could basic they could through the district pain review simply get a rezoning to probably living one and can I just clarify the point about community facilities within any subdivision I 'm assuming now that within any approval of any subdivision things like a coffee shop and those sorts of things that bring people together fairly standard what does that require the changes in the current district plan I don 't know so I 'm probably just extending beyond my sort of detailed knowledge of the plan provisions but in some respects it 's a question of scale and in terms of what the opportunities I think a certain either here it 's not the opportunities in editorial from silence and I try on comment emotion okay clin and then Andrew thank you i remember one of our team players involved a two-step pricey so i just wanted to check that in fact this is a kind of an iterative thing with this that it actually does come back to the council before we yes yes that to be done by approving the recommendations today we 're sending a signal to the developer that we believe that more work can be done if indeed they choose to do that for this to be considered as an exemplar so the qualified approval in principle is sending that signal to the developer today that some that we do want this to proceed to exemplar status if indeed that 's possible it may be it may not be but in in passing these recommendations today we recognize that we have a need for quality and quantity of housing to be delivered quickly the whole exemplar status would if it was achieved bring a good outcome for that site if it 's not achieved then we would be looking at a regular standard subdivision my belief is that the exemplar is what we should be working to and that 's the reason I 'll be supporting this today to give it the best possible chance of proceeding in that way thank you can I put in 6.1 6.3 and 6.4 and then i 'll put 6.2 separately okay yep yep if loop and they 'd be an l1 development see what you see oh well sorry I mean that that would be l1 is the sort of the general living zone it 's around it would probably be an LG under the new district plan but it was certainly allow well certainly provide for a lower level of density than that would be currently offering or proposing in this plan at the moment oh that 's my point that they 'd be reluctant to do that i would say they 'd prefer to do the higher density and by not pressuring pressing this point about the exemplar are we letting them off the hook a bit well I well I think we actually are actually doing the opposite we 're actually we are missing the exemplar we are actually encouraged in a state into the process and i would probably comment that in fact developers at gin early would prefer to do lower density the areas where they struggle the most is where they 're doing high density so anything that actually comes with a comprehensive view of higher density is 't Lex helpful thank you and so I 'm going to put it and I 'll put it in two parts okay so I 'm going to put 6-1 6-3 6-4 those in favor of those please say aye those opposed carried and then 62 which would need to go back into the same order that it was in and moved councillors turner in Clearwater can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed I declare it carried with pauline and Yanni voting against that right okay thank you and so the whole motion is carried _"

    "text": "item 16 psychoactive products Andrew your specialty social I move this to put it on the table yeah yeah would you like a movement and who else beside your hearings pin on oh oh thank you guys okay do you guys want to outline or do you want to outline anything and before we ask any questions or do you want to do that I can make some comments I chaired the hearings panel and I 'm certainly happy to make some comments on the report this was a particularly difficult set of deliberations the hearings panel in fact met three times in the end the the submissions that we we heard and the written submissions essentially fell into three categories people that didn 't want the sale of psychoactive products and in the suburbs or in some cases didn 't want the sale of psychoactive products at all people that didn 't want the sale of psychoactive products in the city center and some of those also were saying ideally they wouldn 't want sale of psychoactive products at all and then there was another smaller group of senators sell these things and of course they took a a more prisoner more business oriented approach wanting to be able to locate their businesses in areas where they felt either they would perform well or perhaps in some cases in areas where they 'd previously been been running so finding the balance between these was it was a real challenge and given the requirements of the the Act the purpose of the Act is that we must give a reasonable opportunity to retailers to to be able to retail those products to do that in the context of the submissions that we received certainly provokes a lot of thought and and we took quite a bit of advice over the three meetings and there was quite a lot of discussion and deliberation so we took the the preferred option which had come out of the the previous debates the council had had and looked at the central city rather than suburbs and within the central city area attempted to look at the parts of the central city which were most appropriate and perhaps not so appropriate so we 've got and we ended up with the schedule 1 map which was the broad area where the sale of psychoactive products would be allowed but then if you turn the sheet over we come to the map which has got the indicative sensitive sites on there and that 's obviously restricts the area quite a lot further and one of the things that we needed to take into account with this was the ability for the businesses to be able to establish in an area and of a size that was workable and at the same time bearing in mind the particular types of sensitive sites that we felt needed to be in there to protect the users of those sites and the activities that were happening on the site so we we did in fact add a number of sites to the the ones that have been noted in the preferred option they even River precinct on the basis that we felt that it was essentially a reserve behave like a reserve the bus interchange in bus super stops on the basis that people that are waiting there for public the activity didn 't sit well against an area where people needed to be and needed to wait the justice and emergency services precinct and health precinct similarly areas that people need to attend there 's not a lot of choice in needing to go to those places so again areas where large numbers of the general public including vulnerable members of general public would be and therefore areas that we felt needed to be protected as sensitive sites the Washington waste skate park obviously speaking to the fact that that 's younger people that use that and again it 's park and the Margaret my family playground for the same reasons so where we ended was on the the map that you see which has got the sensitive sites in there and we feel that we 've struck a reasonable balance between the issues raised in the original debate when we came up to the when we came up with the the preferred option what we heard through the submissions process from all parties and the need to give a a reasonable geographical area which is workable for the actually you in favor is attachment 1 or attachment 3 attachment 1 is kind of the in order permitted area but our test ministries are permitting area but specify the sensitive sites location so which one ever a point away is only attachment 1 so attachment 1 is the permitted area but then obviously there are the rules around the permit the sensitive sites so attachment 3 is an indicative map which shows how the permitted area responds to the sensitive sites so attachment 1 is the area but once you overlay the sensitive sites over there attachment 3 is those places where the activity could actually take place maybe step maybe staff would respond to that area is attachment one Jimmy but because of the sensitive sites which are part of the policy their area shrinks because of the look proximity to the sensitive sites it 's good attachment 11 is the part of policy attachment 3 is really just to illustrate what that looks like on the ground at the time the panel looked at at this and clearly some of those sensitive sites are static so the other ones like schools and preschools there might be new ones that set up later so that that we couldn 't put that map into the policy because it will change over time I just note the down the side that you 've got the various categories mental health etc etc I thought churches were part of that group and has that been factored into this downsize map at all I see Cathedral squares sort of pretty much the site and some of the old church sites that have have been demolished and maybe want to be rebuilt on are they they don 't appear to be factored into that map at all certainly certainly churches were not churches or places of worship were not identified as sensitive sites in the proposal the killer put out I 'm trying to think whether we had any submissions on it can actually remember but certain my understanding I thought they were they were classified no they were over the proposal okay one of the difficulties we always have around churches places of worship in these sorts of policies is that you get so it certainly wasn 't part of the proposal and it 's not part of what the panel is now proposing for May and there is still a state school to be still center of town is it possible that we could include any site designated to be the site of a school that will be built within the next ten years or two years to you sorry sorry is it possible to do that I 'm just aware that business is sitting up and then having to yep we 're asking we do try to allow for that I 'm just I think where it is in the policy okay so under on page 263 under sensitive sites II so it talks about theirs is that any sites at the time someone applies for a new license to set up a retail premises ok so if we 've been notified thank you thank you ahead and pick that up that 's excellent thank you and I noticed that the library is not regarded as sensitive either yep but i notice you considered it just just forgot it yep le I know that you talked about I think if I understood you correctly the difficulty and actually ascertaining what a place of worshippers would it not be fair to assume that one could reasonably expect a church to be a place of worship I mean why can 't we at least put things down that are currently used heirs and clearly used as a place of worship well again there are kept there are some procedural issues into some practical issues so in pratt and practical practical terms we will get into the issue of this church 's but as other types of religion that don 't have churches and we will get into we do get into that question of what exactly is a place of worship and how is that defined in terms of actually procedural issues that wasn 't part of the proposal and it probably would be a pretty significant change for the council to have added in either through the hearings panel process or at this point in time so we procedurally we can 't add that in now if you if you want to on a new SCP process a community centers sensitive sites not in the council 's proposal that we put out nor the policy that 's being proposed by the been being recommended by the panel okay I would have been inclined to put them on and then call the church or community center personally they moved and seconded can I put those clothes in favor please say aye those opposed what your vote recorded against Ali okay Ali 's vote recorded against and the motion is passed thank you guys that was a lot of work involved in

    "text": "who where we were just for lunch and we were on your committee Andrew which is thank you item 11 page 113 Andrew Turner moves and cigna bugging item one okay so this is the status update on the social housing rebuild and essentially receiving the information have we got staff for any questions on this great in 2.3 in 2.3 the accommodation type breakdown for 45 closed units include the red zone units we 've got the red zone broken out there in fact no that 's fine that 's that 's there where it needs to be less that 's all good the one thing that 's missing from this report is where there may have been some targets that have been set in the past and how we 're performing against those targets so once it 's encouraging to see this work going on and it 's good that we 're gaining some traction here it would be good to know what targets had been previously set or what targets we 're working against now so that we can measure our achievement against those targets and I in the past glenn may have some comment on this um from the work the previous housing committee had done but i 'm just keen to put the good work that we 're seeing here in the report in the context of what targeted and what we 're expecting to achieve over over period oh yeah if you in terms of a response to that so in next month 's report which you 'll hear next week the cheat committee there 's targets for the new build sides against what was agreed at the point of approving those new builds and and what we 're currently forecasting is completion dates with respect to the repairs program we had targets for the initial work package one that we reported against and that was for the last year 's calendar year for this year we hadn 't actually allocated hadn 't allocated targets to that because we hadn 't had a from our side we haven 't got a and approved we hadn 't had an approved strategy of what repairs we were doing so we 've only just recently got that the next month 's report they have has a has more detail around those closed unit repair side Ana so this will all be taken into account of in the report that 's coming to next week 's committee meeting yeah probably I 'm we will refine it on the closed unit or pier side in terms of time frames and that we 're getting greater detail around that side of it we have refined at next month 's report with respect to the new build side and that so we 've given you targets around that and how we 're performing on that so all right thing all right thank you very much thank you I 'm aware with our work streams those and affect the work packages free calendar you have infected or calendar financial year yep have actually in fact been out our targets as such but i think what Andrews asked opposed to just drill down my question is about once that the earthquake commission settlement comes through how all that change our ability to progress our closed unit repairs because every month we have the that 's head to be the joint assessment programs head to be suspended so once that settlement comes through can you describe how that actually changes the game for us yeah look I 'm probably the largest one it will have act around the delegation side at the moment as you currently aware we 're we 're looking at the last a delegation requires us to look at what the last assessment is by the insurer and what the current costs are to repair it or if it 's outside a limit then we 've got to bring a council report back to you folks which takes sort of a you know six to eight-week process so once we get that pay out of that global settlement we should hopefully be able to modify those delegations and that will actually help us speed up the process but currently at the moment where we 're still going full steam ahead and with respect to getting that you know the complete repair damage assessments done for those closed unit appears so there 's nothing slowing us down at all you know the 't break delegations you 've got to come back that entails the report system takes time but once we get that global settlement we can actually so we 're just waiting on eq c 2 and it 's yeah exactly and at that time we will you know we 're doing all the engineering work behind the scenes net to build those business cases up so nothing everything is progressing as fast as we can possibly progress it with the resources i got she had to pay she 's the first one I remember last time the in a committee meeting I emphasized that are you know the 3.1 and also the 4.1 this kind of the figurehead of the difference we got into each the stream extreme one on page 114 here the shutdown 's 127 over 205 close but on page 115 is 127 there 's a difference I just want to know when you will be the you know their to better clarify you 're correct already I 've corrected Adam in the report that you 'll see next month 's of I 've got those references right the table wine is correct also sleep on the wise correct I just want to become phone looks like four point where cross unit status des correct figure am i right the stream numbers sorry and in 4.1 direct our are incorrect if you look at the the first part the actual numbers of closed units so just to clarify and the and the partnership program the units that we 've identified we 've got 127 units closed units that we identified that we wanted to look at early replacement of those before the earthquakes yes the remainder of those closed units excluding the red zone ones makes up at to 205 number so those the ones that we 're looking at so and those numbers are correct in terms of you know in the partnership program we think there 's actually a we believe there 's eight units within that program that we consider our economic to appear yes and we 're actually going ahead with with four of those at boy cottages already and it 's the same with the 67 that we 've identified in there the actual stream numbers that we reference to didn 't align with the the work streams that we defined in section 3.1 okay thank your second question sir 3.23 regarding to fail packages I just want to know that XD one has been done already package 2 is the 61 the lumbers how about a three two packs of 5 do we have any the forecast or estimate how many for each of me we do behind the scenes and it 's basically subject to the the prioritization process and the asset strategies that are coming through from the housing unit so we 're working very closely with them and there 's a report coming through next month that will clarify that prioritization that you will decide on I 'm very similar to what you 've done for the community facilities by the end of june 2017 all them all the remaining of the 205 closed units everybody okay i have next journey I just wanted to check on the ones at night bridge lane what was the original timeframe for completion of those new unit builds so at Knightsbridge had said by jun 2014 we would have those units open their current forecast 8 is febri 2015 so what I 'm just trying to understand why the delay yep there 's a couple of things there it took us to be honest it took us three months to resolve the contract tags around around that that process and so we end up with a pure die due to the actual signing of the contract with fair one what 's the contractor is there any sort of lessons or anything that we can do to kind of learn from what 's happened I know we got for design and build so we 've already got a really quite short process around getting them done but you know I presume the ones I yes very much so and we 've actually incorporated those lessons learned into the subsequent ones on those those first two developments Morris Carter courts in Knightsbridge Lane we started off with a real blank canvas in terms of going out to those contractors and asking what they could do with configurations and layouts what we 've done and nailed down how we think the actual layouts of those should should look and how they fit into the the existing space met kind of stuff so really what we 're doing now is we 've got a slicker process in terms of going out to those contractors and they 're really putting forward a proposal based on an on layout that works and really looking at materials and sort of the internal designs of those units so it 's a much cut down scope yep could I just raise a point of order on that yeah that questions been asked several times a committee level okay point of process I mean that 's been raised civil is no need well some of my questions been asked but I guess what is if if in fact the tables we had were kind of like in one spreadsheet i think i would understand them better if it was a special in a three but what in terms of them adding up and I 'm no longer on on the committee as you know so it 's here that we see like the one of the main reasons you 're putting forward besides consultation with existing tenants and also that existing tenants need to be found other accommodation or they 've been fixed why in fact more haven 't_''_695.07 been fixed because given that some of some insurance money has already been received yep we 've looked the the short answer basically as the team has committed a huge amount of resource to working with eqc to actually quantify the claim over the current over the current year in fact since we started back in july of last year so that 's with taken resource off doing actual appears to quantify work through the whole portfolio whereas previous to that we were working through on a complex by complex basis and fixing as we win so you know that 's been one of the factors that contribute to that there 's been there 's resource shortages out there in terms of engineering a availability of engineering resources particularly when we 're looking at closed unit stuff with structural damage it all takes time really probably probably asking the wrong people we hoping for yeah okay can I come to pate and anything on pates any comments it 's not it 's moved by I cancels turning Turner in the turner in livingston um i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried that 's just receiving the report anyway Pat be holed up at be any discussion if not move the reporters a whole be adopted and that 's moved by Andrew and second it by clean but those in favor please say aye

development there or what sort of timelines are we expecting to work because I 'm very aware that delays over land acquisition will translate into delays to the whole project I 'll just ask Doug Adamson to respond and so it 's just going through that process and a parent or resolve the delay in the program that 's the last piece so when will they actually acquire the land in that process day yeah completely understand it yep so I acknowledged a series of people I 've forgotten you sorry yonni I 'm Jimmy with nicks wasn 't he yeah you 're you go yeah Ben Ali Linney Thank You even attend a very quickly the trusted request you know the wave is managed in a venue on their behalf I just want to know not to be clarified who only this pavilion facility who operate who is responsible for the maintenance operating costs say you Dave it 's least it 's leased to a couple of entities yeah not you yeah okay I 've got actually on enix Denali right um thank you I 'm just a question on that given that the pavilions now being used for commercial use is there a review of the fees and charges that we 're charging in terms of the lease when investor running it as a function centre could you get the answer back to Yanni that would be helpful we 've had some concerns about the answer the new Central Library as any counselors on that project control group and is it coming back to the appropriate committee or to our set of governance live all around the detailed design because my understand was there 's a few challenges in terms of what we 've got on budget what we so how are we engaged in that process the constant going out here for a design yes we are challenged i would say at this point the priestess anything I think us having some visibility would be really good and I was just going to say I think the performing arts precinct the feasibility study would be good for that to come to the kid committee or at least to some elect members I 'm not quite sure what 's happening with the pointy hats precinct well Ken the performing arts precinct feasibility study be circulated to us as elected members and can we get an update on what 's happening there as well what 's it for timing budget progress thank you thank you Kelly 's got the first I 'll come back you very much dear sorry smart choices we 've had over 400 responses to date online in written form and edited that with a verbal responses made at the 25 community events that elected members attended during that time and so they 'd started pulling together the information already and hope to have a report early I text you what Yanni was saying and I 'd be very keen to know that particularly with regards and the Performing Arts precinct with the key anchor tenant see that we still haven 't heard about which is a CSO and the court theatre it seems to be ongoing just a question around the Christchurch town hall and forgive me I should have found this out actually beforehand rather than asking it here but the question around how the Town Hall is to be repaired which but may not which but might or what have you because I know there are some options within the agreed cost year that we can go was how is the tender being developed and released based on the repair of what we had a person of interest getting the whole shebang Amelia just like a really are okay I must admit it does okay thank you issues also asked her can haul I star request for proposal or kind of scope of the work regard to the town hall this is repair tula auditorium James high for the room for you in the of me already second question regarding to the southwest area harbor because I emphasize many many times last time based on staff allroad explanation where you know the two presenter this the report of the site sigh direction to the communal bowl will be at the beginning of december but but I check the counselor the kind of meeting schedule will be held on second or December is there to or not if that is possible in a supplementary question it 's possible next on can follow some other project have a kind of two after roughly the time CEO give us that picture as repeated for many times your neighbor pull in here with regard to committee facilities rebuild the guard evil Mona Vale homestead Turkey and wealth and polite argue would be repairs so these significant community facilities I 'd argue that the stone our craft old stone house would be in this lot as well and I 'm just wondering I 'm sure Phillip are in the same mind here well can we get an update of where this is because if you 're quite frank I get some firm action on this very quickly the all of those are covered off in the Heritage monthly update that comes by the cheap committee so I think next week the meeting you 'll see an update on all of the Heritage Program come through for the purposes of this discussion I got given a number of topical items to respond to and for some reason that wasn 't one of the ones that came through this report but I will be covered as I say next week at the cheat committee but could weaken sure that this is on this list from now on is that it 's okay but I do want to make clear that as a council websites wanted to build up community partnerships at cetera the old stone house is actually a really good example of this which as the community has an involvement with the Botanic Gardens green spaces it 's the facility for weddings and earns money and it is in danger for these groups that use it are starting to fall over this is a crucial and key community facility and it messy and expert report continues in this format play clock will be you know and I do want some firm dates on though I know that 's hard but we 've been waiting long enough I think it 's funded and it 's in our priority one so you 'll see all wet stuff thank you just see each we 're master plan no update available this month he wasn 't one last night is there um any progress now I know that the Grasmere cycleway as as part of that project and that is progressing but is there anything else planned and part of that or or could we perhaps just say for the next month 's report can we please have an update then it would be really know what 'll be right next not the next CEO report there 's a lot of you each other like any Bibble bein up there yeah I 've also got another one just on on the next page 80 if I may okay um could we have a nut update of both pseudonym and the cell and street shops a developer and council staff which girls are sellin street shops nothing is hip and so lets you lock an update from staff with regards to sell and answer them thank you um I just look at the heritage buildings at sign atop a page might avail and I just I just raised the question I 'm really concerned that the son of the target a is still in the consenting phase when we probably approve funding for that almost a year and a half maybe two years ago so something doesn 't sit right with me is it possible to just I know this has come up that the tube committee hears it possibly get an understanding around in terms of what we 're doing around consenting and whether we can in relation to those priority heritage projects that you 've talked about the contracts are all in place we 've got contractors mobilized an on-site now at goethe hall and we 're anticipating next week they 'll be on site doing mona vale side of the target hey etc so yet but has taken a while longer than to the heritage buildings require us to take a bit more time and a bit more partnering with their consenting friends on level 3 but again you 'll get a bit more of an update the primary the primary target for reporting progress on those via cheat committee so there 'll be a full update on all of those projects who at nick 's thursday afternoon as well i 'm expecting the contractors on site next week yeah assume that kind of request for the urban regeneration maybe just have a little bit more detailed reporting particularly things like the coastal pathway where things are happening and in fury road and I just you want to go there okay um in just one question i had on 70 set such as part of this kind of facilities rebuild not prudent yeah it 's part of that 's part of that whole report then up to know why i know that the consultation finishes on the tenth of december so it sees a special consultant procedures being undertaken what we completed in testing the 2014 I just wanted as any way of the year what 's wrong yeah and I volunteered to go on it but the thing is um yeah okay so if there 's no way it can happen that 's that 's that 's a shame but okay right ah what made you want falling he denies agent a little bit Gary YAGP okay right thank you just if I could please have a date for report on the expressions of interest over the new bride and legacy project if we get a punk I mean okay thank you hey JT now man 2 i 'm not going back just kidding the high street I 'm implementation at the top of the page and this is not our thing but I 'm wondering what 's happening with the shops north up to the south of chum all that he really that still reads own year so we able to get some sort of a request an update from no back here towards politic yeah because their whole it 's still reads owned and at some that 's going to hold the whole area Becker so is it possible include on this report each month those shops and the pile of rubble in Colombo Sri forget I 'm a must say I probably get more complexity that then yeah the moment end of you if you have an office on Center Street to the rear of those shops and you have to look at the back of their everyday and I know people in there that are just absolutely tired of it it 's a huge I sorts message I totally totally agree and it 's lighter than anything while it 's building and the wall and but let 's give an update if we can carry on those two sites thank you yep no problem I 'm on page ad a you yeah um yeah I also was going to ask but we have actually had resolutions to try and work with Sarah and invite ministers to come and discuss it because the designated site so yeah we need to do kind of get some resolution um accessible City are just the bus interchange we are we going to get a report back on that at some stage coming we will need it everything yeah I 've heard that down okay right thanks turn on 80 in the public realm network plane so the project team is under kate taking the stakeholder engagement process do we have a list of who the stakeholders are we can get you there we don 't have it with us there was it not is it not the full public is it not everybody or consultations have dealt think with some of the key landowners in the area and obviously they 're talking to counsel but I 'll come back to you with a full list I think it needs to be noted that this uses the word engagement rather than consultation and they are different things aren 't they would that be for you to say yes and that 's not a bit intentionally mean to be anything other than stakeholders general an engagement general but we can get that information to you about what they 're actually doing and so how long is that engagement process can we get there to swell please okay thank you thank you everyone um reply about how what we 're doing to mitigate waste water overflows boo end because I haven 't really been able to ascertain its outside councils counselors jurisdiction my questions in relation to the letter up the laterals on private property that adjoin the work for example that skirted doing and fixing the main points so it 's really can given the impact of those laterals can we ascertain counsel from eq see what their processes are in relation to fixing broken wastewater literals is particularly when skirt have repaired Street waste water pipes oh then it 's not I don 't expect you to answer some of that oh sorry TC is responsible for earthquake damaged naturals up to 60 meters from the house and I understand that they had an agreement developed so that as the main sewers relaid they would realign the laterals that worth quake-damaged currently they 've got about 1,200 claims that they 're working through the Kendra Kendra home repair programs and looking at another 900 but they respond to claims so if householders feel they 've got a problem from earthquake damaged laterals DVD and then if you see we 'll look at that but they 'll reimburse the cost about if it 's earthquake-damaged course the other causes of damage tree roots and those sorts of things wouldn 't be covered by then it significant I wonder people know that I think that I 'm right I don 't think they do I think that for what it like what my other question will be on it we went to us now is how many properties private properties have no EQC fixed they let the literals on and I 'm aware there 's a lot of claims in but and I think that people aren 't aware the process thanks for explaining the DVD process at some level earlier on the earthquake after after the earthquakes people where we 're there but the whole of work I think probably does need to be done but it certainly needs clarification obvious then that there 's a lot of people that still don 't know so there needs to be some sort of a publicity about the secondly of people they have to pay hundred and fifty dollars eqc will reimburse if it 's proven to be earthquake now because of the length of time often you can have tree roots already in there from the earthquake damage and it could be interpreted that the tree roots caused the damage not the earthquake so we 're into that zone but the fact that people have to stump up that four hundred odd dollars is a bit of a barrier for people getting it done and as Phil see that 's actually negatively impacting on our own counsel stormwater because it allows the silk to come in so it 's a very serious issue and I know couple of people that have just had it done this week so how many people are out there that heaven Headley laterals and speak to and I think it 's something we need to do an action bring an action on some how can I suggest it I actually talked to eq c and to talk about what the process might be for advising and informing people of a sort of option I 've just had a quick a variable update from the conversation that I heard ok coming in and um it also be really good to clarify because when we got ours done it had to be an approved drain layer by eq c so it 's not just your trailer so if we could get clarification on that because that as a it 's a very long process because they take the DVD then they send it to wellington for someone and wellington to have a look at it if c ridiculous said plainly as a drain layer you know like so but anyway but i just if we could clarify that it has to be an eq c approved drain laying company that does the video because that 's my understand that was what we were told and we had a short list of who we could use to formally respond to some of these because i 'm aware that we are live streamed and if people were listening to this and going to get the drain layer and suddenly find out that the drainer is not eqc on the Olustee whatever then I 's no use to Carlene as well when she does raise us one of them if they want to prioritize we 've got two cases recently where a driveway has been repaired over the access point to the laterals so there I mean that might be exceptional somehow I doubt it but there are people who are undergoing repairs on driveways at them moment which will mean once they 've done the access to the laterals may not be quite as simple and they might be able to do them both at the same time thank you yeah I 'm two questions on this page 83 poor arc I 'm just really possible whether we 're going to get a report to come to the committee or to council to approve going out for an eoi and what we 're actually asking for in the ER eyes I 'm also puzzled as to we haven 't figured out what 's having with the red zone this is in the middle of the red zone adjacent to it and we 're going out for EO eyes now for what can happen to look look at in the red zone so um can you just pour it park yeah I mean I think it 's great what people offering to do there but I am worried that it doesn 't seem to be a kind of bigger picture strategy around the red zone well I don 't know what the flooding or the storm water or whatever I don 't know any of the impacts at the writing I think so and I think it should be there should be a process that the council actually signs off on going out for a Oh eyes or rhps for areas any number three and also just to say hey Glee 40 min community where we 've got quite a big interest given it 's right on the boundary of our ward so any development there 's likely to have an impact and yet we 've had almost no information on this at all and in three I just get so you want a report on purrit park or we designed you know well I just want to understand the sequencing because I support it relates to the widest reach agent look at the root zone in number three just the dust monitoring in ballston I was really hoping we get a bit more of a report on on this so just understanding what 's happening I see what the dust it 's all about land managers but I kind of wonder from an enforcement point of view whether we 've got in terms of land use consenting what role we 've got in terms of counsel I am really concerned to see that that 's an initially then walks done where the dusters actually the air quality is really poor and i want to know what we 're actually doing to really control that as best we can just briefly that the there 's a joined-up group are the different agencies involved who report to to the infrastructure environment transport committee report really it 's its quarterly and they 've previously given really good information there 's a specific areas you know certainly people might want to ask that well i think that isn 't the committee say as an appropriate vehicle to areas okay thank you for Flynn think if i may just very quickly to the hard part i speak there when it came to the board we in discussion tried to determine obviously by a way of lease how risk works it seems to me it would transfer to anyone developing their but we need to just clearly ascertain me well i think just to support you only on this it would be the responsible thing to do that keep all that info on the land it 's it 's bad late but we do need the data and I think it 's responsible thing to do before actually going down the path of an eoi it does thing we 've got a problem and send all burns around Stapleton 's road and it 's the Worthington 's contract so if I could perhaps request that the cheer our requests of information on there and I note to the enforcement 's it 's really difficult because the part of the consents means that they have to damp down the rubber when they 're dealing with it and it 's really sure that they are complying that it 's interesting that weekend both of the year ear monitoring their detectors for the clean air quality ones and walston in one sense and Albans and both of those are we we have a very high dust problem as well so I just need to point that out that I 'm wondering how I 'm reflective of the data it is citywide perhaps or is it thank you right I 'm now on ice enemies _"

paragraph 4.6 on page 151 the estuary edge master plan is referred to as currently on hold can I just get some information please on where that 's at at the moment and its relationship with what we 're looking at today are so this the eastridge master clean is something that sets with the chief operating officers and group in in anticipation of that question I have raised earth Chris Gregory about the desire to reactivate that and so the only information that I can provide you right now is that that we have raised that they need to reactivate bit and into start and the work program i think it 's julie enters they tick not that in the new year again right okay so apologies for that but there 's a step on it yeah um one slight a minute to 6.4 which hasn 't come through which was so that 's paid to 152 and it was the keyrings pedal notes the various concerns raised about the concept design for the reckless village centre roading design in relation to minimum what standards and lots of car parking the hearings bernard such recommends at this urgent public consultation on the detail detail design suppose or this area of the plan that incorporates the skirt works in the main road proposal um so that was that was a recommendation from the hearings panel it 's a line to 6.4 I mean I 'm happy just yes yeah so it 's it 's basically just giving a little bit more clarity so cool so it 's not fundamentally different I mean it could just be reduced can you give the wording and a format to people who can do something with it so we can all at the bottom about the Easter each master plan being reactivated in january three i know it since 6.33 but because we 've gone one step further than advocating for it now does actually signaled that it is going to be reactivated would it be whispering a note as is that okay to do with hearings panel recommendations or no just adding a note a note from cancel I i believe i believe i 'm looking at our procedural people but i believe that that it would be ok because counselor considering the recommendations from the hearings panel yeah okay fine yep then if you can do that Phil Thank You Carolyn and others I 'm with 6.4 I just my understanding there is that the reason that there 's the further further public consultation screens is particularly because some detailed design work is required for the whole plan and on understanding the reporters act in relation safety where cars might park is that what we 're talking about the in terms of the reasons for further consultation it may be because the recommendation has come from the hearings panel the hearing and that that 's so the that 's the reason though for the further consultation that some detailed design with is required in the main document and the mask and opera what it said was that it were opportunities for the community to be consulted edit as this was a high level concept and it 's the detailed design to be able to use for public to engage in that process so it 's really just given that this was the person virtual road with the two areas of contention and there 's a process underway the result of each will Road area this was the other one that people felt it was important to signal that we do expect the detail design to go public consultation okay okay so we now have in front of us yannis amendment which who else was on this hearing panel Syria temple son I can 't end Ottoman not here ok so we 've noted that and you want to note as well and Pauline that the council notes that work on the history edge is master plan is okay so read like that the council notes that they work on the history edge master plan but okay new calendar yeah right okay so moved Yanni and seconded Pauline okay how can you further debate it 's not speak sir yep you may yeah okay thank you um Thank You counselors that this has been almost three and a half years in the making and so you know it 's pretty momentous occasion the the reason that council supported having a master plan for this area and this it was actually started prior to the coastal pathway was that we recognized the amount of huge amount of capital expenditure through both the repairs and the renewals that we currently hit on budget prior to the earthquake so there 's a real opportunity to take a coordinated approach across this corridor it is slightly unusual in terms of master plans and that most master plans were focused on very specific suburban centers this one actually looked at the whole corridor because it was felt that this was a real area of opportunity so there 's a number of changes in red that in detail through 17 pages 17 12 174 so you can see where we 've just tried to get a little bit more certainty into the master plan given that it has taken away while and given that skirt are doing things in this area just trying to up a lot of us as just about updating current information than putting it into the master plan so yeah thank you to the staff who have worked on it Mike Rushworth is actually no longer with counsel but we do appreciate that he did spend a considerable time working on this so we acknowledge his work and of course acknowledge the community for their participation in this process I have to say we had hearings which was unusual this was the first annal to actually have hearings as well in terms of our master plans and that was actually a really good beautiful process so I 'm just for going for just a slight reflection but essed year I thought having hearings into this was really good and it really enabled us to kind of tease out a few ideas with 't go through any of the other changes just to say I think we 've come up with a good balance there 's a little bit more work to be done that we really can to get on and get us in place thank you and says they narrow our before you okay moved and seconded I 'll put those those in favor please say aye those opposed to carried thank you very much indeed right go _"

    "text": "Kevin Lynch on behalf of the Christchurch Speedway Association just be aware of the ten minutes because it does include questions thank you and the the name skelter and um a company here by a John Mitchell who 's the the club 's children hmm and I have and I hope it 's been circulated and provided just a brief summary of where the speedway has reached all the position that 's reached in terms of we 're PC 52 has gotten to and what it sees as the more sensible approach from this point on and in the circumstances of what has has transpired in terms of attempts to resolve the appeals on pc 50 to the speedway finds itself in a position where it does support the the car clubs request to withdraw the plan change in favor of inserting new provisions by way of face to the christchurch replacement plan process and as i know they 're the main reasons for this position are but the financial costs to the club to the association of continuing and the Environment Court prices it 's been a very costly self-sustaining and on a fairly limited budget in terms of what it does also the uncertainty of the outcome of the Environment Court and in particular the uncertainty and the costs associated further costs associated with the use of a section 293 process which of is to deal with matters that are beyond the scope of either appeal and wood as missoula noted probably resolved and further public notification of those provisions only and the outcome of their of course is still up in the air and then time and finances are going to be and taken in that process is wrong and also the ability to actually submit to the Hearing Panel on the replacement district plan and on the new set of rules that would be presumably still based on the matters that we 're advanced at the mediation that to the speedway is actually quite important because there 's I know later on and the speedway didn 't actually submit on PC 52a an instance which it is was instantly regretful about when PC 52 s decision by the Commissioner came out this was an oversight it rail it worked quite closely with council staff in terms of establishing what was going to be in pc 52 and whether or not it could actually live within those limits and essentially it could and i think one thing that has to be said is the the speedway is is a i won 't say a bit player but a smaller participant in the entire process then either the cacti ball quite a plays in terms of its its role has been limited in terms of what it 's trying to protect has been quite limited but at the same time it 's been absolutely essential for it to be part of it because as was also mentioned one of those provisions that was included was the the so-called same day rule which would have meant that on any weekend day that the car club was operating the speedway would have been left out in the cold and would not have been able to operate at all which would have essentially have have ended the speedway 's their existence a true Epona and of course the speedway has been over 55 years now and it 's it 's a a proud we organization that has produced three world champions and i think john probably knows the ball it 's intercept that was it bonny beard the club 's actually produced three wheel champions that was Ronnie Moore was first it was Barry Berg 's an Ivan major came from the Christchurch bigger association as well and we 've also seen younger people across to England who can race in the National League and make it their living so there 's been a lot of come out of the Christchurch Speedway and we also train younger children from down from around about twelve upwards with small quarter midgets and they progress through so as a sporting complex as well as an entertainment venue we make their money out of the entertainment side which is Saturday night and with that money we continue operating I guess the short window is that the the speedway itself resident now represent does represent a significant financial and historical investment a true Epona and its current lease for the site actually expires in two thousand reasons from being involved in pc 52 we 're pretty existential in terms of where things have gotten too and i don 't think i need to dwell too much on the process that 's gone to date but i will kind on the fact that throughout the process of trying to resolve the appeals they have been improvements made and i think for the from the speedway 's point of view its ability to make significant improvements certainly in terms of reducing hours anything has been limited but it has in fact changed its hours of operation so it was able to finish slightly earlier starting slightly earlier as well it 's made changes to things like its public address system which was noted as a point of annoyance and it has actively participated and we can group processes which heaven crow included the the residents and have been something that they want to continue with i guess there to sum up and we won 't waste any more of your time but the options that the speedway seats for the council are basically to proceed to to try significant flaws through a process that has already consumed significant amounts of the speedway 's limited funds and others funds obviously and will inevitably consume more in terms of Appeals which are yet to be determined the other option is to start again in an informed way based on the outcomes of the mediation that we 're agreed including by the council work and include a workable rules package in phase two of the replacement district russia sister plan and the final comment we made there which may preme some of the questions is that the basis for the speed were supported the second option is as reflective in part at least of the fair that is not confident that the parties can in fact achieve an agreed outcome at the Environment Court thank you just just just to clarify apart from the differences between the track and the style of vehicles speedo is predominantly races at night so that when you 're explaining about the double day you would have a ruiner course race during the day and that evening so so people coming out that have a full real poorna during the day and speedway at night but predominantly your events is in race events are in evenings they 're all excuse me they 're all in the evenings and yes I wouldn 't go so that the way the rule was actually formulated it didn 't require a race meeting at her opponent Raceway for the speedway to be left out in the cold it could be any motorized activity on Rue Epona Raceway itself would have meant that the speedway wasn 't able to operate on that day to be fair I I do have to be open about the fact that that it is one of the areas that the residents were willing to to to move on and so that there were solutions that we looked at at that particular issue so in a little venice it may not have been the thing that broke the camel 's back and at the end of the day but it was a significant issue and i think it 's one that because of where we 've reached and the fact that mediation what the success at _''_485.81 on the table and it would have to be dealt with through the court process as well though the tuning of vehicles and for leading into the i guess thank you and your claim that plan change 52 has got significant flaws particularly in relation to point three on the handout that we 've got here plan change 52 contained definitions that would have captured everyday activities that are essential to its operation can you give us some examples of those everyday activities the principal example was the definition for motorized activities which would actually have captured things like lawn mowing and delivery trucks and things which which would have actually meant that a day which the car club was allowed under the plane could in fact have been lost by negligible activity at the time we 're to be just a little bit of detail the under PC 52 the car club I mean story the speedway has 15 race events per year and five practice of medicine and there were some other days there which the purpose of which we weren 't really quite sure they came through particularly the motorized activity risk to the fact that some of those of in days couldn 't that have been lost to two things that were not in any way associated with an event okay thank you Christian was about the Guru opponent knows logger just do you guys use there as well just we our events are also recorded by the noise logger ok and so how many the breaches of your head and how many complaints of your head well we 've had no complaints and we haven 't been over the 95 dbas get the boundary thank you okay um given I 'd be interesting just understanding how you compare to other speedways around New Zealand and why you think that the Environment Court would lead to uncertainty as opposed to the uncertainty of a new hearing panel and a new process being started that might actually come in with a more extreme limitation on what you can do so we got you were here you saw the information we got would be good just to get a view on how you compare the rest of New with a new hearings panel we I count listen Springs out of it it 's a very unique track it 's once again it 's totally owned by the council it 's Nick 's of the zoo and it 's a different story all together there is the tracks around New Zealand a pretty much the way we operate and if you take it down and time we start our first race at six-thirty it 's all over at ten thirteen times a year and unmet we 've got five practices so you take it over year the place is hardly used in pretty well much the speedway 's rights are you doing the same they all run about fifteen events per year and that 's to do because tracks wheel and deal with one another I suppose you could say we use their competitors they use ours and it 's 26 of them all operate on a set day night so it gets quite complicated just addressing the point on uncertainty though I think the uncertainty is an uncertainty as to the length of prices as to the outcomes fatal to to the speedway and terms of through the Environment Court we just it is speculation though and we don 't know and the position that it came to and mediation and because that has been treated as a package result at the moment it does provide a degree of uncertainty which we think is less likely based on the information that the council now has an from being a party to these to these proceedings and what its in its understanding of the actual operations of our opponent and the speedway now which I think are actually much better than they were thank you any member of the public you guys have a meeting upstairs just 14 minutes so I 'm going to suggest that we adjourn for 20 minutes and return here actually 11 that 's okay it 's a long 20mins _"

    "text": "deputation is Georgina and Georgina Hamilton Amanda juror from laney porky welcome and I think you probably understand the rules um wait 10 minutes and we 're in your hands so just waiting for the PowerPoint presentation to go up on the screen okay you should have a copy of our powerpoint presentation in front of you as well I apologize for the single site that was a slight of my hand on the photocopier the spawning and so starting i 'm here with Keith Cowen who is a car club member and a past president and we will be presenting to you this morning okay um motor racing circuit a true Epona has been serving the community for over 50 years since 1991 23 years ago it had the addition of the volume that was actually being processed through the wiggle room air field circuit as well so it had activity added to it at that point the raceway is not as a raceway plus you will hear in the next presentation that it also includes a speedway so there 's a speedway and a Raceway side-by-side comparing to on council land council own land it 's managed for the city by the car club and should the car club be unable to manage the raceway events the the property and the raceway reverts to the council motorsport is a key part of every community and over the 50 last 50 years it has grown it 's sort of like ballet or cricket or rugby it 's got a loyal and growing attraction internationally and the car club professionally manages the 80-plus organizations who use the raceway the raceway also proved plays a huge role and community safety and that includes city council staff learning driving schools police fire brigade truck drivers etc the raceway asset is entirely self-funded it receives no community or council grants its replacement cost is over 20 million dollars and surrounding the raceway is a very strong business community supporting motor racing activities then activity brings in over 25 million of economic benefit to Christchurch City without the Raceway places for drifting burnouts and racing will be back on the streets of Christchurch and rua pune has been there as a circuit for since been consistent development at the circuit over that period and probably more since Wigram airfield circuit closed and the club has managed the raceway probably better in the last 25 years than it did in the first 25 years where it was absolute open slather out there anybody could go out at any time in terms of economic benefit the column on the right has been the figures have been put together based around if I am motorsport New Zealand calculations together with a formula that I understand was acceptable to the City Council about two years ago on the other side it is contra car club research and in terms of the National racing support that 's Christchurch competitors competing nationally international crisis competitors competing internationally a car restorations we have a number of restoration businesses here earning a lot of money from restoring racing cars for international clients and there 's a lot of engine developments going on with places like Calvin linked in terms of safety training we run a number of safety programs out there and we 've got Dan the mightest motorcycle man and Darnell out there last week we also had Nigel letter out filming a video for kids in terms of driver safety real pune is a city asset totally financed by its users it 's a responsible City citizen when the city was looking for somewhere to put Street kids that would were doing burnouts a burnout pad was put a true Epona when the city was looking at the problems of drifting the car club introduced drifting as a faction of the sport out a true at pune so we have been responsible and trying to assist the city as as it 's a community facility we have not just motor racing out at real pune as well and it 's just a snapshot of some of the clubs that are involved in the air and on the media front you can read the press every week and see the dozens of items on on canterbury car race drivers who have done their initiation at real printer and an enjoying international success motorsport does keep crisis on the international media map and it 's enjoyed by families and youngsters and all world come over the last 12 months we 've worked to put a very comprehensive noise management plan and place which series of fact it wasn 't there that is via now we have made excellent progress Andrew a pruner probably today is more important than it ever was 50 years ago just in terms of that there is a new noise management culture out there every user of the park is well aware of their requirements in terms of noise you can 't help but notice that as you come in the gate at the noise logger on the boundary which has been there since february2014 reports the facts rather than people 's view of what 's happening out there and we have our own noise laga that we 've invested and out there to help us identify offenders noise offenders there 's very strict penalties for noise there 's an open line for residents and in the last 12 months we 've had only three complaints of noise to the car club I 'm not sure how many the City Council staff ever had we also have a is very accessible for trying to meet moderate noise at the park in the next slide shows an aerial photo with the contours that are wrapped round row Epona the blue is the 65 the rear is the 55 in the the light blend that all shows the boundary of that zone despite what Sarah said to this before there is the skull is not on the 65-year you can see that there 's no it 's mostly rural areas and you can see the few houses that the council purchased and within the 65 and there is only one house there that is not owned by the council and that 's owned by housing New Zealand they haven 't been involved in this process and have not complained and you can also see that it is well positioned to the left of the of there you can see the old templeton hospital which is now to design for a sort of a hi-tech industrial zone and then of course the prison to the top of it and they don 't tend to complain in terms of the plan change during that process it supported it through the process and it relied on the council noise data and assessments the council 's decision very commissioner imposed some additional constraints and I note that the weekday activity was not questioned or further constrained the additional constraints were unworkable for the car club and the speedway it effectively meant the speedway couldn 't operate anymore because of that what was called a double day event and so the car club felt that had to appealed and it peeled in a way that included the speedway which of course as you 've heard was not what we will hear it was not a submitter so and the car clubs appeal we added the issue that the speedway had to enable them to be involved in this process as well and the car club mediated in good faith they attended six days of mediations with experts and lawyers they attended on their own seven working group sessions with your acoustic engineer during that time period of noise laga was installed by the council and at that stage it was found on that analysis that standards on PC 52 in the advice for the car club by its acoustic engineer was that would mean an additional day of activity during the week would be lost this matter was immediately raised with the council staff and we asked at that stage that PC 53-52 be withdrawn but we agreed in the end to carry on with mediation to see whether or not what the better shoe could be mediated as well as all the other issues with associated with the two appeals the car club genuinely tried to resolve the appeals and everyone made significant concessions including quieter please and the other parties and no one 's arguing about that and we did think at the end of those six long days that we had cracked up that it had been that we 'd been concluded however in our view quieter please for need agreement so following the conclusion of the mediation when the provisions were being drafted and sorted out quieter please sort through the reduced hours now we were always very clear in the mediation that it was a package deal because we were to talk about the details I can 't actually see the time that 's my difficulty yeah thank you yeah so just moving on so on that second-to-last slide I have just pointed out that in my submission and in the car clubs view it is the most sensible approach is to withdraw the plan change there 's no consensus between the parties the section 29 three processes very uncertain it is likely to be publicly notified anyway given the provisions that quieter please want to put in place phase two of the replacement plan is happening in any event the drafting is mostly complete and it will also allow further monitoring to take place over the summer months now that that logger is in place and I 've given you you should have in your package Alicia from the car club fear us giving some undertakings and they are in particular that they 'll continue to operate within the mediated agreement except with our existing bookings and then finally it is disappointed to be in this position doesn 't want to be here through the constraints would have serious this facility to ensure its continued financial independence for the good of the entire community thank you very much thank you and sadly you had a good time patience i 'm sure that would have been some and i certainly hit them but i won 't take them there is so thank you and we 'll come all over the 10 minutes thank you for that and the next deputation by appointment is andrew shorty _"

    "text": "oh nice decision ah okay we 've got the real one I thought he was just leaving um the next deputations by appointment f in relation to ruin a noise management and Sarah Sarah sorry don 't see the Sarah Hannah from quieter please and then there 's two others as well I didn 't declare any interest but it 's coming up and the feel free to OBX agenda but I have a conflict of interest with the subject so oh so you won 't take any part right okay and Sarah and um I 'm sorry I don 't know free Frank and John John cranky John and welcome and I think you know the rules 10 10 minutes is the usual period of time and that tends to include questions just so that counselors are aware this item is being dealt with today it 's in public excluded so just be a wee bit cautious and Peter 's here if you 're not sure whether the question should be asked and open meeting or not but thank you Cyril Frank and John we 're in your hands direct consequence of the previous city plan in 1995 which became operative in 1999 ruinous rules were then changed to allow motorsport to operate seven days a week from 9am till 11pm for 200 days 9 a.m. to midnight for 15 days and 9 a.m. till 10pm for the rest of the time noise levels were atl EQ and 95 Lmax for 200 days and for the rest of the time 90 l max and 65 ali q 45 of those days there were no noise limits back in 1995 anybody looking at the new proposed rules 120 days of use for example would have seen a very big nine proposed set of rules however the submissions from the car clubs all on record contained phrases such as we like noise and the more noise the better half of the fan of motorsport is the noise and the rest is history consequently operations at rural pune were much more commercially driven on what is a public reserve one does not need to be a noise expert to see that this was a recipe for disaster the World Health Organization recommends max respectively noise levels at the closest dwellings receive sound levels exceeding 65 l eq and 95 l max across many hours a day and frequently on weekends when people are at home in entitled to some rest and relaxation this is a community which when you think about it hosts a motor racing track and you can bet your bottom dollar that nobody else is putting up their hand to do that there has been a primary school in templeton on its present site for 140 years the children at that school spend their day with a background of noise especially in summer months we made it home they listened to it for another three or four hours and on weekends in the summer they fight to sleep over the noise of speedway on weekends the parks are swamped by noise from the track and on a bad day or with the right one direction they get to listen to it when they go to horn be more with their parents everyone has an opinion on ramona irrespective of the level of factual information rua pune was their first property owners who were bought out by the council in 2009 were there before the car club however this tit for tat over who was or wasn 't there first does not negate the necessity to comply with section 16 of the RM a duty to avoid unreasonable noise every occupier of land shall adopt the best practicable option to ensure that the emission of noise from that land does not exceed a reasonable level included in the Christchurch City Council corporate environmental policy statement 26 November 1997 our promote environmental care through the council 's influence over others prevention is better than cure it is always preferable to prevent an environmental problem emerging than to try to clean up afterwards polluter pays principle the organization or individual responsible for an environmental threat shall be the cost of cleaning up or prevention or of prevention equal priority principle the protection of the environment ranks equally with other business activities how does rua pune compared with other racetracks in a nutshell shamefully for example Western Springs has 14 days permitted use a year I have attached consents for a number of of pressure from residents plan change 52 was first notified in 2012 during this process the noise logger was installed on ruinous boundary data from that lager indicates that despite rope owners extremely liberal rules it is unlikely they had been complying for the past 10 years they are currently non-compliant bizarrely if the plan change is withdrawn and is inserted into the district plan this may mean that the benchmark is lifted to enable Rua poner to continue as they have been no doubt you will hear the argument that it is not possible for the car club to reduce their operation keep in mind then that rua pune operated for 40 years with a hundred and twenty days at 65 l max those were the days when neighbours Andrew Epona lived in harmony before the need for buyouts and plan changes no doubt you will hear the argument that rua pune is a community facility keep in mind then that to hire the facility the public reserved for a day in the summer costs three thousand dollars something i would suggest that most community and sports groups cannot you have been out to our area to see just what we 're putting up with keep we encourage you to spend a weekend in the area around the track this is not a small noise problem we all have far better things to do with our lives than spending time and money banging on about a small amount of noise if this was a small amount of noise we 'd all be home now getting on with our lives the way we used to do this noise has become so intrusive and so that we need to get it sorted out now rather than putting up with it for the next 20 years the council has done a great job at invite enabling a certain future for motorsport activities at gru Epona residents however have received the message that they almost deserve the noise and if nothing else this plan change is a step in seeking justice forcing the council to do the right thing quieter please does not want this plan change withdrawn at the 11th hour we have spent a great deal of time energy and money to ask council offices how many millions of rate payer dollars have been spent by you on lawyers consultants experts meetings by arts etc etc we recommend not withdrawing planned change 52 thanks Matt Serra and was there anything else any of the author shall I just take questions now I just question okay are there any questions from anyone just breath yeah hi thanks for that and you mentioned western springs having 14 days a year how does that compare to a poner now well as I said it 's dark they can operate 356 days 360 unusual it is very unusual though there are any other race tracks around the country the harbor well I have attachments there we go to chroma was the probably the one of the newer racetracks they have a maximum of 16 days motor racing in early annually there 's also attachments for levels and man field both of those types of categories so they have for example here a man field park category a 20 days at 90 max I think I started to work 80 days at 18 X and category what are you looking for for this apparently what quiet please are looking for is reduced days reduced noise levels and reduced hours its net said in a nutshell but how many days well we haven 't got a figure but it can move a long way from every day of the year let 's kind it is at the moment you know it 's under court process but you feel that you 're making progress in mediation process well I can 't really talk about okay i went to a mediation but that 's right okay thank you okay Pauline yes what sort of hours would you be looking at because you 're saying at the moment they go to 11pm with a candies of the rocks they carry the rules and what the hours that we would be looking at that as well as produced days and would reduce noise levels we would be looking at business hours nine to five in other weekend 96 at least I mean the minimum thank you okay thank you and one last question for slightly bitter clarity about the mediation thing a possible way or saved through some further or different mediation is it sort of possible way for us to be resolved for you it depends on the will of both parties i guess and i excised both parties so from your perspective is it possible well it also depends on where the plan change 52 is withdrawn and then it becomes null and void but it may be possible okay a very last question I think the question from cancer clear what it was if we don 't with to a plan change 52 and we keep it in are you still open to going through further mediation to try and resolve their issues I have to talk to our lawyer right or I can comment on it okay go for pulling I just want to know how many men does he have a new group and what the representation well it 's a business group prior to please and it 's well when plenty 50 tony was first notified they were 44 submissions 41 of those who are against what had been notified in our group I guess ten years and a fixed Township 15 put another fix your toast residents of your chest reason has put in a on a submission as well and when it 's been going on that long of course you come down to a few people doing most of the work so you think it 15 active members now who in the wizard but they would not necessarily the people that some letters of the people in temperate and you submitted there were people and your dues submitted and they don 't necessarily belong to quiet place but they are interested in kuna ok thank you for coming again thank you and we 're going to listen to the other two deputations about the item is obviously in public excluded so I can 't take it next because it means clearing out the chamber and and you can 't get to watch it anyway so it 's no help to you ok public excluded and public because as they come up at the panel and when we previously withdrew plan changes we turn public Mike do you want what do you want Court cases continuing activity before the council and the environment Corp attention of iron ball or potentially in mediation therefore that it 's NP ex-soviet council can 't have taken privilege legal advice on the course of action and should take within the different giving the other pages where that they were in front of the Environment Court Nestle corrected s okay yes we 've got economy in a locked case there 's wise thank you thank you very much indeed Sarah nice strong okay okay and _"

    "text": "okay so item 17 guys there why we wear addendum not sleep ender ender notes total seconds and is there anything you want to add Hayden ah not at the station can I just ask you one question in relation to the financial implications of adopting nurse and sorry and you 've said that there are no significant immediate cost implications in relation to the sewage treatment for example are their financial implications that are not covered in a current long-term team your plan my understanding is that they are all covered in the mounting financial pain yes that 's greed yet they are they okay there 's nothing additional there 's nothing additional yeah ok thank you thank you is there any debate yes Andrew and then yani a question sorry yeah yeah I too was interesting the financial implications what I was just a little bit unclear about the working party that 's been set up a little river flood mitigation working party that 's going to be making recommendations for funding to counsel do we do we have a date on when that is reporting and as answer that question lot behind the Working Party is actually being led by Environment Canterbury and it 's working through a process to look at how the community actually can support those that the whatever is required to resolve some of those issues but it 's certainly not imposing on the City Council any costings at the stage of sexy about us all working together and making sure that we can actually do things together the resolve those issues and it will be starting the coast more things please me yeah I just it was more just a timing of when if you read 5.4 this is implications for council work programs and budgets will be determined once the Working Party has reported to e KN and council I was trying to understand the timing of the report back and whether it 's some time to unfold a loss probably not I am I mean it would seem sensible that we should try and get some information to inform us through that because otherwise we 've done the budget and with my no provision it 's currently an environment category the end of the questions guys cuz I 'm good start debate Andrew thank you thank you um so this might be a relatively simple matter for the council this morning however for the zone committee this represents around 18 months of intensive and and involved work and I would draw councillors attention to the recommendations in particular those recommendations to the city council the why raila addendum addresses major issues in the zone such as flooding drainage sedimentation some of these are serious environmental issues some have wider impacts on the community significant steps have already been made to improving the management of the lake and improving the health of the lakers this document contains further recommendations to address issues of sedimentation sewerage phosphorus in the context of the lake environment so in short and the addendum contains a number of important recommendations which will impact on the environment and impact on the community the recommendations relating to flooding in Little River or a particular importance to that community the recommendations regarding the opening of the lake or a particular interest to the bird links flat community and the commend the banks peninsula water management as own committee for the excellent work and the hard and involved work which has been done to get this document to this point where it 's able to be approved and endorsed by council today and recommend to councillors to adopt the document today thank you indras said it 's some of that very well but I just want to add that I think this is a really good example of a zone committee working well it clearly includes the local Runanga the landowners community board and Emily it is and it 's good that I 'm Environment Canterbury are leading this and City Council have been involved so and like it will it will certainly support council like in the area that the flood mitigate whole area flood mitigation and that came out from what 's clear from our flood task force and it 's a really good example of the community and bored being involved in that whole area too so I certainly commend the recommendations to councillors actually had my endorsement to both of those comments but particularly the zone goes into these and there 's a lot of skills in the community as well in like you talked about the local knowledge it 's really excellent to see that being utilized and valued so I 'm supportive of this and I 'd like to congratulate you on the work you do to in hope that will you 'll be working closely with the land drainage recovery program as well to thank you I just wanted to endorse what was said and very quickly just make the point that what comes through this document really is that if you have a healthy environment then you can have a healthy economy and I think if you think about things like the impact of flooding few things about think about things like the productivity of the land it all comes back to having a healthy environment and that really comes through strongly in this so I 'm happy to accept that when these were set up I was skeptical but you know the weather you 've done it 's really proven me wrong and actually shown that actually this has been a safeguarding some of those really key environmental aspects that make Christchurch and the wider Canterbury such a unique place to live and of course the business so thank you for the work you 've done I think it 's a really good outcome so we 'll put the recommendation set around page 303 now the staff recommendations and removes pulling chickens put those those in favor please say aye those post carried thank you very much guys _"

    "text": "deputations by appointment and we have for the first is from the banks peninsula zone implementation committee and because it 's a relatively that 's simple and perhaps item on the agenda will take the item immediately after you guys have submitted and then come to the deputations by quieter please and the car club industry where sufficient okay welcome I think you 've probably understand the rules now but you get a 10 minutes of time and that includes questions yeah okay I 'll put down my head today it 's a community hat not a community bald head I 'm a community policing today and with me beside me I dropped um Kevin some who 's my who 's parbat azone committee and on my left here I 've got Nick big not who 's a planner with Environment Canterbury this process has been going on for a number of years now and the the officers report on page 301 outlined some of those things but the canopy water management strategies started about in 2005 by the Canterbury mayoral forum with a samosa fee of the Canterbury water solutions to these problems can be saved and implemented by the community with support from the council 's so we 've continued to move through that process working together bringing knowledge and skills to the table and the zone committee is a joint can see between weekend and the Christchurch City Council and I have some more of my players behind us sporting us we have produced a action plan for the pension reform implementation program and then over the last 18 months we have it you being preserved presenting a a flip-up which will from the sapling will be written to go into the land and water read you a plan around the Little River why we 're a catchment so we have an action plan with it 's got twin of recommendations to the City Council and it came on the issues it has been adopted by the zipper has been adopted by the Environment Canterbury commissioners and today we 're we 're asking you know you to come forward and adopter our our zipper as well so Kevin will talk through the action plan but just could kingsbury and his team that has spent considerable hours with us to come to the fruition of this process so Kevin okay there 's some team received the action plan the zipper which is addendum has 29 elements and the action plan and I covered in pages 17 to 35 our reason for being here quite clearly used to ask for your endorsement of our plan when we presented the zip last year one of the things that we noted was the uniqueness of ours up relative to other zips and the the great environment canterbury environment and the uniqueness was that as it requires a lot of city council input a lot more than the other nine zones that Trine 's continued with what we have here an hour while addendum so why do this why be involved the key reasons are that there are community benefits both local to the little river community and to the wider community they 're also environment benefits for our for our lifetimes and obviously for those lifetimes after hours and it 's the community that 's the Runanga perspective in particular I that might have or do have significant city council involvement from a local community perspective one of the key issues in our engagement process and that 's a process that 's been extensive through the development of this addendum was the flooding and Little River we 're all aware of that we have engaged in a research as to the causes of their flooding and in methods to mitigate that flooding our addendum asked for the city plan to buy into some actions which will help with that mitigation process we 're looking for city plane and district plan changes or responses and areas such as drainage such as the planning the planning rules in terms of development and the and the risk areas and in the areas that contribute to that flooding and we 're looking for something a little bit unique in terms of what 's at some banks manager at the moment and that 's the establishment of a drainage rating district for Little River an idea that 's been put forward over the last 30 years but now has more engagement probably than its head and community perspective the the lake tiroteo a wide river offers opportunities for contact recreation but it can only do that if we can manage its health better and if that health is quite dependent on the phosphorous content within that lake currently there 's about 11.3 tons a year of phosphorous entering the lake about 1.7 tons of years vacate a year vacating the lake there 's a phosphorus build-up that contributes to to problems with the health of the lake in particular with the growth of organisms that are not healthy for human or for animals or even for the floor and for around the lake edge we want help with trying to reduce that level to something like 1.8 tons over the next 20 years how can sit accounts will contribute to that the flood mitigation is one part because that limits the sediment that fall comes into the lake carrying phosphorous but there 's also issues of sewage in the in the Little rivers area we are asking for the City Council 's input to a high level treatment plant that actually includes the removal of phosphorous phosphorous available in that environment to be transported into the lake environment we 're looking for upgrade of the infrastructure in the area to again reduce the input into the sewage system which in turn reduces the phosphorous development we 're looking for help with water storage and water efficiency measures for the local community those things can be incorporated within district plans the P process as we call it the phosphorous issue needs a lot of further research that research has been ongoing in the last two years at the request of the same committee as part of our work on the zip with e keen with City Council resources and put it into it already but it needs to continue further and that partnership needs to be e cane City Council Runanga and the other affected or environments such as ourselves as own committee we want you to buy into that research process and support us going forward in developing techniques to better improve the health of the the lake very well itself and of the wide river couch catchment this reduced the P in the lake at the city and the Little River Township the health of the rivers and the use of the land and the wider rear attachment it requires an engaged partnership of the parties weary crease that city counts will show their engagement initially today by endorsing the presented zipper deemed them for the library were catchment we now welcome questions if you have any thank you for the presentation and thank you for the work that you 're doing I guess at a high level when the water zone committees and the whole water management strategy was set up I guess one of my skeptical concerns was that it very much be about economic development at the expense of the environment from the reports that you 've got can you just kind of give me a bit of a high level understanding around how that economic development and environmental effects are being are working in balance or or you know what safeguards are being put in place or being recommended we 've got in place in regards to at the Environmental Protection because the feel I get from the report is it the core assumption but I think it would be good just to get from you guys a bit of more of an understanding about what those trade-offs have been can I just need to get your question clear are you saying a trade-off between effectively limiting development at the expense of at the benefit of improving the environment yeah I think controlling the negative environmental consequences of the economic development opportunities and I think that 's the key balance is not if you look at you can take things as cause in response or you can take these things as let 's be a little bit proactive and develop the systems before we allow the development and that 's that 's the approach we 've taken for example if you put in a high level surge treatment facility you offer the opportunity to for greater development if we put in a high quality and it actually is only a change in the way we 're managing the land environment in terms of flood mitigation and perhaps lift the level of one bridge we actually open up the Little River Township be negative to each other but the two have to work together to actually enable both to prosper and that 's the approach that we 're taking that 's why in fact this this committee has engaged so much in research both with the community we 've spent time with people have been in that community for 60 years talking to them about what the the environment was like 60 years ago when they were kids growing up we 've spent time with researchers talking about what caused the floods will then spent time with other researchers saying what have you done other than other environments that have actually improved the the flooding things and it 's simple things like willows growing in the environment we thought the solution was to take them out on the past now they say that causes the banks to collect sand cause sediment problems so we 're trying to look at ways of improving on that now out of all of that work comes the opportunity for greater development because now you 're managing the environment and in a way that is prosperous for phosphorus come from naturally out of the soils from septic tanks from a number of ways from the birds there 's a number of ways but the soil has got a lot of naturally got a lot of phosphorous or not as does the lake bead it sits at the moment with quite a high phosphorus content which kind of gets whipped up with the front with different storms and obviously window fix and it 's low impact the lake level controls quite important because you can mitigate those effects if I like floor depending on the depth of a lake you mitigate the temperature that like there 's a lot of complicated factors that all contribute together together to create the P problem but as as PM said the fundamental source of the phosphorus is that the natural soil over on the peninsula has a high phosphorus content if we can limit the movement of that soil into our Lakes then we can mitigate the phosphorus problem thank you thank you and just to make it helpful for you we 'll do that item now so that you 're look forward to your help so items 17 _"

    "text": "is the one that 's in a separate little agenda item separate little piece of paper expansion of fair and equitable rates remissions with quite a good report very clear report with a recommendation which Tim would like to move and Paul would like to second and Ellie would like to okay okay do you mind him if Ellie moves that okay Ellie 's moving and Paul seconding right can I put it vote Johnny to check on 5.22 and so I wanted to move that if that is included ever got the staff person writing near bus sorry guys haven 't seen much of you today p the thing missing is what I do okay so the suggestion is in relation to 5.2 to the businesses that are unable to access due to surrounding fences and the suggestion would be that from yonni is that that be included want to comment on that so it is covered off with respect in the paper particularly around 314 and through the analysis around this in summary we would actually go back to the executive summary and talk about how the rate administer and provides minimal ability to apply judgment so it 's those types of aspects are coming through and we need to make sure that we 're applying relief only when it is more efficient to do so through the rating the rating system and also that the rates currently as you can see under 23 have the impact of increasing existing ranked players rates already so it is a case of only using the rate mechanism as a help when it 's absolutely necessary and appropriate under there I won 't turn to Steve to talk about that particular one here they 're instantly whether it was particular example here yet and my understanding is it 's not a council or a seer offense so I suppose one of the key issues here is if we adopt something like this how many people would actually benefit from it because in the muck in the main my understanding is that the fences around town are our private fences put their really for for safety purposes but there 's nothing stopping the owners accessing if there are they 've got agreements in and do work to the site finding the 3.4 12 the suggestion was that if we were to adopt something like this we 'd have to keep it quite restrictive and keep it within the principles I think of what we 're doing in other cases where if people are being held up in their abilities but we progress because of something that council or sara is doing or not doing then that makes sense but like so my understanding of these fences is that generally prime offenses and and that situation just doesn 't fly okay thank you it 's very clear the report itself is very clear do you want to move something different game I I want to support our debt 5.22 and 523 the other no move them to be adopted and I support the staff okay let me suggest that that we just put these separately so that we can cover it off I 'm assuming you 've all read the report and formed an opinion do you want to debate it or are you clear well I 'd like to speak okay so just vote against five point no because he 's okay with five point two point one okay i 'll put that causes in 5.2 25.2 separately how would that be yeah okay so five point one is where they are suggesting that this be adopted okay this is news to buy absolute johns and sing to by council lonsdale can I put that I 'm just putting 5.1 at the moment and all that subsea okay those in favor please say aye those opposed right 5.2 15.25 point to one is that it not be adopted for properties experiencing continuing significant delays in their insurance settlement I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed can I have a show of hands that so I 'm putting what is in front of you 5.2 suggests that the following not be adopted to not get rates rebates because of all of the issues outlined in here yeah okay it is a double negative and that 's confusing okay so 5.2 i 'm still on 5.21 if that 's okay because i didn 't get a clear indication so that this not be adopted five point two point one right I 'm just putting these separately it is actually but only at you because you 're always thinking about other people I 'm so you know you 're right I just wanted to make really clear about this just in case there is some confusion because this was one of the things that I originally brought up and want to drop their the reporters fantastic and makes it really clear just to clarify further the main reason why the ensure this is insurance delays yeah we 're on that one yeah the main reason why that just that can 't_''_376.02 be something that we can consider to apply a rates from mission to is because it 's inconsistent with the policies that we put in place relating to rates remissions or rebates so we would actually be inconsistent with our own policies if we approve that this is not something that council has any control over or as a resulting from anything that counselors doing so I just needed to make that really clear because yeah and I 've 'm putting five point two point one okay and that this is not be adopted for this okay can I put that those in favor that it not be adopted for those please say it please raise your hand 123456789 way past okay those opposed does anybody want it recorded against right ok so that was passed five point to point to that it not be adopted for that so it 's exactly the same did you want to speak to that one angry I 'd like to ask a question first of all and then I might want to for that own amendment actually if we look at the clause three point four point one one in the report any rate for mission should in principle only apply where the fencing is in place because of counsel or Syria requirements we don 't know whether they 're still our properties they 're affected by care by fencing which is there by counsel or Sarah requirements we 're making an assumption that there may not be any or there may not be many but if not if following the staff were to be passed then there may be a small number of properties that may not be able to be accessed because of cereal or council fences that would actually fall to a gap that we may not choose to leave there so if the amendment if the what have we got we 've got a proposal by jonnie2 jonnie2 vote against this as i understand it actually right so so yummy I 'm intimate is that it be included yeah so are you going to be more specific than that because let me give a creative example down Mackenzie and Willis way with it a building that 's burnt down I 'm assuming that 's a counselor or a seer offense that 's there I am not keen to subsidize the delay on doing anything on that with council monies I want them to sort it and fix it is that the community committee from high street and there 's been only one of the case I 'm aware of which is down around the lower men chester street is basically these fences would sometimes put up because of confusion over who actually owns them but generally the idea is that they would get a 30-percent rates remission or they just go to the land value so you know I 'm Island suggest 116 okay so what are you what would you like to suggest because we 'll see if there 's some traction well I wanted to move to it okay the land value okay so that and you want to confine it to where the fencing and places because of counsel or Sarah requirements and where the purpose of the fencing is to prevent owners and insurers from accessing the building so that you 're quite clear about who you 're talking about yeah I 'm not I mean well let 's just look at three point four point one one any rates were missing shirt and principal only play with fencing and as in place because of counsel or Sarah requirements and where the fence pips of the fencing is to prevent oh and insurers from accessing the building so can I suggest if you want to move an amendment at least stick to some guidelines move three point four point one two three point four point one two is that it not be adopted sorry what that 's just the chance to be adopted but it oh I see the Lord a suggestion there okay yeah yeah what I was going to suggest was if if this is and it may well be that Jonnie and I talking exactly the same language to move essentially the wording in three point four point one one that has the amendment that beer okay you know I 'm taking it from the paragraph at the top of the page but it 's the same thing okay so I think ya knees just doing it from three point four point my dear yeah mrs. on johnny is moving that a rates remission of thirty percent consistent with other business remissions should apply only in those wordings and let report Chris are you okay with it yes just for clarity the risk of just repeating what we just said that it responds councillors Turner 's previous question is more correct yeah and there could be ones that fall through the report is we 're just not aware of any that we believe it 's just not something is going to have a lot of volume yeah but the very marginal wording here is for exactly this reason yeah if you in my view if there are we I would want them included and what 's been proposed allows them to be included there may not be any but it avoids any business premises that may be in this situation from falling through the cracks when it may not be council 's intention to allow them to fall through the cracks and operationally that 's achievable they would approach us and we can do some investigation of rigor so can I be clear on this mackynzie and Willis for example which I think just looks appalling at the moment and the building next to it in high street would they now get a rate remission if we pass this I don 't know given that lets a capsule or Sarah fence around them it would need to be 22 righty really here just firstly there 's nothing is a bit if I yani moves and entry sequence is that right what 's here um can I those in favor please say aye those opposed I 'm definitely opposed I want my vocal cords against it um wait showed up here I 'm right so that once carried okay and then the food one is in relation to residential properties not subject well okay do you have some comment on that guys what are you actually moving yummy before they call me boss I just wanted to I mean it seems to me that that do the very few properties are at that are not read zoned that are in this category and I don 't know where the staff can think of a number but it does seem if your property has been demolished because it 's unsafe for example the other had a nice one to four and it 's an hour vacant section you don 't qualify for right to mission and yeah if you just had a vacant section and in the same by adjacent to it never had a house on you 're getting a full remission I don 't think this applies to a lot of people I think it much the small handful can I just get some commitment stuff yeah he was saying the the original remission some time ago was related specific to those section 124 notices that were given under the order in council for rock roll and cliff collapse it 's always been the case that because section 124 notices are attached to buildings rather than to land if someone did have a section 124 on their house the logic behind that was going back a step is that those people are unable to live in their homes they 're also unable to make progress with any kind of insurance repair or anything else they may not even be any damage to that might just be the wrist behind it so the principle same just discussed before they 're unable to progress daily life because of something outside their control it 's always been the case that if they did have a damaged home and demolished it they left the vacant section because the section 124 is therefore lifted because there on the vacant section in the same way as any other owner of vacant land now that may have been an unintended consequence of the initial remission and that 's why it 's being investigated here because I think that 's what 's raised last time at council your house is right before the argument in this paper is saying well that logic makes perfect sense for again those situations where people cannot proceed with their lives because of something the council needs to do and this is similar to the flocked or not the flocks I 've gotta stop calling that the March flooding events where people who are out of their homes generally we didn 't give them a rates remission but if they 're out of their homes and couldn 't make progress until after we had done our remedial work then we were going to give them a rest remission and it 's the same principle but this mass land movement here people who can 't progress with Alaska to something that we need to do first then we give them the remission the argument in one in that situation with rock rock is what the port hills guys have told me that there 's no remedial work that council is doing for rock roll or cliff collapse so there 's no one waiting for us to take action that 's why if we put this in place Libby 's basing our customers young I 've both receives a couple of emails from people who have sections so now the district plan getting it up being put in the category one so they can 't do anything on the section at all now they can 't build on it I can 't do anything and some of those actually are on areas where we are actually doing some mitigation on some of the stuff from the pickup skeletal 0 0 0 I think there are a couple that if you will fit under this category yeah my question related to almost exactly the same thing that Paul 's just raised are we assuming that there 's nobody in this situation or do we know that they 're definitely firstly is nobody in this situation secondly is again a little bit like the business one I would rather set the framework so that we do capture anybody that subsequently appears to be in this group even though we may think it may not capture anybody i think is worth doing to avoid any future in equity or unintended consequence yeah understood it was a definitive advice from peter Doolin who may know who 's running the port hills work for us he told me that council is not doing any remedial work for all general reader will work for rock railroad cliff collapse and that 's quite unlike the mass land movement where we are doing some and so there aren 't people in different situations yes um if you hit a vacant section and so just tell us what you want so it should be a hundred percent all right yeah uh-huh can I just go fight the cases at the Council of receipt of the staff they can refer to the staff and as to where they would be eligible not do we know about poses as examples it so i can just quote you just another question is have the staff being able to look at those to see if they would qualify okay well I pass it on to stuff that 's it very question well okay removing one hundred percent we 're told that there are no people in this property in this category you 're telling us this true okay can I put that it 's moved counselor your heads and seconded counselor lonsdale right okay I 'll put five point two point three as Pythia those in favor please say aye aye those opposed no but it 's carried okay so i 'll put that whole amended report as it narrows those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and I think that takes us to the end of the public agenda and there are four or five items and public excluded do you want a five minute break before we go into those we need to get the filming out anyway okay can we be back because I 'm supposed to have a four o 'clock meeting and can we be back at three got ten minutes said ok 3 55 volts _"

    "text": "I community center in library rebuild project right this has gone with this actually coming from hello by Moses Nate Collins yes it 's project manager yeah this is a seeking to confirm a couple of resolutions that have been sitting on the table for some time and we spoke with the chief executive around bringing him back here they were on the table at the time because we didn 't have funding confirmed as you 're aware counselor confirmed money for this project so what we 're really looking for today is for just cleaning out the last two deer which are confirmation of option to which the community and the community board support and also then the second one at 6.2 allowing us to get on and start a wider consultation exercise and really just get on with the project cool I just want to move staff recommendation minus 6.1 the the reason for that being is that the deputation chem in the support of getting the money on the budget not HD option to the option two is a way of actually facilitating how much we need close to what they want but we 've got a joint replicator being set up first meeting is on the twenty-third of this month and that will the community come together in a sea of a look I didn 't see so what do you want to actually move for so just just just remove 6.1 and leave in 6.2 and when she move their motion are you guys okay with it um yes yes we could live with that there um I think probably when we go back to the community we need to set some parameters and I think having the library on the ground floor as a as a set parameter but pretty much everything else I 'm really looking forward to sitting with the Joint Working Group and and discussing those things so yep that 's okay okay you seeking doing that Jonnie you are ok just to say I 'm a little bit concerned to hear that we 're going to go on with a set parameter of having the library on the ground floor we don 't know what the community thoughts are given 's why I would support having an open conversation because it might be following that conversation there 's new options that put on the table given how long this has been around and given the developments that are happy with things like the adjacent red zone etc etc so you know I just want to be really clear that we 're going to our community with an open mind dresser it 's up to try and understand we ever add at this point I think that 's what Paul 's moving is not yes the same page so you take him 6.1 out ya know just heard stuff side one of the set conditions of the library has to go on the ground no he said his view was that the library should go on the ground floor he 's being very honest it 's very feared and actually if you want an accessible library our ground floor library makes a great deal of sense it 's a far that 's yeah I mean however what Paul is moving what you 're seeking he has just 6.2 right okay yep is open in a dislike for example the earlier surveys showed that less than forty percent of people see if they 'd go to use the museum and it looks like that so far the get is included in what will be consulted on so I 'm just want to ask the staff if if that 's going out for consultation on that basis with me staying with the library and the community center and the museum is another risk that this would be predetermined I don 't think there 's a risk if I think certainly a start we 've been in discussions with the museum group and they 're very aim to be part of this project and we 'd like them to be part of this project what we 're proposing in the current concept is there is a museum space upstairs which is I think about 30 40 square meters but we 're also proposing to have glass display cabinets throughout the library and throughout the atrium so that it connects really well with people that come and come along and use the library so we their part of this project okay Allie then Andrew Christian around the purchase of the land for pocket park because i believe that 's at a cost of around a million dollars for the pocket park note that the pocket park is on the sites but council already owns the purchase of land for a million dollars is it support car parking right so we don 't know yet how many car park is going to be required for this project with commissioned and independent traffic assessment which is required for the resource consent and that should give us an idea it 'll take into account cycle cycle parking where the buses run one of those good things and then then we 'll have we 'll have a bit of an idea as to how much land we need for car parking could you use land though frock that is put aside for the pocket park for packing the reason i ask as i see that the number of people who would use a pocket park is thirty percent italy did the pocket park is is something that we would on it but there are people in the community that don 't wish to have a pocket park as well so it 's something that I think will be high on the agenda for the for the Joint Working Group to discuss I think some of the space that we 're showing it in the plan at the back of the pocket park is really important for mobility parks which we have to provide on-site so that clean yes the reason I 'm asking is is there a trade-off for the million dollars which I still can 't get my head around to buy land for car parking yeah a million dollars for that when you could use what could be used for the pocket park for the car parking I 'm just there a trade-off there possibly but until we know how many car parks are required and you can pick any number and i 'm not i 'm not sure what that will be but i don 't think the space which is currently allocated to the pocket park will be enough to provide full car parking for um 6.1 is taken out but it it does concern me that we would be proposing a preferred conceptual design before the working group has actually met we need to take a grassroots up approach to these sort of projects I opened Alvin square in Littleton on Saturday and that in my world was a perfect example of community involvement in council leg project or maybe even council involvement in a community-led project and I think sometimes we need to turn our thinking on its head and allow a grassroots off approach to be the way forward working with communities and doing with rather than doing toe and I think you know where we 've got projects that have run successfully like Albion squares one of the few council projects I 've been involved with the dive hood I would go so far as to say no negativity and supported by the community and there was a very honest and open two-way conversation between the community and council staff in a way that came to some some very honest realizations about firstly what the community wanted but then secondly what need to look at where we 've worked well and think of those sort of projects as exemplars where we can replicate that kind of behavior so I certainly I 'm happy to have 6.1 gone from there and I think they 're just needs to be a an open space where the community can have a conversation about what they actually wants which is informed by good quality staff advice and you know informed technical opinion and I don 't want to undermine that in any way but there just needs to be a good informed conversation based on a concept of doing with the community rather than doing to the community okay is there any other new points that need to be made or can we vote on this now a page for 994 point2 points for the summary of the results with regards to the surveying I may have mustard but how many people were surveyed um I couldn 't give you an answer to that I 'm sorry but I can find out those figures are impressive however if three people were surveys sure thank you to the scene madam chair if I 'm 55 may at least three at least 300 so it was a good size sample it 's a very good size up or something yeah okay right can I put the amended recommendation just Emily responding to the survey though what was the response rate did it come up the survey was done and some of our the mobile vans so it was done over a two-week period at that Community Connection you in terms of your tag all their audience what was your sponsor through what was the response rate yeah oh very high out of trainer big having them oh you 're 300 people gave the opinion so it 's people who were in the square on that over there period hey this is but it 's 300 out of we don 't know out of sumner I having it let 's jump family live in summer yeah okay we 're going on it was a high response rate I mean the Venus the earth full times a week yeah these are some people they 're going to tell you you know a museum I 'm not overly convinced that reporting the feedback it 's very good feedback and it 's an excellent way of getting attention yeah okay can I put this what 's before us okay put their those in favor please say aye those opposed carried to want your vote record to get stored Division II could you record Ellie 's webkinz thank you and _"

street shops up you know basically from Braun up through there up to Morehouse and across so but that would only be a local cycle route that we 'd be proposing there so if all these things come to pass it will be a hugely improved little service for cycling within the city you know from that area because you get you will get two major cycle routes and they will connect them with you know basically the the south till one so what I guess the question then is what commitments do i need to make because if i look at integer street the cycle line isn 't really just from the desert detail design that we have doesn 't it 's not separated off road it doesn 't really look like a substantial cycle way so can i move that we we make it a more prominent away see through you madam chair the antiguos street cycle route as hagley park those are the two key cycle routes shown in an accessible city whereas Elwyn street would only be a local cycle route connection project before council today tp1 a for hospital corner are those interim early changes to the streets in this area the transport project 1 b which is actually the bulk of the funding for the upgrading of antiguos street and the other streets council 's looking at today would be the subject of separate consultation and the intention at that stage would be to deliver those fully separated cycle facilities on antiguos street so this is interim works today there are the so there 's the major desire is to put circles into antiquey where runs and sell hats and i am from Grove Road across me yeah that is the staff when at the desire line where people come yet from the hospital yes through salem street got that so i can I just be clear because the sheets that we have shown intersection improvements to antiguos street are you saying that that 's not funded well that 's not part of this today no as I think the consultation booklet makes clear there are there are a further stage of improvements to come to these streets this project is currently around 1 million of the nine point three million sheduled for transport project one Hospital corner which is summarized as and so yeah there would be proposals in future for the foot for further enhancement today antequera street route okay and that becomes the major suck away okay I had a lot butcher put somewhere really so his knees pulling my question was is the very top alcohol at the moment you know we 've certainly heard it 's pretty we 're here it 's been well utilized and the shuttle from the air to the airport is working really well so do you I mean sorry to the hospital so that 's been well utilized be nice first what if it 's still here capacity Lloyd for another putting car parts i 'll say it probably would i look I think there 's there 's 900 or the year so this is original okay thank you um yeah I think the concerns around parking here are probably more focused around business premises closer to more as a venue where there there are considerable shortages of parking availability that Pauling Tim were you next yeah thank you for remembering um follow on from elias christian heard you thought of getting the the parking between north of Morehouse Avon cell 1 60 minutes so those long-term packs were all day packs would chain that hot than the whole nature of that parking area would change because the argument from the businesses as those packs asked for their clients who obviously would come in and out be gone within an hour surely got think there 's a wider piece of work that needs to be done because the land uses throughout the central city have changed and there 's a need to go out and look at a lot of that on street parking thank you okay did I leave somebody up Dave the development of the networks on either side we 've got the Hagley ab circle way possibly antiguos street and i think it 's a bit of a Foley to start doing things and so when Street particularly when we don 't know what 's happening over the other side of it on the southern side so I 'm okay can and this is any through the debate debate on this on this on the seventh Street one because we 've got de clearly a range of views and can i it 's a fool this is the amendment that puts the cycle lane there instead of the current 14 or 16 k-pax just so we 're clear what we 're voting on I think largely I think there are also some other changes to in on 6.86 and get to the guts of it is there a seconder for this pauline right and can we we 've kind of debated it are we okay to vote on it now right okay can we vote on essentially and this recommendation which replaces the current k-pax and so on street with a cycle lane for that part of someone 's straight okay can i perhaps if you 're a favor of it could you say I i if you 're opposed can I just have a we show of hands if you 're a favor favor sorry one two three four five if you that 's the cycle way yep if you it sorry go again if you 're in favor one two three four five if you 're a post one two three four five castell go that is great no I didn 't about we can ask you to vote I didn 't vote I don 't have a kisser nothing here nobody hit yet no I haven 't voted at all because i actually think there 's a and I heard the submitters and actually what I there but I think just going like that to the businesses is too tough I think what we should signal is that the parking stays for a limited period of time and then goes so the partner I 'm following it Vicki we could I guess move that the pocket the parking be put in on a temporary basis yes that 's revile basis that 's where we actually got to it the the earlier committee that the park and stayed for a limited period of time and that the signal was clear to the businesses that this would be replaced with a cycle lane but I think just doing it over night was a bit vicious on them so I think there 's been it 's been it 's been indicated in the original plan however yeah well that 's that 's where i was going to move to refer to today yeah so i 'm wondering if we could get to some sort of compromise like that this would allow the businesses to plan for the fact that their parking changes and I think it should become short people a chance to change the way we doing things so can I suggest just as a way through it that that the parking stays for a limited period of time maybe one to two years you can pick a number and that it becomes time limited in the meantime yeah and and well the reason the really agree with psycho eyes everywhere as we know from the debate the other day but I also agree that there are two very good cycleways either side of this so this is this does need to allow for those businessman that came and were as passionate as the ones that came in today I 'm not wanting in the middle of a hospital rebuild to completely destroy their businesses for them so I appreciate that there is huge pressure on this area at the moment for a year okay so we 've got the temp art and here but the council signal said it will be removed force local cycleways in the meantime the parking becomes time-limited said ok sorry just it 's up to counsel um so well I 'll brave let 's just let 's just get this through so it so what do you want one year or two years gorgeous yeah staff said that the the cycle lane was going to be put under in the next 10 years so if we 're going to say take parking out for a cyclone in two years but the planning for that cycle of way could be ten years later leave it all isn 't it oh I 'd say could we review it in two years okay it 's giving them good hit ok ok so the parking remains as it is for no more than two years council signals that this space will be required for a local cycle way in in the future and will review this parking provision within that two year period but ok ok Andrew then Ellie I 've got a question and then I 'd like to make a comment the expense involved in changing potentially going with one program and marking the road and changing the the car parks and so on and then going back in say two years time and any further consultation or just the expense in the road markings and the signage and so on I mean this is actually another piece of work that we 're creating here isn 't it yeah just did straight through you madam chair yeah that is another piece of work and I think what we need to do would be to review the park in the air we 'd have to go out and consult on it there 's an obligation for us to do that and we 'd have to bring it back to council with recommendation as to whether to change the park in from long state of short stay or something like that it was simple okay sorry just can I follow up on that Andrew is it just the time limited nature of the parking that needs consulting on given that you 've consulted on whether this becomes cycleways or parking I believe so yeah okay so if we say the parking remain for no more than two years and that the council signals that the space will be required for a local cycleway in the near think we might have to come back for the cycleway per se into in a couple years yeah no but I mean at the moment is the only bit that you would have to go back out to people on the time limited nature of the parking do we really have to consult on that yes in the short term madam chair and he would need to consult over the change to those parking control arrangements okay so if we lift them as they are but just limit their life to no more than two years without time limiting them in the meantime do you have to do anything additional I think we would probably need to freshly consult then over the implementation or cycle lanes and two years time yes no no that 's fine that 's fine I 'm just worried about not doing and I guess that that 's not under accessible City and the funding for that it was part of the accessible City network would also come under that that 's fine so we 're putting a cycleway there we 're just not doing it but if there was a need to go back out and consult on that is that what I 'm hearing because they need to go back out in two years or whenever we decide to put cycleway there that would be a new proposal we would need to consult on again think that 's my view yeah that 's the fact and that recognizes the the comments or the point i was about to make what i 'd written down here um recognizes the fact that you know lot can change it to you stakeholders the owners of those businesses may in fact be different people so the view of the existing business owners and the view of the business owners at that time may well be different circumstances may well be different to make a decision now about what we think might happen there in two years time you know I think leaves us on reasonably shaky ground in terms of the existing consultations are you reflective that in your answer but what I 'd written down here was um do it once and do it well provide certainty business owners regardless of what the answer is certainty is a big part of their considerations and provide future opportunities so I 'm actually not in support of this amendment for those reasons right Ellie the concern I had with the amendment as it says for no more than and I think that 's really painting us into a corner I thought we had discussed the possibility of putting the word review in there so that it could be reviewed in two years but i do not see the logic behind setting that and I concrete when you may not have a psycho way to join it to for up to a decade okay so can we just suggest that the parking remain as is for the fourth at the present the cut to be reviewed within two years I or the parking suggestion and here was originally that it remained the same because that was the recommendation of the infrastructure committee right I 'm a point of clarification yep whatever you later feels like I said have moved this but no I will change their vm see if there recommendations an agenda that they would apply and that is what 's up there would be would change and so the original recommendations did indicate that didn 't they because the infrastructure committee had that had listened to those people and actually suggested that their parking should remain for a period is that right the ones in our air printed agenda indicate there is that right so so so I 'm assuming actually all we either had to do is pass Phil 's amendment which changes that into cycleways now or go back to where we were in the recommendations that are before us from that committee which actually lift the parking as it was in the short term yes that 's correct right so we don 't need any of this amendment um the mid the amendment signals that you know will review it in two years time and the council was proposing to put a local local site away in there which just gives direction to staff don 't go out within a couple of years and go through that process does it does the Watson the agenda I think what we had in the original recommendation to Council was that the parking remain okay there 's a trick changes vision that you got up there would say that that breaks like it was right ok so this the packing remains for a shortened period from what was in the original proposal from your committee phone yeah so you 're gonna put through your other proposal up first which other proposal well the wonders there on in now no this is a further amendment it sizzle no we haven 't gotten amendment the amendment was wasn 't carried okay right so this is a further amendment that I 'm happy to move as somebody happy to second with Paul or second okay so this is different from what 's in the paper and that it signals that the packing won 't go what the signal set the parking will likely go what 's in your paper leaves the parking near okay so this is a halfway point between what 's it I 'll take myself off because I 'd rather leave the parking here but this is an so you don 't want to see in it is there a seconder otherwise it 's just going to lips ok ten seconds ten seconds yeah yeah I 'm still really unfair about antiguos tree and the timing of the works so as a cycleway going into antiguos tree as part of this decision okay can we just get their answer for you getting likely time so it 's like a lenticular street so this is TP 1a it 's just getting the traffic moving the right direction we 're designing tp1 be now we hope to bring some initial drafts of that fall before christmas early next year okay yes very so the circle way and antiguos street assuming that all goes ahead would likely be there in well soon we have to go through a consultation process etc etc so sometime next year but have we just done the consultation like you 're putting a new artistic that 's from 141 a it 's it give us its funding just within this first base programmer next thank you turn to page 3 59 and look at TV one contiguous st. SF traffic controls fix-it Rho TP 18 until you a straight to egg liev so I 'm still struggling to understand why integra straight is being done but what is actually being done later given what we 're being asked to make recommendations on in tickets tree today I don 't understand so this is simply TP 1a is simply the getting things going getting them on and on the ground tp1 be is to mention earlier on as that substantive nature of the work that 's changing the curb and channel in certain areas and one of the things we want to do was work closely with the hospital over that whole area or ensure that any few of the works are integrated with what they 're proposing because they 've got a huge schedule of works and the wider area and we don 't want to rush ahead to put on infrastructure which isn 't the appropriate okay can I just suggest a format for which we will put this amendment in a minute and then if unless there 's in yet if this fails then will revert to the motion that 's currently before us okay so can I put this now those in favor please say aye those opposed to clear that carry does that visually yeah okay so can we reflect that and so now we 've dealt with the pipes on morehouse f we dealt with the blind Institute the Karina 's submissions I dont still that was being noted by the staff and think that could be limited we 've dealt with the shared cycleways and that they stay as they are for snow on street parking bus lanes and I didn 't think there was going to be a lot of traction on the timing issue so I didn 't think you 'd want to debate that and is there anything else or can i put the motions as amended you can use you can do that so i 'm going to phils going to move the motions as amended and Jimmy 's going to second okay any debate honey thank you I appreciate that stuff we 've done a lot of work on this project I 'm appreciate that just want to remind counselors that we 've got huge budget shortfalls we 've got about 80 million dollars of money we have to find for the traffic or the accessible transfer plan that we still haven 't budgeted for there 's two hundred million dollars more of words that we have to do that we have no idea how it 's going to be funded and that isn 't even on top of the considerations who have just been through in the last few days around our capital works projects let alone what we need to do with our own cycleways and and i just want to remind cancers of the diagram that we saw of all the broken roads and broken pipes that are not going to be fixed because there 's no funding there 's no money on budget so ask yourself if you have limited financial resources is this the best speed of the limited money that we have when there 's other things that need to be done in the city in my view looking at all the different considerations is no this is not has very little skirt repair so actually the opportunities that we should take as a priority are to align with the skirt repairs we 've already lost that opportunity for kilmore and sales very street it 's got nice brand new curve and channel but we 've spent not a cent on doing the transport plan enhancements that are in this plan that 's extra money we have to find because we didn 't take that opportunity we cannot afford to keep spending money in this way so i would say that fixing the broken water pressure mains that have been put on hold fixing the broken roads that are leading to things like flooding and fixing the wastewater that is leading to things like raw sewage going into our rivers as should be a priority I don 't buy the argument that this has to be done to support the new bus interchange the new bus interchange is going into the middle of a broken city a city that is going to be a construction zone if you just think of the health precinct and you think of the construction that is happening in this specific area and the demands that all have on local parking what the demands will have on the streets why would you spend money now making these changes rather than wait for that to happen then coming afterwards when you don 't have the same financial pressures when you 've got the majority of that work done and then you would actually put on these changes in a final part I just want to make is that I believe this traffic is going to make this the unaccessible city you can 't just do these puts these bits of the transport plane and isolation from the wider picture and I think the congestion that you 're going to see from these proposed changes is going to be astronomic I do not believe this will enhance the city so I urge you not to support this today it should be deferred we should wait we have the full transport clean funded before we consider what these priorities are good those in favor please say aye aye those opposed do you want it recorded yep we can do one of those man dead one those today yep okay if you 're in favor would you please do your magic on the machine don 't think you 're working you don 't think they 're a working machine it 's a good scheme do you want one too because some people want their vote recorded for posterity yes it is you said is however if you were requested for a division you can like anyone may request a division has been requested don 't honestly if you say I will have my vote recorded against six of one half dozen of the other yes that 's true it 's absolutely true yes and I will just remind people that the speaking time unless you 're the mover of the motion was three minutes okay right I 'm assuming the way through did it Oh different clean came back okay boat again guys all done it we 've done it twice every okay what do you back my hunch is that the voters everybody in the room for its it for yani who 's against yeah right okay passed there didn 't we with those amendments yep I 'd get out of here while you can thank you very much guys and for n Ginny and the team for the consultation to go home and enjoy the weekend and item number 30 _"

    "text": "the path on the base of your memo that rich has been made it so far not i think is please everybody so a bit path and that picture with 22 meter powers as a half-meter get it was most cycleway say off road now the body gets is probably 300 white or something like that I 'm just wondering would that be a solution to look at or have you looked at it I owe you put one when we I know we 've gone over this a number of times and I apologize but bring it up again better I mean I said you know our view was that the four meter wide shear path was the best option and and while I only listened to part of it I I thought that was supported by clean Corey of spokes this morning and he did acknowledge that you know there 's pros cons pluses minuses for everything but you know my understanding of what he was saying as he did seem to think that was a reasonable option I think the segregated paths as you would have seen earlier on the week that does raise issues with the mature trees there it 's not something which is favored by the arborist so yeah but to put it bluntly there are all pretty good options what you 've got at the moment is a pretty poor option which is obviously not wide enough yeah but but what we are suggesting is was by bit of a nose maybe a little bit more the shared power 4 meters wide as the best one the segregated path is something which is which is definitely an option and that has benefits to it we are concerned about the impacts on the trees but it does have other other benefits but look it 's a fine balance yeah thank you right if there 's the end of visions what I 'd like to hear guys is what if any changes that you want egg just so that we can focus the debate on any changes that people want to make so here 's the ones i 'm assuming and tell me if I 've got wrong park on more how said the tenting you want to Ray said and the shared cycle way is there any proposed changes to that from anyone you have okay the Selwyn street parking yeah is there anything that I 've left off that list that people want to raise so I 'm here 's what I 'm taking from from what you 've said I 'm assuming that the park or more how said that you would like to debate and the tapping rail and that suggested improvements from the blind and from karina you think that 's covered and do that without us doing anything excellent the shared cycle way or other configuration sorry no no I 'm just trying to get the subject did anyone want to raise that or not yes so on street parking the suggestion of having the parking taken out so that in fact north salem street until would have to hide links but it is so i 've got those three topics we want to buy left your state list before we start on the topics yani toyline sorry timing timing is timing like what delaying it was something like to the traffic going through the hospital corner and decide just to facilitate this can I just okay is there any other before we get there is there any other things that people want to raise in relation to a raft of recommendations at the end of this if not sorry Monday 's already bring changes made as a result of the transportation which been quite yeah yeah totally got that so I 've got four issues if i start with the timing one yani i 'm assuming just so that i can make this a wee bit quicker than otherwise i 'm assuming that you would like to delay this or part of this can I just get a sense of if there 's going to be any traction for that around the table I 'm sensing not so it 's over it 's over to you whether you want to raise it or not it 's that can I go back to the top and the park so I 've now got three issues unless you want to raise timing yani no no no but you 're I ok so the park on morehouse air there is a suggestion from you guys that we leave it in for a period up to say March or April next year monitor it for safety and then report back to the council then it 's that acceptable I 'm just trying to save a whole part of debate especially sorry that pretty much i 'm seeing a lot of nodding ok so can I suggest that somebody would like to move that Tim would like to move it Pauline would like to see conduct and that so we leave it and in the meantime and bring back a report to Council on the safety of that by April 2015 and through you madam chair we also have some draft amendments to the resolutions at park ok let 's just get with another enterprise did you get that sorry Chris sorry so it was that the park in morehouse overset be retained in the mean in the meantime and staff monitor the safety impact of that and report back to council on it before April 2015 so wrap that what you would back from there that would probably have us right and report all must now make them visible Gary probably already late so persuadable as we can bump that out a little bit you absolutely may what would you like if we make it middle of the year june is that ok that 's fine who 's listening yeah I don 't think this thank you jun 2014 hola tricky day 25 more how said 45 park outside 45 more how save ok said ok with everyone can I put there those in favor please say aye those opposed carried right ok let 's start with that one um the shared cycle way through the park is there any change to what 's being proposed that anybody wants to note pop forward Yanni I want it redesigned so what 's the process of doing you can move an amendment what do you mean redesign based on the concerns that we 've heard from the different similars today I the whole concept of a shared pathway being a cycle way through heavy park and the impact on the trees really concerns me of a cycleway on the road side of hagley park rather than through so we went through this at the Environment Committee order some one-on-one long committee can 't remember which one it was and there was quite a lot of debate about that is is there going to be can I just get a sort of indication are people wanting to do that I 'm feeling like there is going to be support for the shared safer way with good signage and things through it I actually tried what what you 're suggesting at the Environment Committee there was no traction ok ok so the shared cycleways likely to go through right so that doesn 't require any amendments and these motions does it right thank you but so on street parking fill the suffix of how to leave it legally address there and this changes around 6.85 i think it is in the report so basically they refer to special it 's called vehicle lane but it 's a cycle lane ready for use of northbound bicycles and then that 's also there 's also a pet reference those changes so as this what you 're wanting to move yes I wouldn 't move I 'll move the report but in effect if council adopt adopt these I don 't think it will require an amendment what does it let 's see if I could just confirm staff position on this and so from our position because of the lack of a firm commitment to a cycleway sales of more house air and because their concern over the loss of car parks our view was that council probably shouldn 't proceed with the cyber layman you know on Selma street north but we realized it was finely balanced and we realized that councillors we 're off of you that it maybe it should go back in so we simply foreshadowed that and prepared some resolutions to help counsel in case that was their decision but from our viewer it was that the cycleway without something to the south of Morehouse F was not something that she 'll go on but that we simply prepared the resolutions to there was a deputation at your earlier meeting from one of to have that car park retained similar to the ones we 're here today so yeah okay so this is a possible change we haven 't actually moved the substantive motions I 've just been reminded so we can 't move amendments use on the Descent emotional okay so Phil would like to move the substantive motion and is there a seconder for that Ali would like to see conduct okay and so we 've we 've now we 've done the amendment shall we now do the amendment on the 45 more how self given that we 've now got a motion and that was moved and seconded at the time was that call it gives me madam chair for just raise one procedural in terms of the metamaterial I could just advise um accounts so just a bit of explanation on this what I 've done with 642 resolutions here and looking at this part as I 've done with many parts is revoked the whole north side of morehouse seven you between higley and so on now what I 've done is set up some alternative resolutions if you can get being tracked change at 6.5 to so put you on the spot I can just explain what we 're doing here to give the big clarity who you are you sure those two are going to go together we 've been but as we 're looking for it it 's just that what I originally have and the root and the substantive emotions there is that the whole the north side all parking restrictions be revoked I 've now changed need to say just provoke from he 'd leave I boy 55 meters east of higley ab the reason for there is then revoke that put back into that place some no stopping and a bus stop because bearing in mind this is going to be a it 's two to improve the bus stop facility at that point so then from that 55 meters on its we haven 't revoked anything so therefore we have moved the the new resolutions saying its status quo meaning that the bus stop sorry that the car park remains and that the no stopping at night for the boy cruising issue that 's a separate issue but everything remains status quo so so if we move the ones that you 've got here the staff recommendation plus the ones that you review that for safety so if we put that into these ones we get the impact of leaving the car pack that the guys were submitting on in place at the moment absolutely okay and you might say well what about down at the higley AV and well we certainly have consulted on that and we had no concerns about down a dead end and we buy what we had there for that 55 meters of curbside is improving the bus stop in regard to the new guidelines for bus stops okay so we put this plus the one that we had previously chris is that right add the mdh i 'll just make sure she 's got the right one going to 6.5 tea and yes that 's correct so that 's a new 6.52 and the track changes and over this side you can see we deleted the the the original right okay proposal i 'm does this does this so should we add to this the bit about you coming back in june having looked at the safety the bit that we just previously moved okay for the i think it 's in the substantive part of the motion so we probably got it there it 's already there okay and this achieves what you want to achieve is and leaves that one park the end right okay so it 's just to clarify if you look at page four of em raise and submission from Earth do this and if you 're looking at page four a single car park on what has eh we 've discussed and in moving back along towards the higley park there 's another building because he ripped it was representing the owners and operators from 25 to 50 one more house air so those car parks in front of the other two car sales yards on the other side of the large building that means that those car packs and not affected at all by what you 've just proposed not imagine if they are never we are those car parks are unaffected it 's only down at the very same is that nice fun dear here on the air I can 't do it it 's just modifying the bus stop at that point to provide good leader than leave okay so we are absolutely clear that what you 're suggesting here along with the one earlier amendment that we 've put leaves that one car park there and those other earlier two counts oh ok now what else did we have guys the shared cycleways sound like that pretty much they 're covered in the resolution aren 't they please madam chair if I can clarify that too there 's quite a number of track changes there and you may wonder why I 've got to change Trek change therefore the intersectional morehouse sell one you think well what 's that got to do with it the reason I put a trap change there and say sort of similar but let 's say I said originally as its detailed an attachment 1 and I 've seen now as as amended by council decision of today if or not revoked there in reworded it yes worth as a mentor by today didn 't you would have had two resolutions that conflicted one saying danger markings and quarter let 's go teach from one but you 've actually resolved to do something well actually we haven 't_''_966.78 resolved it well I know yeah so so let 's come to that this is the car parking versus a bike lane and part of someone straight rightful the northern part of so on street but there 's bike lane at the moment doesn 't continue down the street so that the argument just for those who would hear from the so you have all the information from the shopkeepers in that area was why would you put in half a cycle way given that you don 't have one further down the street why don 't you allow us to keep the car park in there for a period of the year or two until the cycleway goes in that was their argument and at the earlier thing the committee that was hearing that went with that argument my correct the sexy do what does the special vehicle lane is that a bike lane southbound bicycles what what I thinking to achieve is although tether the network doesn 't follow to the southern part of Selwyn street that would be the intention to extend the network when possible now my argument is if we delay this for a year in fact and we put parking in that 's it when as council being able to be brave enough to actually take your parking and I think this will be a brave decision but equally I think if we 're going to achieve a change in the modes of transport in our city we need to do this so in fact that will impact on the network it will mean that more people be on bikes again well achieve actually for your cars in the central city ok so this it 's just so everybody 's aware of what what fellas suggesting so this puts in a cycle lane on the moon one part is going straight ok pulling regarding the parking issue on the north side of cell and street illustrate the business is the little thing have parking off street behind the premises and things like that so you madam chair number of them do yes this was a specific submission on the first draft set of proposals which did include a northbound and southbound cycle lane on cell wind street I think again former bits on behalf of at least some of the submitters that were here before council this morning I think the quantum effect there of parking on selling street is 14 or 16 spaces that would be affected there as a consequence if council were to decide to install those cycle lanes there are no cycle lanes there at the moment pro clarification so it 's about 16 spaces we 're now discussing up that speaking for the submitters I think for my recollection from their submission on the draft plans there were similar arguments to what council heard this morning it but exhibited a lot of the business premises head I think have got off street parking and plasti was also the comment that a lot of those parts are being used by staff long-term parking so it might not be such a huge impact is perhaps the war how see if one would be that 's my feeling on it yeah I the business people were similarly motivated as this morning 's one when they came I 'm Paul mine sister this in a comment disfigured what felda said I have concerns around losing parking and I know there are issues when you do lose parking and around some of the small suburban areas which are like small weed convenience stores you have our lead people are drive to those and what a park outside so I just want to raise it we can 't just sort of Caliban say that part exactly yep no no he 's you 're fine just we 're in debate on this issue the seventh Street one yeah we 've asked the questions when going through particular issues so did you want to finish sorry Paul you got and drove it I 'll just like I just raised it as a kind of Concerned okay we do want to try and get people to shift the amount and it 's going to take some time to actually get a major shift and transport so in between that transitional phase or just could be very careful we don 't kill off businesses that actually us struggling some other moment and we want to make sure that people can still get to them on their usual form of transport which is the stage for the majority people as a cat yep Andrew and I 've got a question if I can for four staff the 16 14 to 16 car parks that you mentioned what 's the current time parting time restriction on those you madam chair I think we believe it about four of those spaces are p60 so in other words they 're servicing visitors to those premises rather than anyone that might be part they 're associated with those as best we understand in terms of the provision of parking on site with those premises that they 're probably already providing all that we would expect in terms I 'm just turning to a colleague here who knows more about the detail of that we are 's not the question yeah I mean information but it 's not the answer the question I asked so what I 've heard so far is that four of the spaces are limited to p16 and the remainder at the remainder are all under disappoint good slogans oh is it good it 's all unrestricted except for one pencil oh they 're all unrestricted so that suggests that when those car parks will put there they they won 't necessarily put there as high turnover parks to support those businesses even though that may be the way that they 're being used i would guess and it is only a guess that particularly from what we heard in one of the previous deputations that those parks have been used for the most part for all-day parking people walking into town people who are staff at various businesses and so on or the hospital even mailing that that may well be the case do we have any anecdotal comment on that or has no work being done around i only anecdotal in so much as we do know from the draw central city is certainly under a lot of pressure at the moment in terms of all day parking to service a number of premises in that area which of course has been exacerbated by the parking difficulties around the hospital and obviously counselors is supporting that with the the brewery site car park in the a zone with cdhb but there are genuine precious our parking in an area certainly all right thank you this valuable information Ellie just to clarify what phil was saying about the area that we 're looking at all he suggesting the removal of car parking there are you saying that there would not be a cycleway in the area where the car parks would be removed but there would be intention to complete the cycle way on that area in the future is a reason that if we can if we can put in the cycle cycle lanes now we counsel candace it can then have the potential possibilities of increase in the network to the southern part of of cell and street so it joins up with Eddington and the seventh street shops don 't if we decide not to there it would be little point of proceeding with extending that part of the network in my view so Ellie this actually takes the cup hacks away folks resolution takes the cut backs away and puts in a cycle lane were they view to in the future extending the cycleway and cell and street further and further along on the other so it 's just took Evan clarified that I just want to support what Paul has said as well I would be very concerned about doing that at the stage without a view complete at the other end I think if you are planning to do something like that you perhaps could look at reducing the car parking from all day car parking too restricted car parking so that people who are currently parking there all day can change their patterns you know i 'm all for cycling but we can 't_''_1499.35 be making these changes to the detriment of the people that we need to travel around our city and to work in that particular town so I can 't support that there was going to be an extension it was going to be done in a timely manner I would support it but without that I can 't can we just get that clarified when is that cycle way planned to go through the rest of it because the cycleways on the other two streets isn 't there my understanding is that in in the council 's outline program the the upgrading of salween street south of morehouse avenue which would then lead to the delivery of a cycle route there I don 't believe that 's within our programming for the next ten years ok ok I 've got yani was next then Pauline term and Dave so let me just say totally support having a really good cycleway going to the south the accessible transport plan puts it on integer straight some kind of puzzled why we 'd go and so on could we can we look at reducing the traffic on integ you a lightly accessible transport plan tells us in making that a major cycle way _"

    "text": "sit next tenant mr. mica item 32 is the one to watch a whole lot of delegations too uncommon to us you had a whole lot of delegations on this this morning and what I would suggest they were a range of issues covered and there have been a range of issues covered in the report here and then there are a huge number of colors Cassidy 's when you want to raise something that you tell us exactly what it is and when we first of all flag the issues that we want to discuss otherwise my hunch is on this one we could be here tomorrow and so if you want to raise something we saw allow you to answer asking questions about anything and then if you want to raise any question like for example the traffic and more out there or the cyber way and so on street or whatever it 's just flag what it is and will identify the issues that are up for debate before we go into a general debate okay are there any questions on this entry then Jimmy then ya start as on um so what extent is there work in these first phase transport projects which has a bearing on work that could happen in the second phase of an accessible City is there anything that we are deciding on today that would that we would decide differently if if phase two were not to proceed as planned um so in terms of the overall program for an accessible City there is a huge amount of work that 's anticipated to deliver the whole chapter if you like and certainly that 's something that we envisaged occurring over a number of years of council wherever mind to to approve it and fund it the first phase transport projects as you 're aware account for some seemingly odd million dollars and they have specifically been approved by council earlier on this year because they support key anchor projects will early projects so in terms of whether if the phases beyond that which are subject to what we call a business case project process through which we seek funding from Treasury in the crown of the phase is 2 3 4 proceed because they weren 't found it by the crown or by council these projects here would stand on their own merit two questions first one I 've reviewed a four point of 41 the page the 338 even the st. John you know have pointed out if the time is a critical so ambulance can travel if on the nose could assess the hospital soon released an Avenue us 2000s nation no any problem however my understanding the community of elderly people say to you know result less than a group they 're concerned if their ambulance path through the lincoln road a moment are hecka leader Avenue they can conduct joe carter to the hospital if go straight ahead to LA montreal in order to you turn to learn to strip then turn right to the hospital because ambulance we are all aware the patients probably is emergency case so where is the shortcut all those ambulance can form stalls to assess to the hospital through you madam chair we 've had further discussions with some john 's ambulance and the district help health board over those ambulance the southwest is slightly longer in distance but what these projects offer us is more journey reliability at those key intersections so for most of the journeys from John 's point of view those are more reliable journeys to and from the hospital so in if they would quite understandable concerns about the effects of these schemes on their ambulance response times but I think we 've satisfied them this overall package of proposals based upon the future increases in traffic to and from the central city are actually the best balance to in order for them to deliver their services endure because the you lose review the car ecstasy spatial either kinda of the separator rpd seen the facility in also the carriage inner city calif eula excellent is the when the motor vehicle left hand you know there was unaware the kitchen where have a closed in sh also highly furious kind of case so I 'm wondering in this that the kind of a new facility have any other kind of early state you know the kind of green light for cycle Easter I think for the for cyclists and improved cycle safety yes we believe it makes a significant contribution to cycle safety for the first time you have a controlled crossing of Morehouse Avenue to that key cycle route through the part which we understand is a matter for debate for council today and that links to the Little River cycle trail which is one of the early priorities as I understand it from counsel for the major cycle routes program so we do believe that offers a good level of amenity and safety improvement for cyclists and why we 're proposing as an early scheme for the program so just um given what we now know about the optimization of the roads that won 't be fixed and you know I 'm not sure you 've seen this math that we 've been given so you can see all the red is it stall your view that this should be a priority given our current financial constraints and given that we 've got levels of service on our roads that have you know have serious impacts if they 're not fixed in the short you but it 's a financial accessible accessible City is around betterment and and growth and the recovery of the central city around the redevelopment of it the repair and skirt program is a different issue and so art my answer to your question is yes I do believe it 's the right scheme come just just to say that there were a number of submitters it 's on on that point yeah the question has given the concerns that we 've heard about the designs and the concerns that have been raised around the traffic affects can you just is there a possibility that we could look at a new design that would try and deal worth this these concerns have been raised today and also possibly wait given that plan understanding as the second stage business case is likely to go through government probably by the end of the year so could we delay or defer this until we had certainty around the two hundred million dollars that 's currently not budgeted that goes into the transport plan so we know where the priorities are and to enable the concerns that have been expressed if I just make a brief comment into priority we did go through a prioritization process and we brought that back to Council and mahin Council approved that the reprioritized projects and as I mentioned earlier on there that are essentially there to support those early anchor projects so this one 's really you know that TP one going through Hospital corner that 's really there to ensure the buses can get to the interchange and they get gets the green wave that on its own doesn 't work an issue throttle off the traffic coming through from morehouse f 2 hagley f so that really makes it a lot more pleasant place and a lot less traffic going past the hospital itself enables the buses free movement as well it 's a bit of space for the pedestrian so I think we 've been through that and instantly the wide a bit of business case which has in draft at the moment and we want to report to council a nearly December has been through a process of going through every project that these ones that we 've got in there other priorities so we 're pretty comfortable from a technical perspective that we 've got that right as to whether they 're going to be funded that 's another question and as far as the design and the traffic effects are concerned our latest modeling for the area is indicating to us that without this package of changes before council today we would expect to see something in the region of 41,000 vehicles a day around Hospital corner in that area this package of proposals reduces that 28,000 vehicles a day so this is a significant reduction in the traffic pressures around Hospital corner and linked up of course with the avon river precinct and oxford terrace so without these proposals in the shape that they are we believe those key principles of anchor projects and the hospital redevelopment would not be able to go ahead to the same degree that we believe they now can thank you my questions about what seemed like a minor point for us but major for these crappie owners who came in before that deputation about to not have it that they 've offered a compromise monitoring that left turning lane until such times maybe yeah we 've had a bit of a chat about that and I think we do have a solution potentially which the council might like to consider we don 't necessarily agree with what they propose in terms of leaving that basically leaving the car parking space to the river and monitoring it some do you want to get kind of trouble perhaps so you madam chair we ought to explain a little more about why why we were proposing to remove that parking space there if it stays we 've only got about a twenty one meter left turn into cell in street there in a week 's time environment contra be will change their bus routes into and out of the central city and so that left turn will become a major bus turn into the central city and so our reason for seeking the removal of that parking space there is the likelihood of one left turning bus plus more than one vehicle at any given moment wishing more than one vehicle tagging along behind a bus and that could be one vehicle with a trailer on the back for instance the second vehicle would start to jut out into the head traffic lane and so we perfectly understand the submission this morning and why that 's a difficulty for those business owners there so our recommendation to cancel based on that submission this morning is that we monitor that the operation and the safety of the new intersection after the bus routes change for say three months and we report back to council in march or april of next year on a safety and an operational review of that plus the parking along that north side block between hagley Avenue and Selwyn street that I think if we just show people the information they come to their own conclusions themselves I just wanted to make sure and be clear 4.12 page 3 33 that relates to all of the issues and concerns that people have had about the emergency vehicles particularly some John and the hospital right down to the number of seconds that are increased with mean it is very difficult for us to be absolutely precise about journey times in fact that 's pretty indicative yeah thank you her deputation referred to need safer people are visually impaired for some tapping rails I think she called them as well can they still be included on the plane through you madam chair yes absolutely and there is no problem at all in including those in the designs for Hospital corner and as the blind foundation would request them at other crossing points there in fact councils just introduced that very arrangement just down in south city mall the street that comes off down one Street south happened in last week so there is a tapping rail there with that tactile paving so that that that 's part of our thanks to and my other question really relates to the submission boy hands off Hagley where they suggested that in fact the cycle lane be adjacent to the street too heavy Avenue and I know in the memorandum what you 've seemed to like all councillors you besides the address report you 've referred to some some the part might be I just wonder if you could perhaps explain the advantages and disadvantage of those options but madam chair just in terms of counselors may not all have that memo in front of them but I do have a basically a handout which does have his photographs of what the that she had path might look like if you 'd like me to circulate that to councillors muskoka what seen ya got up yep okay um sorry didn 't bring it like this through you madam chair as like the memorandum discusses it looked at three forms of achieving that level of shared use of a pathway there so that was a four meter wide unser gregation path then a for me to wipe are segregated by line effectively between cyclists and pedestrians and then the third option which is the subject also of the arborist report you 'll note was the idea of an overall a six meter wide facility but separated by one meter grass verge between separate cycle and pedestrian paths officers recommendations were the unsecured gated facility and within the memorandum and the signing and control arrangements that might achieve the behaviors that we would wish for there and were outlined by dr. Corey this morning on behalf of spokes and they were really measures around guiding people to to good behavior to stay left on the path to leave the path when you 're pausing which of course is what all council vehicles do for instance when they 're there to guide speeds there and that 's been that 's been developed by nelson city council recently around the use of their shared pathways so our overall view as officers is that we believe an unsecured gregation facility probably offers the best balance of advantage in in delivering a shared path they 're compatible with the unique path environment it doesn 't require as much signing and marking but so our approach there is to recommend those behaviors there and so does that answer that the cycleway be adjacent to the to the road you 're not you know you know we don 't favor that and in fact get right back to the accessible City document that was quite clear that route they 're not within the roadway thank you I don 't recall ever discussing the suggestion that we actually use the footpath is the cycle way that was suggested this morning and then use the park requires the walkway because I know that we didn 't use the roadway because we 've got into trouble down towards Rickerson II didn 't answer yes I think one of the key things if we were to use the footpath so I 've counseled whatever mind to to approve it and we had angled parking nix the the netball courts which were obviously increase the number of parking there the consumer would be the conflict between people hopping out of their car and cyclists going down that footpath if that 's what you 're referring to so that there is potential greater potential for conflict so that would raise safety issues for us and that wouldn 't be something that we 'd recommend yes mine 's a double-barrel question so the first question will lead into the second question so the first question is we 're shutting down a major vehicular access too if you drop off the traffic around Hospital corner with that in mind that 's going to push traffic out into them Adam to the heirs we 've got the eastern side which is having some roads shut down into the central city and I just want to know the long-term aspiration of the planning department on are you planning on also shutting down axios roots of BEF further exeis roots of morehouse f to restrict that traffic flow and into the central city see you madam chair the the plan contains proposals to improve the efficiency of the avenues so they 're in a better state to be fit for purpose to carry the strategic traffic around the outside of the central city they are the highest functioning roads in the central city and so the program business case which which is just referred to is variously looking at what stage we would then need to address further enhancements to the efficiency of the avenues now in broad order that would be about just as with the Hadley linker morehouse intersection greater use of the main distributor streets other words focusing the traffic efficiency and signals at those and potential measures within those therefore to actually discourage traffic usage in and out of town by the less function streets is ago in the central city so at the time that we got to those further measures within hopefully further phases of this work then at that time that would be the stage for us to consult in detail just as we have done over those individual changes but that is the broad strategy to make best use of the avenues for efficient traffic movements and to then direct traffic into and out of the central city by the main distributors which of the blue streets I take it in you will be looking at closing off more three so not not closing but we we may well be looking at efficiency enhancements at individual intersections yes okay the next question is is that you 're talking about these massive increase of traffic by the year twenty forty one will the ABS cope because they 're not actually coping that well at the moment we 'll way she cope for the private motor vehicle and are you looking at applying the same rules as you 're applying to the central city which is a key activity centered two other key activity centers this a cricket and road for example say where major traffic positions on this I 'm just trying to see where the future holds for traffic in the city well this will the more hair sale in be liev a begginer better sultania tackling Morehouse Avenue obviously part of it through this scheme there is another project in the first phase program and that is for the enhancement of Fitzgerald Avenue at the Twin Bridges there so that is an enhancement to the capacity of that intersection there and also in reintroduces the right turn there from the north into kilmore street for buses and the overall plan for bus movements in the central city is completely linked with corridors such as riccarton where it is dovetailed in with the idea of the the corridor in from the West being a priority route for buses in from the west so the central city traffic plan very much approved some 18 months ago and so these proposals you have before you today are completely consistent with that plan and as far as this particular project the Hagley Lincoln morehouse is concerned that is also dovetailed in with our corridor study for lincoln road we had huge traffic problems as everyone 's aware through addington and so this is the bottleneck on the addington road lincoln road corridor and so whatever we do further south down halls well road and lincoln road it does various lead of turtle in with our need to deal with this very complex intersection at the northern end I think in a nutshell you can make improvements the efficiency of the avenues without closing off access to the central city pool if that 's what you 're worried about because so there 's stuff we can do in there to make those under Sections operate more efficiently to get more traffic through them and it 's not about closing off roads to the central city that 's great my concern is accessible City rather inaccessible say it it 's a tailor-made solution for this proposing to reduce it to three all the others may be different the solutions to those may be very different and this as Tim said it 's tailor-made for this one and and you know that that hagley more house under section at the moment is not a very pleasant one to go through it 's it 's not a nice experience and I wouldn 't say it 's the safest one that we 've got in the city at all so just will improve the safety of it so but it 's specific to that one and I wouldn 't expect that to necessarily be rolled out anywhere else and just just a finish on that it 's the fifth most congested intersection citywide at the moment with these proposals even with the projected increase in traffic flows there we lift that right out of the top ten intersections it drops to about 16th or 17th in the list so this is a significant improvement to its efficiency raid was representing the owners and operators of 23 the 51 more served a single car pack you 've come up 'm very much supportive of keeping its I know how this can affect a business not having that type of carpe the especially a car sales with people expected we jumped on and dumb arraigned I 've got an idea as well but I 've taught both of you after afterwards or at some convenient time about that so I 'm not wasting everybody 's time this question second one is armed _"

    "text": "water supply wastewater and stormwater by law though water supply wastewater and stormwater by law which principally applied to the peninsula more so than anywhere else where there was a requirement to have stormwater collection and what prompted a lot of discussion was Brendan water sorry yeah what what problems a lot of discussion was really the interpretation of the word of redevelopment where we had a number of businesses and some private property that were in some instances rebuilt after the earthquakes and they didn 't have provision on-site one or two of them to actually incorporate the rain water supply tanks so there was a redefinition of redevelopment which basically said if they were building on exactly the same footprint they would be exempt from that regulation it was just going to be impossible for one or two to two actually comply so the rest of it i think was relatively self-explanatory that was the major bit of working with that bottle okay glen and then we 'll take that thanks for Vicki I think it 's more is an explanatory note which says it 's not part the lines of dispensation exists so if you wish to rebuild on your existing footprint but by law does apply but there are some just better to limit you dear okay okay yeah an import thank you I just want to be clear um I think you 've I don 't know if you 've seen the hole opened up in that Israel so quite a big hole opened up in the middle to ride and one of the issues is of course a lot of private properties having it is quite image and not being repaired you know taking a while and so in the meantime while the storm water is going into those properties and in under running properly maybe under the road on to neighboring properties my understanding previously to that spiral is that is by Lord to not give counsel any right to require people to keep storm water in a reasonable standard that mitigates the effects on neighbors or on public property when this was drafted and came to council I asked if it would capture that can you just reconfirm that this Bible gives the storm water systems are not adequate to deal with the stormwater the can 't talk about of course are specific circumstances but but in a general sense yes the purpose of the bylaw recognized in particular change circumstances after that after the earthquakes and that the for example in certain circumstances the Resource Management Act or other requirements wouldn 't be sufficient so it specifically says that this bylaw is in addition to controls on stormwater and posed by the region Council and and the City Council under the Resource Management Act building Act and other xfit relations and bylaws that 's on page 2 98 for stormwater and on on section 37 we looking at with the relevant that part of the bylaw for stormwater is part 3 storm water which can which starts on page 2 98 yes yes certain can you just tell me also if there 's damage by storm water being caused to other what we gonna to the council system then those powers under their life government 2002 in relation to damage to council infrastructure so in terms of how we enforce that says hey worried about neighbor 's property my you know still waters coming onto my property doesn 't look in good shape in terms of the page for which is a fence and penalty do do we have the ability to take action other than just fine or did we consider actually sending a letter to remedy or doing the work ourselves and then below can we can we do that there are various powers are thought govern 894 bit possibly is also an issue like that with adverse effects from one neighbor on to another might be a resource management at issue as well that steps could be taken under so there are other powers besides measures in the Bible that but what does be a breeze I I guess what I 'm trying to understand I really support the bylaw but in terms of the ability to address the issue that 's causing concern how we you know what powers we have given that we 've got huge holes opening up and roads and the hills which is obviously really concerning and we don 't want to happen measures particularly when you think about the lean mass movement areas in lightly others these powers plus the powers under the local government act and yannis question is apart from sending these people were fine can we do something to actually remedy the situation the council could potentially takes people something they might be if it 's considered to be an issue in terms of building eat issues then there 're it might be that you can issue a notice to fax if there 's something that 's okay life is a problem that 's not likely been building it definitely to advance favorite causes no no just a minute Yanni I 've got David n and Peter competing to answer and you can face with us if its private to private it 's common law and basically going you 've got no power by legislation we understand that yannis concern of this if its private with a public impact on say the road you have got that pack okay but you can do it if have to end the novel 's now you can 't do private if it under the Resource Management Act that could be exercised that situation help us by login as well as by the local government allowed you I just want to be clear because the private property my reading of the Bible that people on their own property have to kick their storm water and a they have maintenance responsibilities so I 'm not sure it is just a civil matter I would have thought that this bible does give us power where people aren 't keeping storm water in a certain condition to to intervene what you 'd look at the particular facts of the situation work out whether it 's more and a civil issue that should be left to be dealt with by the owners or whether it is something that council should intervene on so that 's but hard to give an answer in terms of you know where that is for some exceed effect but to cause a license having a storage of tent work rain water retention on a property does that actually mitigate some of the flooding issues we get an extreme weather events now the should we not be thinking that in flood management areas and semi rural areas where you know we have a number of runoff and it does create quite a bit of flooding would not let make sense to exia and prevent that sort of the the supplementary water storage rainwater tanks is is for water supply purposes the sort of flood retention tanks that are required of a different order they are apparently being required already on hill slopes and in some areas the they 're much bigger and of course the idea is that they will have get water out as rather than keep it in so that they 're empty when the food arrives so my understanding is from our technical people is that there may be a marginal the the small supplementary water storage tank might be marginal assistance but in in terms of real flood mitigation no that 's okay but those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you and I 'm supposed to move a resolution that the supplementary reports be included in the council _"

make a deputation okay so mr. jairam you 'll be aware that you 10 minutes to speak with us including Christian time so do you like would like to allow it I particular issue but I 'm heavily at point yeah well the situation is that we understand that was a degree of urgency to make a decision on the bus lounge and rekelen and what we wanted to do is just address the council regarding that agency because we think that we need more time and so what would we don 't want us to for this decision to go to the Environment Committee and try to get this all cleaned up by the end of the year you know we 're aware that there 's still some unresolved issues regarding the bus lounge in particular we 've been in touch with Westfield 's and they are quite keen to go back to the negotiating table in order to get a resolution on the bus lane where it currently exists and which was the second proposal and the other thing is that we understand that the current proposal which is on the corner of diva and the diva building on the corner of division street and record and road that the building is not up to earthquake code and because of in the cost we found out late last night that they it might not be a viable option and that a new site or the original site is now being negotiated by the council staff and so that it is going to go back to JK k that 's the preview there 's what we call the building so we don 't feel that this can be resolved especially before Christmas yeah mr. chairman the the view of the residents association of course is that we 're very concerned about this proposal but we would support Paul 's comments that it is a matter of some considerable importance and we believe that it 's a matter of the council as a whole should be considering rather than leaving it to an environment subcommittee so to speak but would be happy to make submissions in due course to which of a body of the council is going to resolve the issue thank you so are there any questions from councillors yanny um yeah do you have any comment on whether it should be till I get it to the committee which council you did that yeah so is the reputation of the world quite clear that their preferred that what they would like inter seeking is that the decision actually be made by the full council yes my grits right so that 's the answers but I just in terms of a recommendation from the board to the committee to counsel or you happy for it just to go straight to counsel from the community board are we having for her to go straight to the council okay we can consider the process but you 'll you 'll be aware to that the Watson the report is that in fact the community board be involved by a way of being able to make a recommendation and that they be fully involved in the processes so poor in the engineer I 'm just as interested in the conversation with whiskey of it you guys had because we 've been given quite clear steer they weren 't interested in actually year during business isn 't with us on having a transport exchange on that that piece of land we a colleague of Mines him last week and he got in touch with westfields in Auckland on Friday to see if there was any room or whether they prepared to negotiate and they said you 'd know that quite happy to come back to the negotiating table with regarding resolving the bus stop outside record and more so you know they they they had place your question though Paul I 've just we 've gone through this here about we notice that this stage though into the deputation in terms of standing orders it needs to be a question sorry okay Jimmy Kimmel okay the quiz is a witness in can we get that in writing yes second-biggest okay thank you Jimmy I think a check when you make the deputation to the council a start did you gather any reprieve from start when will ever kind of the formal response or have a whaler have a candle hearing on that I could do we have we had any response from the staff it 's been mixed the initial proposal that we did get was flawed and it was very misleading it was the with the staff to see if there 's been any approach by the council to resolve any of our current problems you know regarding air pollution noise pollution the parking we 've had no feedback yet from the council staff and I 've been endeavouring to get information as to what 's actually happening with the current site you know we endeavoured to find out whether the council were in fact going to be paying for the upgrade of the building to bring it up to earthquake standards with you know from business point of view we feel that that 's basically the landlord 's responsibility and not the council 's but I haven 't been able to get clarification from the council staff as to whether that is actually happening and as to regarding the location of the new site I have had no luck this morning and getting an opinion as to what site is actually on the agenda thank you can i point out though those issues aren 't we in relation to the decision we 're making today today is a really only about in relation and a decision making there was another question there 's no physics are ii i 'm david probably just really one of a clarification over the West field site are you telling us that Westfield happy to renegotiate that site that site alone with no other strings attached as to what may happen to other pockets of land around the other that which has been the stalling point in previous negotiations so no I can 't give an assurance that that although prepared to does come back to the negotiating table there 's no further questions counselors okay thank you for your deputation and will now consider the the the item thank you thank you so counselors are the recommendations if it would be good if staff now join us perhaps to explain their position and might be some other comment from staff exerts univ elip as counselors aware the delegation was previously given by counsel to the the Environmental Committee and the advice was that because there 's a new committee the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee this mechanism is necessary to to roll that delegation over to the of meetings planned with the committee in the community board jointly to take this through to December starting next week with a joint briefing and then a community board meeting on the twenty fifth of November and then coming through to the environment the ite committee on the fourth of december so there 's quite a comprehensive process in place today is really about confirming the previous delegation to the committee from Council which is the purpose of this paper thanks Richard can I just clarify with you to one of the retort the recommendations in the report pertained the need for the timeliness around the decision making and that in fact was time constraints I 'm just wondering in fact if F in fact count council were to meet before the end of the year and to sort make these decisions in fact if in terms of the overall timing for it to be or prefer via and started before April next year if in fact that will allow counsel sufficient time if council met before Christmas that would okay so in that sense if the delegation relation to that would still be workable yeah we 're still working back from the opening of the new central interchange in April so we 're still working back from that day but if the council met before rape before Christmas that we think thanks such a question so Andrew and then thank you and timeliness is clearly one of the big considerations in this and on the face of it what we mean has to make is a simple procedural decision but of course because of the level of public interest and the the timeline restrictions it 's become a wider discussion than that there are and a couple of things that were raised in the deputation that I 'd like to get a staff view on if I can the the suggestion that Westfield are happy to reopen negotiations the suggestion that the proposed site is not up to earthquake code and those alternatives are being considered can I get some staff comment on that because clearly we 've heard that from vexation I think in terms of making this decision around timelines it 's important that we 've got or may not in fact be happening yes with wytheville draw would always be open to reopening negotiations as no doubt in our mind as staff on there but there 's there was some issues with as counselors have been briefed on with those negotiations that just didn 't work for us it 's Council so I mean there 's no doubt in my mind that Westfield will always be open between because because of their interest another council land this quest with quake strengthening is the landlord 's responsibility not not councils there is however issues around council buildings public buildings requiring a higher earthquake standard what was the other question counselor of so the third question leads on from that whether as a result of the requirement for additional earthquake strengthening to the proposed building whether other alternatives will be hard yes a the says no decision on there we 're still looking at at this current building and our briefing next week we 'll explore all those issues yeah what the new transport interchange opening in April next year hmm and the issues around because of my where that would be the ideal outcome could we still operate the current status quo in there with the newly transferred unchanged would there be any issues with doing that if we so decided to issue hold off and see if we can resolve something with lions think it just it just gives a really poor service for for passengers because we 'll be a higher frequency on Richmond Road and it 's the outbound passengers that have to join a as part of the hubs and spokes and model the Environment Canterbury model so passengers would be waiting in awful facilities or almost no facilities to make connecting to make connecting bus trips so so the the in terms of the central interchange it 's just that really poor level of service for passengers on the on the end and that 's not so important I think the other issue that it 's that 's very poor crossing facilities at that location I agree the whole river road associate pool situation for any get across but particularly at Westfield issues first one your particular mention you know district and of the major significance status and also the other one is written code or public transport as per our project is also Todd or net I 'm concerned at least a timeframe timeline first one my understanding the publication of the consultation the expiry date has been the under 28 all told so up to now almost almost of more than two weeks what is the staff nanosys comprehensive report when the council can be received this year report yep so there will be fair to be finished on the the council analysis of that information is being done now closed on the twenty-eighth of October that comes to council on the it comes to the the infrastructure transport Environment Committee is a briefing on the 19th next week with the community board and it also comes to the environmental the infrastructure transport Environment Committee on the fourth of December all that information that 's just on that that 's just on the lounge on the public transport lounge that all that consultation so following their consultation obviously there will be council staff will look at that and see what you asked was about the corridor priority for ribbon road so again their information will come to the ite committee on the fourth of the sender for consideration of consulting on there which won 't be until the new year so that will be early new year 2015 that the priority corridor priority will be consulted on slo-mo particular concern Eva these are two facility are all be done to part of metropolitan significant status if we go ahead one of them the other one not yet you know have a consultation until next year so whether you know can make and you know to comply with the time schedule this might but you can say another one regarding to the combine joined a infrastructure in the environment committee as well as communities meet its open or close the the the briefing next week is is is called is public excluded next week 's briefing but the the committee meeting on the fourth of the zimbra is open justjust your point about the tooth to two issues yes they do a mish together and in terms of priority for the on the roads such as the intersection of Dean 's even written road where the current roundabout is so the proposer will be to signalize that intersection so there 's those sort of structural changes that it will come about as a result of the route priority presence tell you we pray to the concert eterna regarding to a more moist air in order continue to negotiate with the kind always feel more essential if we go hey the first apart if after later you know eventually agreed so how to alleviate or remediated is the situation but i 'm not sure what Coach the question but to be fair we 've done with field two days we renegotiated within four months and months and there are reasonable limits on staff time I 've got a speaking order and that is Ellie Indian Yanni so he nan said Danny yeah thanks um I just was a little bit unclear from the recommendations what 's going to Community Board and then to the committee and then what 's going to straight to the committee so yes am i right and thinking will recommendation to the committee it 's a final sign-off and others are just going straight to the committee yes is this correct so can you just help me understand things are a so so so the joint briefing on the 19th of November is everything that 's the that 's the joint briefing to the committee and the in the community board yeah and then on the 25th or November yeah there 's a report to the community board regarding the on street bus stops the on street changes and that is a partay item recommendation to the Committee on the fourth of December so so you 're correcting your and then your question the waiting lounge isn 't going to to the community board is going straight to the Committee on the fourth of the cinema so it wouldn 't it be better to have those two things linked because if the community would say no we 're not going to move the bus stops doesn 't that impact on though well that 's that 's then for the committee to make their core so if we wanted moving in ammendment to have it come to counsel what is the wording that that we need and so it seems to me that the only thing we really need to change is just putting those two projects together go into the community board going to the committee and then coming to counsel well I was going to actually in relation to me was going to check with the staff if in fact it would be more workable to that because of the public interest and the the hub waiting lounge and then in the cheapest top if in fact that came to counsel but that given the different decisions that are going to be required around the priority lanes but for public transport that in fact that remain as recommended deal with the committee just I just wonder if that ever start head of you on there please well both I mean both that would work I 'd be in terms of hearings it was there that people will want to make submissions they would have to go to the committee and the in the committee would have to 're talking about now but prior the the the prior delegation from the council meeting of the twenty sixth of June gave gave that authority to the committee to head to have a hearing and make a decision oh okay I just wanted to check that the second question I had was around the hubs and spokes model so if that model changes as is this level of investment still warranted because you know I know the hub 's its most models kind of an ideology yeah and a lot of it 's jaron post-earthquake the need to kind of respond to the financial situation that long term if we get you know having people on buses not having to transfer all the time is for their my own sensible approach then what what does projects don 't ever need he said would the what won 't change is the high frequency bus routes in reckon road is one of our high frequency bus routes the same will be for pepper new road so what what won 't change in this whole bus priority is identifying those key corridors for frequency bus routes they 'll always be local service that will spin off from those but the whole thrust is for is for you know faster quicker more convenient safer and better better facilities for passengers who currently have to wait in very substandard conditions and crossing the road as Phillip cedar Zealand difficult thanks I should question from Paul and then I think we should wrap up the questions counts not some clarification I have the spoke mmm it is my understanding that the new transport interchange in the city is designed as a hub and spoke design cannot be changed in the future so there is no way around if a bespoke modeled fails it has the other thing you want because the design of a new transport and change is a hub-and-spoke body so I can I can 't answer if if the new interchange can 't_''_1480.29 can 't_''_1480.86 be altered but it was predicated going right right back to have your say after the earthquakes where people didn 't want the central city full of buses they wanted fewer buses in the central city so it of there quickly on high frequency roots coming into the city but but no I couldn 't I couldn 't say where there couldn 't be changed in the future thanks Richard councillors into the discussion I 'm going to propose an amendment following the questions and discussion and that 's particularly in relation to 6.2 and so that we fear that we delete the terms infrastructure transport and Environment Committee and you know it 's because of tight timelines to and just insert the word Council it 's in fact that the final decision on the public trends would have waiting lounges made by counsel it seems it would fit the timeline the other the other recommendations though I 'm going to strongly suggest that they still remain there 's a lot of fine tuning to be done around the record and priority lanes and the counselors will recall that the whole reason we set up new committees was so that decisions could be made in a timely fashion and it just seems to me this is the most workable I think it 's a very good point that happy to serve their amendment but no through the ones but um that 's open to discussion Jimmy chin and then Andrew q cheer but regarding the sequence of facility Rixon were cold or patron transport as per our de project even go to the dedicated our committee but I 'm concerned whether counsel all a counselor my head for you know to have four digs a workshop essential because up to now looks like we only aware the first of facility wait energy we have no any idea you got into a public transpo bus priority project fellow can put in here yes except Jimmy there 's been a succession of meetings of council meetings to wear all of this has actually been discussed I 've got the timeline in front of me starting from you know well well back at the beginning of this councils two and they 've been there 's been a lot of recent information has come to and of course other counselors will be welcome to come to the height committee I just you know I mean the second ones rather than in first you referring to out 26.2 Jimmy or which one you 're referring to the recommendations on page 47 3 which we 're now discussing it 's a six-point of three yes it 's not a 6.2 6.3 and you 're ready asking in then you have to counsel to and I 've just given a quick tried to give a quick response well in fact there 's already been a lot of information but you have a vote on there so I 've got Andrew I think its meaning we remember the background to all this mean this actually came to counsel in a different form in December 2013 so almost a year ago it 's been around for some time and it 's it 's been debated quite thoroughly and a number of different options have been put on the table and I 'm sure there are some technical considerations and lots of other work that are not aware of in as much as I haven 't_''_1702.43 been involved in the work of this particular committee but so that there is a need for speed around this we do with the work I think it 's important that we keep the debate today around the decision which we 're making today which is in fact the process that this is going to go through for this final decision making there 's clearly some public interest a large amount of public interest clearly there 's some some time pressure around this as well I 'm certainly supportive of the amended resolution that 's been put up there i think if we can bring this back to council that recognizes both the need to do this in a timely fashion but also recognizes the the wider Metropolitan Public Interest that we 're seeing in this as well whilst there are some other issues that we could be debating around the hubs and spokes model and public transport in general I think it 's important that we keep the debate today to just this issue but that we make sure that what we do as part of that final decision when the report comes back is its future proofed in that way now I just wanted to also make some comments around actually got in clause I think it 's some six points too yeah the council delegate the decision to the council I think we probably just need to redraft that the council agree that it be the decision maker or something of that nature just so that it reads a little bit better so a little bit of wordsmithing going on there but i think it just would make it clear yeah council retain the decision great thank you to rescind the previous council decision before we for clarity so and are you suggesting that we just refer the delegation how do you I 'm just what are you suggesting can we get your advice on that to Peter the cancer has made the point that in fact if at the moment we 're asking Council to sin it had refer the delegation to counsel i enjoy really yeah so it 's just how it 's just how we should within yeah so if we just add the word that that 's it we 're home and dry dumb yep so we leave those words in because of tight timeframes two tunas hippie to second and over Yanni and then Paul to find out what the cost of that financial delegation is so how much money is on budget for that priority project is it currently funded and if so how much it 's it 's part of the crown funding agreement and the sheet costs of 91 million dollars for the central interchange the super Stop central city priority on riccarton road public transport hubs at northlands in riccarton that 's part of that 91 Kashia speech project has a financial component yeah I 'm just unclear about how much money we 're dealer getting away to the committee to go and spend yeah we don 't have the final price on the corridor yet that is coming you gently okay so I mean I find it really hard to delegate away a decision without knowing that how much the quantum is I also understand that this is actually serious project so I still have no idea why we 're doing all the work paying for all the engagement when in the cost share this is like ties into etc as it inversions that those other priority projects will also be delegated to the committee or we 'll get further reports on or are they just being done separately I 'm ya know these are in relation to urge what to us to stick to what end return is in relation to focusing on the delegation otherwise I think we can get very mixed up and like these these delegations clearly refer to the record and hub into the into the bus priority lanes yeah well sure what else you want well if you look at 3.2 what I 'm considering i went to the president that their seats for all the other priority roads if we delegate it to the committee I think these i would say these delegations are very specific to these routes mmm ok so I don 't look I makes you struggling with us focus not to be to fear not you know and i 'll say right look we 've got a mess of opportunity for the change the way we do air transport under changes in our hubs we 've got major forced into not so as they planned into issue complying and if you 're supporting the transport options within the city through a district plan we could actually put in rules it will actually enable us to acquire the land off westfield put in a transport interchange and have it fully integrated and we could do this right across the city this is a poor chasm to what we should be having and i just i am really struggling with unless this really one of my sites that 's to me it 's a problem it 's just a short-term band-aid on what is a wider issue we 're going to be dealing with right across the city and now 's the time while we 're actually fixing our city and actually building a better future and a better transport option for the public of Christchurch which we want to actually get out of the motor cars and under public transport this as I say I don 't believe it is actually the answer you know and I 'm going to struggle them I 'm now supported is the recommendation significant status consists of the facility for the reclaim public transpo hot superstar in the waiting knowledge as well as victim to a corridor public transport as per our profit by the the project also my understanding when we have a discussion even the Pew is the item verse 32 regard into a sensible City the intersection of the kind of the heck you later avenue and the more house avenue this one is a whole package if we go ahead you know like the 6.3 if a dedicated to our committee how about the other this part of package is still the note to learn council this my particular cancer the other one may concern is a moment if we reveal the structure of the infrastructure and the environment committee a moment we have only five with the chair together only five the counselors and also the counselor weekly partner he to declare this is kind of interest you know only for but we compared to the 12 even with the mayor 13 ler cancerous we only fought in Oh Teddy K make a decision how about the other to review is a holic holistic away review rather than these two theta kappa the other facility also part of between the central city to the victim area there 's part of the pack ad packaging so this my concern I cannot support can I just make some points just in concluding and somebody else might like to as well but um I think we should finish the debate but what what I think is important to realize is this council in the last previous committee have worked on this issue for a whole year now I don 't believe we can continue to delay and delay and delay in relation to the idea that in fact this is a poor choice I have to say that in terms of safety the clear the clear staff reports that are quite emphatic that in fact the current pation has got considerable advantages in terms of safety and we have to keep that in mind I think it 's quite clear that that I 'm Westfield and ever going to come to the party only on their terms and and so in in the interests of the people who catch the buses every day so I think it 's important that in fact we we support these delegations that the community board are fully involved and are able to continue to make recommendations and join in all briefings as word all councillors so I urge you to support that be the change in 62 and I 'm happy to move them separately then yeah okay yeah and there any other final comment particularly from aunt world 's getting hadn 't spoken so in the infield review to simply by process really I think just given thee well I you know ideally that committee move was the one we wanted to make just given the gravity and the contentiousness of the decision I supported the whole council are bearing the load of it I think if it was just on for on this in this particular case wouldn 't be good but i think if we will ya take ownership for it yeah just in relations well no I just wanted to move amendment 46.3 that it be delegated to counsel the decision amendment the truth let 's it 's great and Jimmy 's second deter now I just speak to it um well I I think working at our public transport priority lines are really important IM concerned though that this is a project that previously council had on budget we took it off budget because of concerns around it it is a contentious project and i do think it 's important that the full council takes ownership of making the decisions around it given the impact the significant impact it has citywide i 'm also concerned that on their environment and infrastructure and transport committee actually you 've got two counselors from the work and reward on it so you know if you think of a committee of five well Vicky 's are you not on it okay so sorry withdrawal that but it just seems to me that is just having such a small number of councils make such a significant decision when we feed from the community they want the full council to take the decision on this and I think you know I do think we need to priority projects in terms of PT because this was put into the cost share but this wasn 't consulted without community in terms of being a priority in fact previous consultations council had removed it because of the impact that it would have so I think we need to do it I can 't see any rationale behind saying because of tight timeframes the reality is that this process is going to take several months at least because we 'll have to go through hearings will have to engage with the community so I can 't see why it should be treated any different or the other agent things we have okay yet because I why the lease is wavy that will be the crucial because based on the staff will reply you know if the six pounders three they steer you know go to the kind of law here we 'll go to the consultation a situa I don 't think so you know that the kind of that time frame is tight is the excuse because if it is necessarily council we can have a kind of additional up to now I receive the 11 the kind of the email or a post this one so we need to make the disperses you know more open transparent and more more kind of the reasonable otherwise my personal view you know if we call hater but still quite a few people know make a complaint I don 't think so there 's a kind of smarter way I don 't think so yeah so I urge you to cancel please consider either support the amendment six ponder three Thank You Jimmy I 'm going to speak briefly against the amendment and basically the the committee 's are open it 's an open transparent process I 'm totally against having every sort of part of in terms of creating bus priority lanes parks and and the other infrastructure that will be required to be considered just really litigated at every council meeting so it seems to me what that 's why I am strongly opposed to to the amendment and I 'm supporting them 6.2 with that in mind I 'll now put the amendment which is at the bottom tuned so that council it 's at the top ok so it 's understood okay I 'll now put the amendment those in favor anyone against know she 'll have it will have a vote a can we use the voting system I 'll put the voting again as it looks it up to go so if you 're in favor of the amendment you vote Yes and if you 're against that you 'd vote no wife enrolling I voted wrong we have personal pattern we do that it is can we do doing it come around again can we just do it again so we 're doing the second electronic vote now so of the clear the amendment lost I 'll now put the other recommendations we have an electronic vote on them to all together do councillors want to put all together now given that the amendments me lost that 's I 'm sure it will be so if councillors look at 6.3 it so that the decision is actually delegated to our committee and we 'll have a vote on that so come with me electronic sorry if you support the recommendation your vote yes the subject this is protecting on 6.3 because it 's been asked for a separate vote on that so if you support the decision being made by the committee your vote yes if your kids stated by so I 'll do clear 6.3 carried I will now put the other recommendations all together music an electronic vote agin so if you support the other recommendations you devote years if you again sir you don 't know I 'll declare those recommendations or carried thank you very much to the staff for attending this matter in terms of getting things done quickly it 's been very important I think councils it 's now quarter to one and there 's been a suggestion from Vicki that we that we have a lunch break but that we come back for the council meeting at one-thirty so June the council meeting now _"

    "text": "item number 27 no 27 is the parks and reserves by law and to a degree there are some links also with the traffic and parking by law as well so close two point four outlines the the changes to the previous by law and we have include included a new floors relating to hagley park and I 'll come back to that in a moment there are men months to Clause 9 with the respective vehicles and parking reserves a deletion heart deletion and the clause and respect of scattering of burial of ashes and an amendment to this same sort of area as well I think just with the Hagley Park side of things we had a number of submissions on hagley park and most of them related to trying to incorporate a reference back to the management plan for the for hagley park and I think if I could just flick you over to page 223 the next one in close 5.3 we sought some legal advice on this matter and in the second half of that paragraphs of concludes that a reserve management plan does not be given the status of this Nick necessarily equal to a bylaw management plan is essentially a guidance or a policy document that God 's decision making in relation to reserves in comparison case law suggests bylaws are a tool to enable the council to govern public conduct and rules and sanctions there 's a difference as a result of that piece of advice we decided not to recommend any changes in the traffic and parking amendments by law and the similar sort of thing came across into the parks and reserves by law itself we 're under Clause 15 we 've simply added a new boards 15.1 and it reads to avoid any doubt nothing in this boil or limits the application of the Christchurch City Council reserves impairing at 1971 so basically saying that the reserves Act has the overall control and the management plan will work underneath that so there was a substantive changes to the mmm parks and reserves bottle thank you oh just this question for David I should just got a double check and I think I did really right but Sam just take driving in the 3d destroying wildlife you know every weekend and often and I just want to make sure that these new bylaws will but we will be able to control that behavior is but there was that there were a couple of other small things there we added in in the interpretations of aircraft unmanned aerial vehicles IE drones rather than two the description and then there was the only other matter really was under Clause sex interference with reserves and varying or scattering the ashes of deceased persons that clause was deleted and substituted under 6.2 with the new clothes the digger hold any grass the area or garden or scatter or bury anything so I think Glee and probably would like sort of elaborate a little bit he will but just explain sorry the drones what have you done do under the definition of aircraft so what what have you now prohibited drones from doing just added drones as to being a definition of a nice so right okay that 's good it 's gonna be interesting okay I 'm Glenn next yes thank you I met and then 4.6 I just wish to you know get this right with the council we have a relationship with MKT which we must uphold this as a matter of profound importance to them so my view and you 'll see i voted against this part of it is that we need to be very clear in the formation of this bylaw that the wishes of MKT are conveyed you 'll see under 4.6 that in the enabling of the scattering of ashes and public places the council would actually alienate nato who fun know from parks and reserves is that being definitely bound in those parks who reserves by the same protocol that apply for a designated burial site so its emitter we have to take quite seriously and so process wise and in terms of content of the bylaw i think we just need to this one right I respect David if he has a different view that 's fine but again if we wanted to adopt all bar one of the recommendations what would happen so it is within the power of the castle on this sort to the hair and spending okay thank you yep okay I accept your view on on this so I 'm just wondering how we would deal with it right somebody else had a question or something Jamie was next I think I just wanted just a bit more clarification sorry just around the drones and if so what is this just that we mean that you would be prohibited from flying radio-controlled aircraft with drying well under our current by law we do prohibit those sort of crap radio control crafts and things from our packs and drones is just a new piece of technology and we had a submission that thought we should include it so we included it so okay thanks Dave I 'm just a little bit unclear and maybe you guys can dramatically do then as a council because I understand it 's gone through a hearings process so it 's not really our place to pick and choose where I 'm going out with us as I think there 's a hell of a difference between a helicopter and an aeroplane and in a drone do it for goodness sake it 's just great fun if a kid wants to go down and play with his xmas prison in a park isn 't it it 's fantastic he 's not out doing p good on him he 's flying a drone in a park it 's totally normal and and why would we prohibit all 13 of the bile or deals with some aircraft and total and unpause 13-3 it does make an exception for us a person may operate power driven model aircraft and reserved on certain conditions so i think if a so-so the insertion of the into the definitions and aircraft so we have claws 13 which is no person may without written permission of an authorized officer after that lanyard and aircraft in a reserve take off in an aircraft from reserve will use the new craft to sit down pick out or recovering anything resume or parachute into a reserve so it was felt that the drones that are fitted into this the difficulty is however that whether a drone is more like a model aircraft given that you 're toy shop quite soon or whether it 's the sort that goes hard and I think there was also the sort of that concern expressed at the time that drones I can be used for aerial photography and and they were an invasion of the public private property adjoining a resistor sends out the drone and figure out what your neighbors up to think you can do that but I thought I think surely in their devine you know if someone 's using a drone as a as a peeping tom mechanism then are you call the police over there but if you know as a six-year-old kid or something gets a week drawing from Westfield for Christmas you know it 's just I think in 2014 or got 2015 it 's just a normal part of life that they go down to a park it 's probably a better clean fast assuming they 're not using for the high stone well as I said it was in response to a submission that we did get on on those so thinks the clarification on that I guess what I 'm you can see with it I disagree with that but is it actually relevant same i 'm imagining as the ashes and the potential did parts of people or people in parks and the effect that that has on at various cultures including mariculture and so I 'm assuming that you given that you could see in that one back and ask the hearings panel to reconsider it you could also send the one back about aircraft and whether we 're drones fit either in 13.1 or 13.3 back to be reconsidered yep so we 'll just come to the recommendation we can we approve this with the exception of those but I was assuming okay that 's probably a better way of doing it yep okay any other questions before we get into the debate yani if we 're gonna leave this on the table then I don 't think it 's worth while raising a whole bunch of concerns now or questions on other stuff no I think it is because I suspect what 's going to happen is that we are going to refer it back to timber deadline will be a bit tight for them give a little inebriated Dave allocated between Naomi well I just the changes that were made to add an order near early around nine point one I don 't understand why that that 's been added and also to understand that a 9.3 why the reserve that the things set aside for the parking of vehicles may be a restricted parking area I don 't understand why this changes okay so if we 're getting up to a huge number of changes we might have to ask them to do the whole thing again yeah that one 's concerning you do you want clarification yea though point sir yeah okay um as I understand that the word ordinarily it was suggested to be added to try to attempt like that cause more clear in terms of some so much as concerns that that the impression was that clause 1a is it stood allowed authorized Motor Vehicles and viewers that was SIDS turians or bicycles so the word ordinarily was added as a way of tip to further clarify that we 're as it stands the cause without the word ordinarily is in the bottle currently but without the term shared path so basically that that that calls is already in the bowl or without the word ordinarily and without the weird shape has so if the council don 't consider it adds anything to the clause then it would still has be interpreted in the same way without that word what I was really trying to understand is like so if you look at like hagley park you have a whole bunch of vehicles that go on during rugby games that just drive up the grass park on the side of the road on the side of the park near the sports fields and it would seem to me that that 's probably not something that you 'd want to call a legitimate eyes I mean it might happen on a one-off basis it 's done as a temporary under a temporary parking provisions i think in there so cars parking around take the park for example in the grass verge that 's ordinarily is that does that means it 's 's trying to make it harder and he 's concerned that this makes it easier yeah no it doesn 't make it easier see what exactly is no person may take right or drive any vehicle into or on any reserve and sit in areas where vehicles are allowed or if the weird ordinarily isn 't there ordinarily whatever what I 'm worried about is so if you look at the Verge 's around hagley park which i think is a really good example so people aren 't supposed to park there but they ordinarily they do come in all the display a good point so so I 'm just kind of to me ordinarily doesn 't help because it actually reflects a kind of behavior rather than a certainty so weird can be removed it was it was suggested a team took to meet the so much as consumers it wasn 't clear it keep clear laughs but what if you just put are legally allowed is it like what 's the problem we 're doing that so it 's really clear I we can 't amend this well that 's considered you can when we get to that yep because i think the aim was the same as what you 're trying to do but they can might be that if we can set yeah and in 9.3 can we just get a response as to what you 're trying to achieve feel okay we 've got minor changes which are really not changing not substantially undermining the deliberation of the hearings panel and really are minor changes and the and the council is happy that it 's satisfied has enough information to make them such as the removal of the word ordinarily I don 't think that 's a matter that substantially needs to go back to be reconsidered by the hearings panel okay I 'm actually taking a legal advice from the lawyer but we 've now got three major changes that people are suggesting so I 'm thinking this is if this was the only one I 'd probably take your advice on that and because the intent was exactly where Yanni is wanting to go but we 've now got three fairly substantive changes I 'm I think this is likely to go back to their hearings panel but I might be wrong what can I just clarify though is this by laura is the changes that we want that we were looking at an item 32 critical doesn 't affect it doesn 't affect it okay thank you very much thank you are there any other Christians there was a question from young unity and can you explain 9.3 yeah sorry thank you what was the concern with this force in a reserve those beats are so for parking vehicles may be restricted parking area under the traffic and parking Bible so what 's the intent is to clarify that an area that 's already set aside is a parking area in a reserve can also become under the traffic and parking viola restricted parking area which would a little out the council to issue infringement notices when they 're here in so it doesn 't meet it doesn 't allow the council to under the spy or create parking areas and reserves just as after an area has been set aside is a restricted parking area the purpose of issuing infringement notices because some parking areas and reserves have time limits on them and so the council would like to be able to enforce okay any other questions before you get to me which was a question debate with this allow us really sit aside an area for one of the major events and north headed park for instance and we 've set aside a temporary parking area for whether it what it is but what it does would that allow us to issue a ticket f for instance a car is parked under a tree or where it 's not meant to I 'm sorry I can 't answer that i 'm not completely clear on whether the ordinance when when the temporary power here is a seat up on the reserves whether that 's done under the traffic and parking ball or if that 's done under the management of playing arrangements for the reserves so i can 't i can look go away and cheap that though Jen 's have we got something are we getting beyond the point back ND ordinarily or do you want to send the whole thing back what do they need to do Peter send the whole thing back so would it be more since Glenn and pulling to send the whole thing back for a rehearing what that doesn 't have to be the same variance panel doesn 't further deliberations and then the panel can work out whether they need any more information or to hear from anybody else ok so the recommendation should be the word ordinarily okay so that we refer it back in particular around those three clauses the one running we 're only referring their deliberations will only be considering those three issues that okay that 's good through anything else you want to include a net not yep sorry it was just an expansion on the drones there I just wanted to say because I do apologize this because you guys have done a huge job there and I really appreciate I 'm sorry it 's just I fundamentally think the place for flying away radio-controlled aircraft is the power we 've got the drones in there aircraft yep yeah a helicopter the Christmas rush river your minds oh yeah me the toy of choice is Christmas our dryer yeah okay right is that what councils living sterling Cotters still want to move you okay with that Dave yep yep okay so should we have counselors Livingston and East moving next well I don 't think it 's perfectly okay okay so we have counselors ricotta and end off moving moving on second over okay just want to create that more 9.1 ordinarily not 9.3 sorry the ordinarily is in 9.1 not nine point thank you thank you that 's awesome right nothing else so we 're happy with us now okay can I put that a min that they 've done it yeah okay I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed

Housing and Economic Development Committee parties the sportsground charges issue certainly generated some discussion and we were keen to make sure that no group was disadvantaged but that we had a workable policy the committee recommendation the committee recommendation was that we yeah it should look at the ways that we can assist those non affiliated groups through the long-term plan but that we adopt the staff recommendation um you 'll see that I I didn 't vote along with it along with the counselor entertainer but given that we can review our fees and charges through the long term plan I do think we need to do some more work because what we want to do is encourage active recreation and remove barriers from people whether it 's expensive participation etc so i think the principles behind what the Rugby Club asking for was really good I think we need to do some more work around Oh what 's in here on the basis that we 're doing that further work which will happen in the next few months and likewise I think the danger with a a one-size-fits-all approaches that inevitably somebody gets left out and we need to appreciate that there are different types of sports groups out there some of which choose to affiliate some of which don 't exactly the same as counselor you 're handsome I 'm happy to support the recommendation today on the basis that we do look at other shins through

which one are you actually moving yeah any point 11 2001 yep yeah yep you know that would be my understanding as well that the later wouldn 't have gone yet pending the council resolution because of it came here and the council said no don 't do that so but will happen as a result of this two point one point two I do want a little bit yesterday at heart a as well which I 'm happy to you know move and Edric I would make the comment on up with officials on monday i think it is and dependent on the outcome of that meeting they may or may not be a need for a meeting mean to to meet with the minister and have a positive conversation about how we work through matters of interest for the city is a good thing but to do that if we 've already resolved that an officer level may not be necessary ethics so I mean I certainly don 't want to rule out the need to me get minister but I want to give the meeting on Monday the best possible chance of success it may well be that that doesn 't answer all our questions or put everything to bed in the way that we would like we can 't prejudge how that meeting echo there may subsequently be need to meet with the minister and that 's something that we okay to all sort that after monday the first one will happen anyway now hang on the committee 's already made that decision so what you 're saying is that won 't be acted on until after is that we still want a meeting with the minister to discuss victoria square otherwise if you don 't want that then you need to move if the issue has not been resolved then that meeting will be sought if the issue has been resolved and we don 't need the meeting then we won 't need to do it okay can I can I understand well no I think it 's quite funny Danny can I put the whole report like I just want to speak to 2.1 12.11 is now going to happen it wouldn 't normally happen if it says that the council it wouldn 't happen until the council has resolved that not the committee so will now help him great so we just we need a second day okay so sorry yep seeking to budge a me so I just speak in support yeah we have previously tried to meet with the minister of culture and heritage obviously within election there 's a new minister and I think that 's really good to try and take the opportunity unfortunate we didn 't get a meeting responsible given that with a lot of time around things like heritage recovery in putting money and resources into helping develop the heritage recovery plan which is still outstanding and still yet to be signed off government I think it is timely that we try and meet with the new minister to go through those previous concerns have heard about around heritage recovery in our city and I do note that other groups have extended invitations for her to come to christ church so I think that would be really good to do this urgently so that that there 's a chance you know visit to the absent or a visit to the museum actually tie them together worth worth coming and having a meeting with us so really I 'm think this is really important and very strongly supportive of okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those are post carried that

that she had passed and we do have our comments on those but starting at the ferry and whether we have the intersection with Lincoln Road I 'm not sure if you can see that as clearly there are already issues for pedestrians in the way that it 's been promoted to be designed bricks and ashphalt when you walk on them with a vision impairment they don 't give you different feedback it is impossible to tell that this area is being bricked because people don 't want me to be here they want me to walk around it they want nice up to go somewhere different so I just want to clarify some of the things that are coming through and so for someone who is blind deaf blind has low vision they may not be enrolled with us not everybody who has significant vision loss is eligible to be enrolled with the blind foundation so unless you have good vision bricking is not going to provide that that indication of where you should be the second point with this crossing and I know it already exists as a free lift n 2 and out of Lincoln Road given the increased traffic volume to be using more house I think that this is going to go up if it 's not well designed it is going to be an issue and I know that there 's a zebra crossing being shown on it the pictures i 'm showing our of the raised threshold coming out of Northlands mall it works well because there 's design in front for a car to sit waiting for that left hand free turn leaving the pedestrian crossing clear the threshold is of a design that you have to slow down to go off over it there are none others in christchurch that are being designed the classic if you certain you can watch the cars a that 's across the pedestrian crossing and B can do it at 40 kilometers an hour when they choose to where you 're designing the facilities to have the pedestrian and the cycle with our shared and they 're entering and exiting roads at the same time you have to design well the council engineers got it wrong initially when they first put there the new extension with the morehouse tablinum road extension in only putting the tactiles where they wanted the pedestrian to be there was nothing to guide the pedestrian to say you 're veering to where the cyclist could be there was nothing they were misaligned to get you across the road you could enter them canes go under the poles you trip over those into roadways etc it has to be across the full crossing and you have to have tapping rails so Invercargill this is where this picture was taken they didn 't actually need the tapping rail because it 's against a curb up stand with their refuge Island but tapping rouser and left out then we come to the shared paths themselves and the blind foundation doesn 't support shared paths at all we all know there are issues and other speakers have mentioned that there is no good international design around shared paths if you put them in how do you govern the behavior how do you tell people where you want them to be how do they cross two other sides how do they go into the park across the cyclist who could be commuting and at speed you know there 's been talk around having bowels having other indications a lot of my clients have hearing loss significant hearing loss and it can be in those upper frequencies so we 're going to encourage everyone to have the air horns that are quite frightening when they come up behind you because there 's weed tinkling bells which are lovely to listen to most of my clients aren 't going to hear them that those ear horns are really horrible a lot of mobility scooters use them now on the footpaths and they 're horrible because they get impatient and they when they use them the cross thing again we 're looking at a city that we want to promote walking and cycling we want to promote use of public transportation we 're still building roads for cars we 're making the pedestrian journey difficult and the plans that came out for that whole cross in around Hospital corner we 're asking the pedestrians to wait several phases to actually get to their destination and that was one of the things we submitted on as to why there was two left tuning lanes that the pedestrian and cyclist has to cross get to an island which has been enlarged so we can have more of a holding pen in the middle the behavior of the cyclist who wants to go straight as they 're going to go with the cars they 're going to come on to the road and they 're going to take the easy option which I would do and pedestrians now if you watch are still stepping out this is treatment in Barcelona where they have cycleways so they have the parking they have the cycle give way to pedestrians and all of the designs I 've seen coming through from the crash it cities Council engineers none of the designs required the cyclists to give way to pedestrians it is very difficult when you 're trying to cross a road listening for the traffic sounds to also listen for the site plus because that 's how we train our clients to Crossroads cyclists are on another form of transport they move faster they should be required to give way and there are other treatments internationally that work well with putting cycle lanes on the road where the traffic should be not putting them onto footpaths when we talk about delineation the blind foundation we 've been involved with projects and other cities and we 've looked at what can we can do to define space we spent a good three years working with Auckland Transport to come up with the shared spaces design and the approved delineator that will only be used in shared spaces it is not a visual contrast for the reason that it 's in shared spaces where we don 't want faster if you define it with color and de market for cars they will go faster but it 's tactile it has to be a minimum of six hundred in width so when you think about she had passed you 've got to think about a tactile delineator that if you approach from an angle a 45 degree angle a 90 degree angle will I actually step on it to know that I 've found that that 's the important that so the directional tile shown in the other picture the elongated bars that people into they find them usually perpendicular that 's it up to be perpendicular to your path or travel to indicate you change and if you want to cross here or go to the destination that you know is this way this is the point where we are asking you to turn and go that we chose not to do that in the shared past because we don 't want to define it in that way but they all have the accessible route which has no signage no billboards no furniture in that accessible route was the weather that demarcation is 600 so it can be detected and people can stop before they cross zones not realizing not all of our clients a competent came travelers who can pick a straight line and keep to that straight line you close your eyes or lie reduce some of your vision try and walk in a straight line but they also have to avoid other pedestrians and step round so with the delineator there are the surface that still enables wheelchairs and other mobility devices if you do need to pass to use that space walk on it comfortably without tripping if we 're looking at shared paths we need to have something of 600 minimum if not 800 if it 's a commuter route I 'd go to 800 to give more warning time and a color delineator the other thing that concerns me is if we are looking to go to shared paths and also then getting rid of footpaths it doesn 't give the option for those who are not confident on shared paths but also those who don 't want to enter the parkways all our city principles do we want pedestrians away from where there could be that surveillance of houses of other traffic driving past to be walking through hagley park at night it 's an option for some people but we still need to maintain the accessible routes for people who want them and it is a commuter route to the hospital so they were the main points just wanting people to look at the wider issues my proposal is why don 't we make them single phase crossings at hospital corner for a start it 's the super stop it 's the bus stop this I submitted all this earlier to the council why can 't we have the second left turning lane to also be the right turning lane the volumes of traffic are we planning to say two cars this is where you should be going we want you to come or are we saying we want you to bust to some of these destinations we want you to walk every car driver is also a pedestrian and you know I am concerned when you think of planning always the reason for shopping at that particular place and if they 've only got one car park and somebody else is in it does everybody else pass that business by do they get one customer per hour for three or four businesses but yeah proposing that we look at having easier crossings for pedestrians encourage them that we 're planning we want you to choose active modes of transport to get to places I 'm concerned with Oxford terrace I don 't know and I had put questions around who 's going in and out of it and what are the movements there what are the pedestrian movements to the hospital from the Superstock it 's not shown what that journey is for for the pedestrian the other area was antiguos street which curtain yep to what ago yeah we don 't have a cross thing that did cross the fourth crossing now I don 't know why we can 't have it it 's only the vehicles tuning right that would have to give way makes it an accessible journey and also Oxford terrace again having the signalized Sierra projects which aren 't shown and these celebrity live as my forgot to do with petitions there aren 't any so that was easy and then I 'm going to move on to the community boards just in case they 're sheer person 's needs to get away because I 'm aware that he 's been here quite some time so we 'll start with those before we come back to this clause we are required we need to do the Headley reserves file or the section yet before we come back to some of these issues okay okay we 're away we were community board welcome _"

    "text": "you know the rules I think yes I think so start off with Professor kisling Thank You ranch there is a handout going around which is pertinent to the interpretation of the proposal we learning we commend that back in August the resolution that you made then was a positive step the process of attracting more people to cycle to and from work we applaud that we just about the problem what we face in this particular instance and the detail of this particular plan is going to have Swift commuter cyclists in conflict situations with pedestrians who will include those that are hard of hearing poorly cited or with other physical disabilities using a painted line and printed signs it 's contrary to good traffic management there is a missing option we were not in the hearings we were not presented with an option that parently the council staff had considered for the commuter cycleway to be just outside the park on hagley avenue that was not something that we had a chance to comment on though we would have supported that had it been in there we also of the existing path in southie park is subject to the what you are dealing with later in this council meeting with the bylaws the traffic and parking bylaws we have made representations to the council on an issue there we ask you to take that seriously into consideration I 'm not going to litigate it here now we 're really just looking at this this particular shared path situation but it is linked to the vitals concerning that particular path and and the shared space my very blunt Australian professional colleagues would say Blaine Freddie could see that it 's not good research and common sense indicate that the separation of traffic that travels at relatively different speeds is to be preferred where possible rather than asking users to share the path this is relevant when we 've a fit-for-purpose option can be created at marginal cost as part of the intended accessible City project and in the detailed project boots from hagley Avenue we say there 's no widening needed if growth in the conventional commuter cycling which you are looking and seeking is accommodated nearby on its extra distance involved at all i would add there 's no need even to consider the future accommodation of fast travelling electric power-assisted cycling commuters within the park area if you have such a facility out on the roadway there 's no need to increase the paved area under mature heritage trees and over their root zones and we haven 't had the benefit of an arborist report of what the impact of that widened would be there 's no need to shift Olympus of the standards that are there now and incur those additional costs and pedestrians and joggers and lazy recreational cyclists can continue to co-exist in relative safety but we 're not given details or the cost comparisons nor are we given the analysis of those comparisons we are told the outcome of the staffs assessment and they recommending a particular option there 's no analysis and explanation in percent of public that I 'm aware of how all Park users will benefit from four meter wide path using an ever-increasing number of computer cyclists inside hagley park it will be a hard sell to pedestrians with 's not a future-proof solution that you are putting up it does not accord with the Hagley Park management plan despite what is said in the report and the handout runs through the details of where we see it does not accord there is the alternative which we would commend the resurrected and looked at carefully so we 're commuting cyclists can be protected from motorized traffic on similarly direct routes and we 're commuting cyclists do not compromise the safety of slower traffic such as perdition 's and joggers and where the intrinsic values of the park are protected into the future and the project costs can be contained we ask you councillors to make a fully informed and rational decision that can command the respect of the general public we support the thrust generally overall thrust of the transport network proposals it is in these details revealed in particular cases that the option preferred by the council staff and this one we see as suboptimal on a number of grounds in terms of costs safety and the ongoing stewardship of hagley park it is not too late to why should repair money be used for a safety suspects illusion when a safer equally effective and probably cheaper option is available and I prefer now to Martin right I would actually suspect there 's going to be a few questions on this and I don 't want to run out of time you know particularly on the costing of it etc so i think i 'll defer and leave it up to questions thank you regarding the your suggestion of having the cycleway out a Jason to really hagley Avenue so there would also we would understand though that it also need to be room for a footpath alongside higley revenue so an end our understanding to is that in fact while the while the area around the network courts is sufficiently wide in fact further down there would be insufficient wealth the need for a footpath for pedestrians on that side of hagley Avenue I question because their most them would used inside the park as their petition where you certainly would need one on the other side of the street on the southern side of the street said I suggest that you need crossing points but you don 't necessarily need walking parallel you can do that in safety inside the park just a few steps further into the parking you 're on that um have you seen a copy of the address report no okay so i don 't know i mean a problem obesity krishna start it was done with fifth of november 2014 so i think there was after the public submissions had closed we didn 't see it before the public snare okay even seen it at all haven 't seen it before okay so maybe we can our staff to give a copy just just in terms of like we 've heard from every pretty much regardless of how everyone 's agreed that the current design is actually floor and some work i think possibly with the exception of the first speaker that we heard do you think wishes been which i 'm trying to come up with a new design and given our financial situation do you think that this is really a priority in terms of spitting this money now i don 't see it as a priority within the greater cycle cycling nitwit but I do see that you have a chance to include it in the works on the roadway so that you could you 're going to be doing things out there making the a cycleway there for the commuter cyclists who really are a different breed of people a recreational cyclists of the community cyclists have completely athlete different needs one 's heads down and tail up and cycling flat out the other is cycling sedately perhaps for recreational purposes I mean well yeah the question is given that we just spent nearly 10 years ago hundreds of thousands putting in a commuter cycle way down peg liev do you think it 's good use of our money to start going in and doing a new plan ahead of other stuff in the city that is you know now I would excite would say put the money in other parts that are more desperate means you want to make no I just hands off Hagley fully support professor kiss me thank you very much indeed thank you very much thank you and Karina _"

but includes that provision for any questions as well so we 're all clear on that and the first one i have is green curry thanks again this is the relation to Clause thirty-two of the agenda but I intend to do just for the community for tears for here is listen to all the deputations and then take the community board tears because I know some of you need to be away and then go back to this item okay thanks again we 're in your hands great thank you madam chair good morning everyone thanks for the opportunity to speak today I 'm Glen curry I 'm representing spokes _``_63.449 to represent the people who make really about 50,000 cycling trips a day around the city the fifty percent of crisis residents who already typically ride a bike at least once a year and indeed the greater proportion of people that we feel would like to cycle or would like to cycle more but are currently concerned with the environment that 's out there at the moment so we 're very supportive of the general plans for what 's coming up in Christchurch here so I wish to speak to Ivan 32 today the accessible transport one is two main aspects that I 'd like to speak to and then happy to take some questions firstly the Selwyn street cycle lanes and the Hagley Park shared pathway so firstly Selwyn street you may recall the original proposal head cycle lanes in the section of Selwyn street from hag liev to morehouse F and the new proposal has taken them away we felt they did make sense to have them in there because you were going to have more traffic or buses being directed and down what is now effectively an has been with arterial roads parking as a privilege it 's never been a right there and so that 's the principle that I think we should be applying in the situation now we acknowledge that there are going to improvements either side grove road and antiguos street going to be major cycleway routes and going to see improvements along there but you 're still going to have some demand for cycling down selwyn street as well particularly two access points of Eddington and sprayed in as well and so without doing any treatments there You 've going to have more traffic on sale one Street basically you 're going to make conditions worse for those who are still choosing to cycle down Selwyn street there I know local businesses and this vicinity of concerns about the parking I would have thought local businesses certainly the type that I observed there would have been expected to have sufficient off street parking for both these staff and their customers its basic district plan 101 and so an expectation of on-street parking does seem out of step with there I also notice a lot of the on street parking there is actually coming from further away as well it 's reasonably close to town it 's it 's an unlimited parking at the moment and I suspect people using perhaps the hospital 's a college or other destinations around town that thing that is convenient all-day parking it 's less about the businesses immediately they 're actually if you do decide to retain the on street parking as being proposed in the the note today we 'd requested at the very least you retain the cycle facilities that were proposed at the intersection of cell and street and morehouse I should note that you know two-thirds of all urban cycle crashes happen at intersections they are the most critical parts of the network certainly when I cycle downs Selwyn Street the mid blocks are usually not a big problem but somewhere like cell when more house is uncomfortable is problematic at the moment and will continue to do so if not much has done to it I see there are plans to be some a proposed advanced stop boxes still at the its own unless you 've got a safe way to get to them so i would suggest at least having the cycle lanes leading up to the intersection be retained and as far as i can see that would only affect about two or three of the car parks that are currently there and could still retain the others if that was your decision from there so I finish this allen street with just that key point that i would like to see at least in sections for cycle facilities retained we as folks certainly prefer to see the original proposal maintained with the cycle lanes and their entirety tuning to the heckler Park shared paths now now we understand that there 's a lot of concerns about conflicts on the shared paths as they stand I can appreciate that I cycle through there every day to work and it certainly frustrates me when I have to sort of work my way through other joggers walkers bikers you name it going through so there 's a lot of common conflicts going through there have I would acknowledge that the most fact that in Christchurch we 've never really provided proper shared paths to meet the actual peak demands that are there it 'd be a bit like making Blenheim roads six metres wide and then wondering why there 's lots of conflict and congestion that 's pretty much what we 're trying to do on some of our busiest shared pathways at the moment so it 's not surprising that we see a lot of this conflict as it stands if I look around the whole city of it I would I 'd say my assessment there 's probably only about two shared parts in the entire city that I would consider adequate for the current demand that 's on them and none none of them are in hagley park so I think when we 're looking at a four metre proposal wide cheered part it 's quite a game changer we do not have anything like that in the city so it 's very hard to understand its potential effects until we see it in action it will make a big difference based on my experience of similar facilities not just on its own but with encouragement of better shared behaviors and I would endorse treatments like markings or signs to get some of that better behaviour encouraged as well so things like arrows or lane markings to encourage people to keep left and less of passing for example that so quite a common use overseas and seems to work pretty well and getting a good etiquette if you like from all paths users going through there and then there 's other things like getting off the past when you 're stopped and sounding out warnings and controlling your dogs and so forth that would also be good as well but just doing that will help but to be honest the four meters alone will make a big difference to the conflicts that are currently there I acknowledge some of the concerns from the vision impaired community about wider paths and how that would be dealt with and I think this is where kind of treatments like tactile marking should certainly be looked at to help provide some kind of guiding route for vision impaired users I believe someone 're not quite sure what demand were going to see it from these future major cycleways or indeed improvements to the network as a whole and so it may be that if demand outstrips the four meters with in due course we should certainly be considering our wider of separate facilities later on for walking and cycling I would argue that just automatically providing parallel facilities doesn 't necessarily guarantee you 're going to get separation quite often we 're ready see on existing separated cycleways things like Tennyson Street and Matt I street I do see pedestrians quite often using those as well as an additional space so it 's not always guaranteed you 're going to get that separation especially if the two facilities look quite similar as well I think there need to be quite a bit of work quite clear demarcation to indicate which one was for pedestrians which one was for cyclists so it 's not an easy solution that way either as well I 've heard some comment that these proposals are turning hagley park into a transport facility I say that that point has served as a transport connection for thousands of people a day walking and cycling through there and we 'll continue to do it certainly serves me every day to get to and from work as well so the problem has been albeit to date it 's been with poor facilities to cater for those people so I 'll leave it there in terms of the key points I wanted to make and I 'm happy to take some questions thank you um just with regards to the cycle lane on salem street between say Brown Street and the railway lines we have mainly paints we have our old old people 's home probably more problematic would be the daycare next to that we have a community butchers which some would argue was there before selling street we have a dearie we have a a as well the question is what 's regards to the cycle lanes on Centaurus road where we really we 've focused on the riding taken a lot of parking up they have special areas we parks can be put on would that be acceptable if especially say in front of the daycare facility that the butcher etc deadly apart so the cyclist that were designated so the cycle lanes were safe but their areas really was precisely what your thoughts on that yeah I think that 's an acceptable solution in some cases to resolve the fact that there are isolated situations which are not easily dealt with by just getting rid of the parking there 's not an easy close option it there 's a cost here but that I think is the cost of progress thank you um thanks for submission I 'm not sure if you 'll be able to answer this but do you have any idea which direction most of the cyclists will come from to use cell when street if these a cycleway in there will they be coming from perhaps the Selwyn shops or do you think they 'll come from morehouse even swing around do you think there 'd be a dominant route Thea that they 'll be taking my suspicion would be there to be the ones coming through from Selwyn Street further south because if probably be looking to hook into the new facilities that are going to be there at grove road and antigo street right thank you you know I guess just what you 're referring to in terms of the change of behavior just wonder if in fact what we also mean is so in christchurch we need a change of culture around transport in terms of courtesy and respect in terms of Hell in fact pathways might be able to be shared better than they currently are got a comment on there yeah I think that 's fair comment but power of the problems at the moment we don 't provide good guidance on that until recently we had signs that just sort of said look out for each other share which didn 't really tell you anything specific so I quite like what we 're starting to see now and have seen overseas where we start giving specific guidance like keep left unless you pass and get off the pathway if you stop to have a chat to someone you know now people can start to relate to practical things and I 'd endorse doing that and some of that can be by marking snow just the occasional center line and a couple of arrows just to keep telling people just nudge over to the left and then you don 't get the whole shall we dance which way you 're going to go thank you Peter said okay mix _"

item 19 page 181 and then I think we 're only left with your the Burwood recovery park and then the end wants to come back what I 've excluded okay just don 't tell her yet because these guys may take you one at least of course we 're all fine with it Pauline i knows it tell me no this arrangement that the town will will pay for some of these costs but how far down the track is being settled was it yep it hasn 't been it hasn 't been finally agreed yet and it 's probably fair to say that we 've got some potential agreement around the what we believe is the first I suppose the knowin costs but the the way that the OIC is structured and it 's similar in Auckland the hearings panel has a lot of discretion about additional reports and it can ultimate cost might be and we 're still working through with government officials about how we might share some of that cost as well okay okay any other questions briefly and succinctly Andrew referring to paragraph four point one point one let the first paragraph of that section members have been appointed to the hearings panel by the ministers in consultation with the council yes could you describe what that consultation was and how it took place please that consultation was it was discussed with with the mirror and the mirror we were invited to make some comment on them we had previously in arrangements with working with Sarah officials provided potential lists of of potential hearing panel members along with Sarah themselves and worth I think he can were also invited to nominate some people but the OIC as you can clearly note basically provides that the ministers actually appoint the panel and in the discussions that were had but with with council laws and with the mirror by the minister two minutes of the time no surround him into atoms that was made clear that while our views appointing okay any other questions Yanni ya think so how many of the people that we put forward have been put on this panel all right well I think it 's probably I think that 's a difficult question to answer and not so much in it well it 's not a finite number but i think it draws it potentially it draws attention but a number of the people on this panel are people that we 're on lists that were common to both EK and sierra and council is that first one right is that soo name right on the environment court judge yes yes yes there 's a bit of a min skill and eight life difficult we 've got a John Henson no John Hanson Energon Judge John per second of this career okay thanks Jimmy only one one issue regarding to the coaster we reviewed a page on 186 and all 187 expectation budget and approved budget only one item the staff hosted here original is the 3.9 minion all right now increase 26 points able use that increased 2.8 million I 'm not sure environment call this dispute osito less reasonable for consulting fee hearing but stuffy may increase how many stop numbers and there is an increase in additional staff over across the whole SPG and the council the difference here is that we have got people outside the planning unit working on this process for example we 've got urban designers from a different unit we 've got landscape architects from a different group all together we 've got G is from a different group and council I 've got a number of different professional staff that don 't normally work on the district plan working in this team overall there are about a hundred staff from across council working on this project ok so there 's not a part of consulting fee there 's simply no that 's 70 oh that 's hard of staff that 's creepy ok thank you thanks Paul it 's just a quick follow on from what Yanni was saying about the list of people who are on here if these heaven being selected by us and being selected by let 's say he hadn 't 's decisions are not required to be referred to the council for approval so in other words they could potentially change a majority of our work to a different degree that we 've actually pulled the district plan review so in other words if the stuff with a chaplain who should play and the stuff of this island point could be changed radically from what they accept that yes potentially at one extreme that 's correct at the end of the day and the principle that was established was as part of the OIC process the council would write the plan it would go to an dependent and I suppose experience panel of people involved in the RMA and in sort of that whole land development area and they 're obviously they have to have regard to the automator have to have regard to the Sarah legislation pepper it might want to comment so I mean it 's not as though they have a carte blanche opportunity to go their own direction they are working within established legal parameters and applying the expertise to it and we end all the this group of people who go a different direction to what they might want so I suppose we have in some respects in the hands of that hearings panel and of course any decision that the hairies panel can make if they are in law that store can be challenged our pets I 'll get bred to just comment with more food I think we understand this time you understand it yeah thank you happy face yeah what Sony ban finances I just wanted to get them just to bring it out because we 've put a lot of stuff around a shoe design guidelines and a sustainable and so forth and that concerns me a favor will remove okay is there any other questions very briefly yani still just going through the membership can we get a bow of John sex and I thought wasn 't clear are you saying that in the list that we put forward to government that we had a number of these people on that list yeah yeah all right so so I mean I 'm just really concerned about um yeah how many developing a big subdivision here hmm I wants to social housing yeah i think they are in terms of their own independent hearings i know they have been appointed they 've been appointed on their merits and they are drawn across a range of criteria but just all right no no no sorry more questions okay so can I ask the terms of reference which we were told we have a rapport come back to us around the costs and the turbid reference before it was for a final decision why haven 't they come back to us for a final decision and why are we had no important to turn two reasons well the terms of reference are set by the crown for the hearings panel and under the OIC I 'm not sure why you were you don 't have this council has no actual decision making power to speak to the terms of reference okay right can we move on as a remover for this yeah jamie is there a seconder Ellie can I put the update on the district plan review with the staff recommendations that concerned about this whole process I know that we delegated to a small group of councils to be involved in this and look at the speedy ated process I have some really concern that because these issues were raised when we were discussing the lane use recovery plan I am really really concerned that we haven 't had it important to the terms of reference I thought we 'd be consulted over the terms of reference and I thought we as counselors would be consulted over the appointments of the panel members and I think just having a conversation with me it doesn 't actually mean that we as elected members are consulted so I just feel really concerned that this process has really been controlled by the government and that we seem to be as elected members really on the outside looking in over what is a really significant piece of work for our city so you know I 'm really reluctant to support the operating budget being transferred to capital given that we were told in the eighth of July that we would have a report come back finding out today that we 're actually being asked to Richard spectively approve a process transfer of funds so you know I just I thought I really struggle with what 's happening here I struggle with the fact that the OIC says that we have to pay for all the expenses and that we still don 't seem to have any cost controls in place over what those expenses could end up being so yeah that instant I will vote against us I think given the fact that we have financial major financial issues given that we have almost zero input as elected members into this process other than that getting doing the draft and sending it out for public notification that I can 't see why we should have to be incurring additional costs retrospectively I just don 't think it 's fair rule ok any other speakers breath just to add to what Mike will say we did have a small group but pointed who were delegated to oversee this process and we were involved in the whole terms of reference and we were involved in the selection that 's what we did obviously there were robust conversations in that process and I know Mike did a lot of work on getting those costs down as much as possible clearly the cost is not something we 've been loving to bear at the moment but that 's just the facts of the matter and so I don 't see that there was anything wrong with that process ok I 'm going to put the motion this is any feel discussion up at the motion those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you and the last one _"

like me to go over the the executive summary no we we 're okay with reported after my annual report okay sorry sorry so is there a mover for this get breath do want to move it yep back moves okay and Paul you want to speak to her just that hi co now we 're talking for years since the earthquake and we had Rachel leaf I think to about forty fifty percent for actually some of the people on the port hills and most people who now been out of their houses for now for years but some of them paying mortgages now also paying rent and we know the rent market and what it 's doing to our people of Christchurch the amount of people receiving their rates rebate has actually reduced significantly others actually I 'll never a decreasing decline in that area however there are a few cases and just quite badly through this here and would be good to have some discretion around who can and can 't receive this you saw with the flood that it will received a full remission for their ability be able to occupy their houses and it seems to me that this seems a little under fear that we 've got people that still lives in this position for years on you know I don 't expect a massive take up and on this hippo we good to go to give the staff some ability to look at it on a case-by-case basis rather than coming back to the full council for a full discussion I think we 're trying to as a council be a can-do council one that actually allows our staff some of the recien and making some decisions and you know I think that sort of sometimes can relieve some of the oxy that we find certain things in certain instances end up and what people come against a brick wall of bureaucracy so can i seduce that those clear thing here that stuff really didn 't want this if you want some degree of flexibility can I suggest that you suggest a mechanism where it comes for example to the monthly finance committee or strategy and Finance or whatever it is so that you 're not putting the onus on staff but that you 're putting it on the people who deserve the problem look either way I 'd like to see something something mechanism put in place no really you need to move an amendment then pour if you want to do something like that but I suggest from what the staff are saying that they don 't particularly want a tree singles done okay well then I 've move it ammendment to there 's something to the gree we 're actually on a case-by-case basis people who have requested some assistance and a full rebate on their rates have a mechanism to be able to actually bring to either a committee or some real can oh yes yes yes so at the moment we can do it now the finance strategy and Finance Committee is that where they currently go if there is such a request would suggest that the sort of thing that you 're looking at is on a case-by-case basis any possible remissions be dealt with by strategy and Finance with delegated authority or something like that if you want to think about that for a moment yani were unique sorry no Glenn oh you weren 't just procedurally i think i 've seen it but too soon battle to actually fairly lined up with paul so okay anyway that 's it on the table so I canceled a golfer 's the Second Earth you mean yep okay right that 's that 's all we wanted Yanni so we currently have a policy where report can come to counsel but to this vinyl that 's no report to become to counsel for consideration so oh you know I I mean I propose doing a notice of motion which has generated this report and i hope always talk to the mirror and staff around trying to get a report into this yeah so if staff are reluctant to have that discretion I mean I agree we need to set up a mechanism to actually because people are really stressed out and it is quite you know there are special circumstances so if I guess as a question of staff if you feel uncomfortable having that discretion nice trick my heaven these cases come in reports to counsel and what do we need to do to ensure that we can get a good decision-making process around this case it 's probably directed at you be yes if I could refer you to footnote 2 at the bottom of page 172 so where there are policy issues that need to be addressed and they can be turned around and unreasonably and you know we 'd always liked them to be faster prompt manner so the response to the match 2014 flood events was relatively fast and that created a new remission policy category which then staff can apply and can apply unambiguously and easily so it doesn 't have the impacts of potential staff costs and time ambiguity lobbying so made it really clear so whether those where their policy issues such as that they can be brought up quite quickly and you 'll see from the number of rating units ranges from 1 through 2 1800 so there is that ability on a policy basis to actually be quite targeted as well and so it 's not that staff don 't want to apply a policy as that they don 't want to shouldn 't have the the policy diameter as part of the makeup we should be applying policies rather than creating okay but I 've passed on a number of these cases and people have received leaders and you know penalty payments and are quite stressed out in terms of thinking about what criteria could be applied to those cases is that something you can come back to us with some sort of short order so that we can think about what we might do in that the classic one for me as the well the two classic ones are the fetus ago our program someone 's property and then no one knows who what the fence is up and there 's kind of like you know but we 're told that they can never access to their property but no one knows know some public body or the ones in the land mass movement who can 't get building consents because they 're in a class one intolerable area and you know are really stuck and have been charged for traits which seems inherently unfair so it is another one of the issues you only the fact that this has to come at a public meeting well I mean I don 't not apart oh I 'm not sure but okay the current the current situation any if you 've got them is that they come to the council for discussion but who drives that report because it 's not coming from staff well I 'm assuming it we do ourselves no I 'm assuming if you 've got cases where people are in hardship that you take it to somebody in finance or rates and they will get a report all that hasn 't is that is that an ok system there is an okay system absolutely we 'd apply the the current policy to those situations in where their current policy was not applicable England then if there was a lot committee would we take a stratagem clean strategy and finance right strategist running fine right okay so if you 've got those two others that you 're talking about give them to Peter and he 'll make sure somebody looks at them and gets a report if there is something that can be done or if there 's something that we need to consider as a possibility to be done well well you 've got a mechanism now he 's so what you think that 's not what I 'm saying at all and if the issue is raised with the particular constituent that are they valid for a remission then we 'll look at that and say under the terms of the policy here say all right if that then is a no but there are certain characteristics which deemed to start to create a category then we would bring back a category type of question we wouldn 't be applying a fair and equitable ambiguous type of policy okay all right can I go down the side now I 've got a li li and David so if this is something that needs to be discussed else else we because it does relate actually to the policy that 's the interpretation of it can I ask questions around that well ask the question and we 'll tell you then ok I have you that right so I 'm page 117 there are three broad types routine earthquake fair and equitable when we look at the earthquake Commission 's it 's got specific to earthquake damage my question is where the earthquake damage then results and repair that requires the person to be out of the home in one case I 've been dealing with recently was ten months can that come under earthquake dem would damage because it is directly the repair is related to that damage it 's an interpretation thing around the earthquake damage generally not know that the way we 've been applying it is that we 've been giving it to people who are out of our houses and then the houses are not yet being repaired for the period that they 've got to take go out of their houses during repair that now the probably worth clarifying that this two situations don 't think of one is where the place has been uninhabitable and they have been out for a while at the point that repairs start we won 't suddenly to slap the rates back on but here goes out the casing I 'm thinking all I 'm thinking of people are out of their houses and for the example I just explained so can I assume that if there is a new category that is not currently covered then the possibility would be that the possible new category was considered by strategy and Finance of those who are out of their home for earthquake Nikki Bella knocked a cat video I 'm just late payment penalty same page up to one hundred percent remission in cases genuine one off error it relates to era by staff and all resident yes I guess I mean typically the intention is for resident or especially automatic payments that I understood what the end of the world oh yeah but I just wanted to go by there and last one page 171 three etc underneath the second dot the clear dot the see-through dot cannot progress with repair until the after councillors computer drainage one of the problems that we 're hearing about particularly I think well it 's across the city but install burns to and cannot progress with repair because of insurance and EQC delays though at the moment we there are delays relating to eq c and insurance which is very very common people aren 't able to get on but it doesn 't fit the criteria Oh again is that something that takes strategy painting that 's a change of policy it might be worth talking offline because there 's a lot of overlap there with people in similar situations with earthquake damage and there 'll be literally thousands of people having their faces or pqc and insurance delays and I 'm not sure that 's to keep the sort of area we have to get into but cannot progress until after council has completed drainage and remediation if people cannot progress was repair because of insurance and EQC delays the principal is basically exactly the same as now question if it come up because I think she 's been dealing with some of these as it possibly it is relating to the flooding yeah it 's not love you know some consolation okay i think it wasn 't it quite christian we will talk offline about outfit KKK this interesting point i think the principle behind this when we wrote it was that what we 're trying to do is give people some kind of compensation admits leave rent to be limited but recognize where they can 't get on with their lives because of something that we 're doing rather than something that insurers or eqc or their neighbors or anyone else skin is or is not okay because there 'll be a number of people in difficult situations because of their neighbors or because of their insurance companies or whatever else and there 'll be an awful lot of that they don 't have a quite a different financial implications to where we 're saying look you can 't get on it 's our fault i 'll be recognizing that until it 's had a chat mean debate this is about you and I let me just check David is yours a question or debate nothing oh she was a question no debate discussion okay no further questions one last question I just wanted to understand our existing policy we have wording in there that allows council to make a decision around I think it 's fair and equitable is that is it right so there 's a current policy that says council can buy resolution make rates r emissions that are fair and equal or something on on on hard shell so what I 'm still struggling to understand is if we 're doing their end but we can 't get reports generated to do that then what do we need to do differently so that we can actually get reports to do that so that 's our current rates from a support no now we 've got the question you 're just waiting for the answer there 's no breakage in the length that I can see for there not to be a mechanism for a report so if you 're not getting reports bigger answer and so can I didn 't move an amendment um yes you may yeah because clearly um you know there 's um a desire to just move the amendment and we 'll see if we get a secret out yeah so can I move that um so there 's a minute moved by Councillor your head second council delegate to the strategy and finance committee to consider this report and any other it doesn 't need to consider this report does it well how are you and you just now like if you 've got queries you take them to the appropriate person and if there is a basis for a report to go to council through strategy and Finance they do it if you are feeling like nothing 's happening you 've got Peters phone asleep I don 't know way another three months and I get let go that 's why I think you need what you 're moving yani you 've now got a situation where you 're clear that if people are not being treated fairly and equitably you get the report from staff people I thought we heard before that staff wanted criteria they didn 't want to just write reports without having inner criteria that 's why we have been getting reports today the report would need to be from my perspective a suggestion around a new category that fitted within a fair and reasonable or fair and equitable portion so that councillors could then resolve to create their category and as i said earlier those those targets and those resolutions can work from anywhere from 1 to 1800 so any one person who feels like they 're in a situation that as Steve said was more of our making than theirs or more of our making and insurance companies could actually come and approach via you or anyone to have a new category listed of rates remissions have I misunderstood that no that 's correct and that would enable by going back to the committee to do full and frank discussions around what that might cost me that 's why I 'm thinking yani that your Amendment actually slows down the process you are trying to achieve oh no I definitely I 'm just mindful it is people that have been getting you know lanalee letters and told that things are going off their mortgage got pretty stressed out ya know we understand that so you 're about to have a discussion with somebody in the rates department and and if you 're not satisfied with Peter and then if there is a possible fair and reasonable category that can be gleaned then that will come to strategy and finance already without this report going there for consideration Australian and then put on making Australian find any has to report to Council so that could take 2-3 months could we just delegate strategy applies to make it is if you want to do that and so you could suggest that the process the process of fair and equitable policy decisions be delegated to the strategy and Finance Committee that 's what you want to me again just trying to get your amendment to achieve what you wanted so that 's moved councillor johansson as its second dental second did Paul oh no no that yeah put it in the amendment yeah Finance Committee so right yet Danny add ya delegated to okay is that what you want or just no no is that what you want he 's snow binary is not a change it or key to councillors I think that came for it just to come straight to the full council okay a new delegation so right okay so do you want to remove the amendment okay right mmm it 's gone away right ok no we 're now under discussion and I 've got was it you clean that 's big yep no just look ok wish you all were here in the last tomb when we were dealing with a lot of we only on the basis that we wouldn 't be now that 's Israel when we were dealing with a whole lot of red zone because this has been a source of ongoing frustration for me and Yanni and the council is representing that the eastern wards I guess I can see both sides of this I mean I certainly obviously our side but the staffs as well so when I approached staff over individual policy i can see that i can see that invidious position that puts them in like I can kind of accept that but we 've come in with this can-do approach so can we actually find a tool that works around for instance I think about that kind of living condition I tried to promote in the last term about habitability so you talk about a dwelling that can be occupied it 's not the same thing as saying it 's habitable it 's kind of an that arbitrary realm where it gets tricky and where the policy doesn 't quite work that we can make find ways you know something like this to take it on a case-by-case basis I know any Samaritans constituents would really appreciate that so yeah really support this is I said procedurally I 've fired too soon because I 've got the name up sickening the original motion okay that was actually a foundation to it sorry sorry Chris that was one I need to change that one 's canceled oh gosh okay right thank you Dave did you want to speak no Phil in terms of it being extremely difficult for people almost to survive but I think we need to keep in mind and what sort of council responsibility and what of other organizations responsibilities including insurance and I I make sure you 're so concerned though if we adopt a case-by-case sort of policy that in fact we could end up dealing with a huge number of cases and I think we need to be really clear about establishing further criteria if necessary if we can from those cases we 're getting so that we consider those I think the whole point about no compensation about being due to what counsel counsel sort of them has done is really important equally any any additions we have to be clear because we as a council also need to be continued to be accountable and also open their processes so basically well I understand the concern for it for many individuals I 'm reluctant that we as a council deal with them on a case-by-case basis we have to establish the policy and it was new criteria we can add 2 i 'm respond to that Sam we didn 't cause the floods they were caused by natural occurrences and we gave the full rights permission the earthquake is a natural occurrence prevented one that was you know had a greater impact than the floods so we have some responsibilities around that and that 's that 's my concern is it we 're going to be fear and even across the board full resolution for floods not for some people that have stuck in these situations on the hill or other areas where they 're not getting that full remission so it 's really about us having that damn right balance and being said being fierce it seemed to be fair and equitable across the board thank you Yanni yeah I think it 's really important if you look at part of our current policy it is actually dealing with if you look at an accessible commercial property property cannot be accessed for assessment or a beer dude you 're dangerously earthquake-damaged adjacent building so that 's not caused by us but what we recognize is that there are exceptional circumstances beyond anyone to pay right if you look at the land mass movement someone from Green Zone to class one intolerable and has to wait for the remediation work to be done by council you know I just think it 's we have to get a way of dealing with these issues and a much more can-do attitude around what is reasonably fair and i think you know we 're not talking about thousands and thousands of cases we 're actually talking about a few cases of extraordinary circumstance just to have some discretion so that we don 't end up going through a whole confrontational approach but actually work with local people over some of these really important issues so the fact that people can 't use their land and have to continue to pay rates I just cannot understand why we would be charging them rates and you know they told by the port hills geotech people to contact the rates department then we get contact with those counselors because the rates department can 't do anything and that 's why when the situation today we need to get a a more efficient way so that we can actually make some of these decisions and I think provides some of it that I 'm you know discretion and that 's what I really wanted staff to be able to have that discretion so they can actually talk to these individuals work out come up with a compromise solution that addresses the concern but I understand if so feel uncomfortable doing that so we have to do as counselors and I take on board that the staff had said that they will prepare reports to go to the committee and so I 'll be taking that opportunity up and we 'll see what happens as a result but I just think it 's incredibly important that we do this at the problem with having criteria is that by the time you write the criteria there 's always new criteria that should have been in the criteria and a whole bunch of reasons why people don 't don 't qualify so you just get this continuous cycle of work trying to redefine the criteria to fit the case if you don 't was a much more simple as to have a wider description but I appreciate if people feel uncomfortable doing that we 'll try the current policy and see if we can get action on that if we can 't we may need to come back okay can I put them it 's just a motion now can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried okay item 18 the report of the boot chairperson of the bill would picketed _"

    "text": "the next item on the agenda is the inspections and enforcement unit and the performance report 2013 and David East will move that and Thomas Kendra will second dirt are there any questions nanny um again in the paper today there 's concern about the asbestos and website do is there a need for us to do do you think further external investigations and thatís pistols I mean it seems like it 's whatever reasons the report said that there were quite the war processes in place and yeah so I just okay we haven 't_''_45.18 ordered recently back up through the Environmental Committee and on the work that 's being done around is bestest across the city a lot of it has been relieved by works a given that the lead regulator because a lot of this work is actually occurring within a complication or seating so we have just last week launched the asbestos aware which I 've electorally now just took of your heads up with it is coming so the campaign at the moment really is targeting DIY home renovations or repairs will pick one to know what they need to do how they need to manage that waste any move through it for for it part of the interagency group has been looking at the risks associated with asbestos and quite heavy and part of the email that I sent to you last week I just gave a a big rundown on what exactly is being done around asbestos so whilst we have a role to play in our unit around supporting asbestos and public places in giving great public advice and relation to how to manage asbestos the lead comes from WorkSafe so if we had concerns about work safe how would we actually address their concerns about work safe approach to asbestos of Europe I think you 'd go to work safe and nice those concerns and but as far as oh you know from a from a council staff point of view you think things have been handled well at the moment and it wouldn 't be really any ground raised from a council staff and point of view and you can see we 've had the asbestos the number of complaints inquiries that we 've had our still remain relatively low from the joint agency waste and environmental management team and the quarterly reporting that we do it through the Environmental Committee the complaints coming through those avenues remain relatively low WorkSafe end and our waste environmental management team have got edge or a number of and the thousands of joint agency and inspections this year so they 've got a joint work program so they 're looking at things like asbestos I off the top of my head on the number sixteen hundred they have got 1,600 site visits planned to do this year looking at things like asbestos silicon management health and safety restaurant sites and everything so there is a tremendous amount of work being done out and about in relation to SB stands in monitoring the environment in understanding of what is happening there just the final question on page 120 it says that there 's been 12 instances as vistas found in public places they consistent in roadways I was quite shocked to see that asbestos had been found at the Metro sports facility which is were able to occur and leave us business behind an important place learnings from how that 's happened so that going forward we don 't ever repeat so there CC DUI net site and the demolition was led by the amending contractor so a lot of the management of his pistols were in fact any hazardous material as often tied up and the contract and related to the demolition of that site so that you expect that due process is being followed in relation to how a contract unfolds in their contracts that I 've seen in know and understand of that are really detailed when it comes to addressing hazardous materials on site and how they must go through that process as you are aware you don 't need a demo shun consent for a building that 's less than three stories high in as freestanding so those mechanisms for what may have been seen historically is something that council might be looking at and there anymore so we don 't go and inspect we don 't there is no mechanism around consistent so did I understand that I again because what I can 't understand is how you get a major public new facility with a space das left after it 's demolished so do you think I mean I just can 't_''_297.669 yeah I 'm trying to understand the lessons from how that happened in put in place things that actually stop that happening going forward yes yeah so I don 't know is that through the confusing a requirement for consents would be a way to go if that 's see Usher board you 're asking a meal an opinion of something that actually I 'm not qualified to talk to what I can say is that following the Metro sports facility demolition in the issues that have been raised around SB stars with them dbh in other council the council had a council that was am involved in leasing net land for public car parking that they 've gone back and looked at the contracts to make sure are going to be much more fastidious in the contracts around how that is managed in the future particularly we are canceled as leasing the space to were utilizing the space for these staff so at some stage i can rosa offline but i would like to understand those 12 instances in what police ins learn from i can give you a classic example of one of those 12 incidents of monster a and it 's based on strove being replaced an industrial building and this is the kind of thing that happens often industrial building at and sock boon in was high winds in the material had been lifted off the top of that roof inn had been blown over a nearby building and had land and the straight nearby so that that 's the kind of things that we get involved in and it 's the kind of issues that we have in relation to asbestos but some of the complaints aren 't actually whilst they say there s bestest it 's not asbestos fan so somebody 's identified something falling off the back of a track or some hazardous material material that they believe as SB stars but isn 't actually when we go and investigate so it 's as though it 's little are made to us about I 've got David David and andrew is it right now and maybe how Christians in the bar pillow I 'm in le page 112 just the outcomes of them pounded dogs it doesn 't seem to be much of a trend in the sort of disposal of impounded dogs and those dogs more well obviously it would be on other and chip dogs that have to be otherwise you get them back your honor typically they are and actually there is a real trend and we disposed dogs this twenty-five percent less dogs disposed off in the last 12 months then lastly much compared to the year before only only a small yep but it 's still it 's still coming back because you 've also got to think that dogs have been kind of displaced are we inheriting a lot of ups and that sort of things that are on and microchipped and nice so where are these dogs coming from if they 're not marketed counselors a lot of these dogs team to come from other regions throughout the district it 's and a microchip and the council provide free microchipping in the city a lot of dogs that aren 't microchip throughout the rest of the regions that are close neighbors to us and they tend to come in on the odd occasion we pick them up as though wandering the street and as people find them and give them to us so that they 're not microchipped dolls are the the compliance of microchipping dogs and other areas is not as stringent as it is in the city because we provide a free service here so our immediate neighbors Selwyn and waimakariri don 't have microchipping yes they do but they don 't have a free service like we do therefore the compliance as encroached should have no reason not to have your dog microchipped it was free it 's not the same compliance or requirement and why macary for instance at least the local local authority was vigilant about making sure people did hear their dogs microchip well I just would have thought and in the Christchurch metropolitan area the requirement to dispose of dogs because of our microchipping or double-digit figures that 's what we 're certainly hoping for the next few years as dogs get older there should be there should be more dogs microchip and therefore less bolts going to shelters and less dobbs them what you still going to get people from other regions who bring them in that are still required to be marketed but and diligent in terms of making chicken that they are microchip okay look I 'm really sorry I 'm going to have to take the lunch adjournment and I 've got two more people we 're going to have to deal with this after lunch I do apologize who are the two others that are going to ask questions so and Ellie well hang on I have to close the meeting because I 've got two we 've got a meeting at 12 duty so that some of us have to attend so if they really can 't_''_621.279 be asked offline then okay so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and thank you for your tolerance and understanding I will adjourn until two o 'clock _"

    "text": "we have a part a measure construction site hoardings temper use of legal road fees rebates and there is a recommendation from staff with an amendment to substitute a hundred percent fifty percent but if that were if we were generally acceptable with that we could actually put that into the main resolution rather than deal with it by way of amendments so let 's just test the water first and see how people are feeling about the medications if I could call because pulls away at the moment are the chair of this committee is happy to seek in there you think well if you were happy to to second it why don 't we just make it the resolution of the the actual resolution that we 're considering so if we could just take the committee recommendation and change the word fifty percent to a hundred percent and we 'll have it move Jamie golf and seconded cool clear water and so now i will call the clear water but when our committee first look at that we thought fifty percent was pretty reasonable and the cost of i think the whole I 've had discussions with counts the golf and some others very briefly believe the whole point is to have this as a good as incentive as possible and if it 's up to a hundred percent and like if we can imagine how all the hoardings around the city will look and and this is for a considerable number of years in the future if in fact they are really great and if there are some neat things happening how God there will be and so I think to give every incentive to the businesses and the the developers who will have the hoardings and it I would stress it is up to one hundred percent and then we clear criteria is my understanding to actually achieve them so that 's why I 'm supporting that from what the committee decided oh good Jamie did you want to yeah I will so I 'm thanks for that feeling I appreciate your support with us look as we all know there are so many impediments to development here we don 't have development we don 't don 't we don 't have a rebuild and so often we 've seen this capital flight where financial advisors accountants bankers you 're saying do you know what there 's too much uncertainty there 's cost escalation there 's so many fees take the tangible return the rate of return that exists an existing building put it into austin texas put into wellington put into melbourne their three real life examples that have happened in this city from born bred can tabs that have had an insurance payout and they 've put it offshore i sit around this table because i want everyone to love christ church as much as me and i want it to end up that city that I know it can be but that 's only going to happen people backing this city the reality is with the with the hoardings occupational health and safety requires the defense is erected when you construct a building the city plan requires that you be able to the frontage so automatically is going to some encroachment on the footpath now the these pieces of regulation were put into I think it 's a very different environment now now you 've got two options do you want to have the cheap and dirty fencing the hurricane fencing that goes up there would you like to say to these people you know what we understand that it 's challenging time but we really supportive of you putting the investment back into Christchurch and if we have the entire city that has hoardings around there which is providing safety for the public but looks attractive and creates a little piece of artwork on every corner I think that 's fantastic I 've spoken the staff I 've spoken with the general manager it 's something they 're supportive of and it is workable for a small fee it 's a really good outcome because the reality is we are going to be a city that is a construction site for for a long time to come so I think it 's a positive outcome to our not punish the people that we really really want to help there are so many reasons why not to do things so to be able for this and for doing the right thing will actually the party I think it 's a good signal to send front from our counselor so that 's why I proposed this I 'm really thankful together the cheers support and hope I can count on you Yanni term gleam yeah so um this is obviously budgeted we put in place a quantum in the budget so there 's a hundred thousand dollars per year unbudgeted expenditure is that correct but the cost of the up to fifty percent was approximately a hundred thousand per year if we go up to a hundred percent that 'll be two hundred thousand but in talking with counselor golf and counselor clearwater the value of what we would get back for that and well i can 't_''_299.26 put a dollar value on it and i think what we 're hearing is its enhancing the central city and it would be money well for gone so what 's the cost of doing it for the entire city rather than just the central city because I 'd I from mammoth I 'd have to be we did put boundaries around 6.4 says columbine courting projects with fun day streets with Arnold bounding aphidicolin water for hours in a speed zone as defined by the accessible City tonight so and we were just looking that 's our staff recommendation that we put a boundary on it and it 's also time bound 22 jun 2015 alright so so i guess my question really is um understand the incentive aspect collar can 't understand why would only do it in the central city where we 're spending a huge amount of money on transitional projects and not do it in the suburbs where we 've got you know I commend the people at number would recently have done a fantastic mural it just adds so much so can I move an amendment or can I ask staff or the committee whether they would consider this issue and can we extend it to include the old city I think we 'd have to like to be further costings of the sixth end of the whole city and that would need to come back to the committee level so the committee that were okay anyway would be obviously a lot further costs and the committee hadn 't agreed on there yeah I i agree with yanni I personally I would like the supply to the whole city I don 't think now 's the time to do that has been a big piece of work I 'm not on this committee it 's gone through a committee process I made an amendment you know I I picked a battle that was winnable in this instance because we 've got something in front of us and the works been done I would really urge perhaps in addition to that that a report comes back on the feasibility that 's standing this yep to the entire city yeah I 've also got one other comment that I 'd like to make as well because I think it 's important to counting or can I can i clarify that that it already applies to all of the city what they must had heritage building is that right or is that only within those spaces it 's tough verification on me so um it was a separate one hundred percent permitted and the case were listed it wouldn 't make sense to only have there yep covering the central city so would it be possible just off what yani was saying to say in addition what one more point that staff report back on the feasibility of applying the rebate citywide because I think that that would be a really positive signal seen a night and I would support it I just want to add one thing as well this is also with it being cost neutral I do want to stress there 's up to one hundred percent so the cause of pays when they 're H when the counselors you losing a revenue stream they can recoup it and I 'm pretty intend that if you have three council car parks for instance that are going to go for a period of time due to these hoardings being over there charge them for it it 's a real source of revenue which the counselors losing so you can recoup that traffic management plan needs to be implemented recoup those costs but just following the law then I think it does make sense to offer the rebate so it can because usually the cost can be recovered but i think it 's positive to have that final point that stuff report back to apply the citywide I 'd like to get this through today but neat step would ideally be to apply this to the whole understanding from the annual plan we asked for a report to come back around rates remission for vacant sites that enabled transitional users projects etc as it seems about all that this has done separately from that but as that week actually happening and is there a time frame for that report to come back because other I mean maybe it could just be added to that report rather than a whole new report so that we actually look holistically at this issue I 'll have to follow up and find out the timing on the ritz remission report but i 'd suggest it probably fits better doing it as a separate report to tighten with this rather than a reached remission and unless they had fenced with a an attractive hoarding I mean I just I noticed going by the Art Center for example there that since they 've put you know the images of what they 're doing and you know I mean I seek tourists taking photographs of the photographs of what 's going on there because it is the most extraordinary project it so it 's of world status you know what they 're doing this so there are amazing stories to be told and they should be told while the rebuilds heck no and I just don 't know mr. language for another three months around the rest of the city I think that which should be pretty straightforward is any reason s quebec the committee or it couldn 't come back to council well I think of some Jane Power has indicated the the vacant sites and rates remission is like a separate issue this is a rip this is around the hoardings and incentives to to have them decorative so it 's a separate issue a year no yes yes but I think we 're all accepted that that the your committee to consider that issue and report to us on that so we 're going to add that to the resolution a separate separate matter and that staff report to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee on the on on the insights on on rates r emotions for vacancies yeah but I see if you give a blanket rates from ocean then I 'm afraid a blanket site does nothing for the people of Christ eh I was saying but for the use of transitional mahadji yeah that 's right I don 't even think it needs to go back to the committee it was an annual plan resolution that Jamie moved and we heard from get Phillip and so it 's a piece of work that 's already in trying this probably a resolution on the box to actually do it well I 'm saying is I think it 's great that this has come but I think we also need to make sure that that is actually progressing at the same time because it 's equally as important but just in terms of the issue today around that hole they can citrate remission etc because we 've already got one just for today I I do not understand the logic of putting a report bit to the committee around extending this to the whole city ya know if it 's very bigger can we have some struggling accounts yeah they 'd staff report bank accounts to the next council meeting was it yeah yeah I mean it 's feasible the next council meeting on the feasibility of applying the rebate don 't you know it 's it 's a it 's a cost analysis that 's all we 're asking for I think we all understand the benefits right who else did I have Tim and Glenn I 'm totally and support of the Sun as long as the Barrett 100 was seen has kicked very high because not everyone will go to that level so therefore there will always be some form of revenue but the true cost as if we don 't do it because that we 've got some big events happening international events next year to add such life and vibrancy to absolutely amazing we could even become a life of a sign and hit enter company competitions I mean it would be absolutely brilliant if there happened the opportunity for our local artists we could even discover another banksy we 've probably got a few but to just give them some legal place to practice their art form would be absolutely wonderful and even competitions I mean look at get full on what they did and those vacant spaces so on their hoardings that could be absolutely fantastic and as I said the real cost as if we don 't open air up minds in and look at positively positively doing this so I 'm really in favor of this but I do want to stress I want to set the bar at one hundred percent high because I think the potential is fantastic and thanks Jamie thank you you some supportive especially with 6.2 I think we need to break through that kind of structural disconnect where we were only given the CBD to their part of offering a planet 's about a whole city but my questions about the revenue because there 's more recordings go up obviously this is greater revenue so I know it 's not really splitting he is it actually a loss of revenue rather than yep okay heavy to support great so Yanni I yeah I totally understand why you did this and I do think it makes a lot of sense I think we also as a council need to think about how we actually display on our sites that we 're working on because I think we could probably improve and if we 're going people revert to do it on there 's less us actually they be better in there in that space as well I think you know I appreciate that there 's some revenue issues so we need another report coming back to Council I would have liked to extend it beyond the central city they I just can see no reason why the central city should be any different and again i invite you to drive past east gate and look at the mural that 's gone up on the corner now that one 's probably all on can see what an impact of makes having those nice colorful art works and the in the suburbs so really strongly support this I do think we need to follow up urgently around annual plan resolutions around the rates remissions and also you know the other issue which we need to address at some point is when people are demolishing or constructing the damage that 's done the footpaths and what is that actually quality of things going back so casual street with a transitional cathedral is if you look at my dress straight there 's hole cut ways through the footpath that don 't make it a very accessible City that actually do a lot of damage and the footpaths are just lived in a really really poor state after all the demolition has been done so i think terms absolutely right we need to get the study looking really good for you know for our citizens for their spirits and also for the the showcase that we 're going to have next year and you know hopefully some Christmas decorations will go up on some of these so really great idea and I you know I think a committee for the recommendations good all right I 'll pop the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie _"

    "text": "cute presentation no I don 't look into presentation of petitions I 'm young deputations understanding order three point 19 1 deputation make more and Debbie Morris speaking to item 11 flooding issues at North halls wall I can see Mike Morris here as Debbie not coming when that matter came up inside the tipster but anyway she didn 't want to speak she 's quite happy for me to speak on this issue ok i 'm thinking meet Amir and counsel Lewis the concern that dome that we have with the meadowlands development that if North halls will is the ability for for Henderson 's basin to to sustain more and more stormwater discharges there 's a report that the Debbie seed around last night that actually highlights quite a lot of the issues that other property owners in the area have with with the ability of their area to absorb more and more storm water is pushing the issue further out it 's like traffic parking restrictions you impose them on an area and then it just pushes the problem somewhere else Henderson 's Basin this a.m as thousands of years and what we 're doing is we 're putting more and more and more water into that area hoping that it will stop the herb stop flooding if the of the heskett river but it is it 's the ground the ground water is some level as is above ground plays as most of the time would near enough to most of the time now so its ability to actually absorb more stormwater that will be discharged from another 70 odd hectares of the presidential term and commune development is in in our opinion the very suspect and I just would like to refer to the natural hazard section of the of the revised city plan with the draft at city plan and that 's policy five point three point three protection the flood storage and overflow areas and its ears I quote and the policy is to maintain flood storage capacity and function of natural flood plains wetlands and ponding areas etc and limited filling in herbal and urban areas at risk of flooding in a major flood event where that filling activity could transfer the the concern that that we have with Henderson 's basin and there 's a lot of reports around meta mirren capsule laws that went back they concerned and I know it 's very easy for us not very easy but I know there are people out there that will say well here if you digger if you dig a hole in that pond area big enough to actually take a 1 in 50 year flood well then that 's fine but it 's not actually solving the problem because the water can 't actually go anywhere because the ground waters already just it 's that high that your ground level the ground water if it 's not up above there it 's here so the ability for that to happen and I would seriously challenged in that area I really would experts can say that you can take it down two or three meters dig a hole two or three meters but you 're only digging a hole into water the ability for that to actually spread out and absorb more storm water and you wouldn 't have to be if we 're trying to stop flows increasing into kashmir stream and into the river well in that is the ability or the lack of opportunity to storm or storm water and all and henderson 's basin is going to be automatically transferred directly into the healthcare river and i know there was plenty around a while ago to actually turn that into a flat water recreational facility but that opportunity was lost that could have actually maybe increase the capacity but what we 're really concerned about is it is a natural wetland and thank goodness people had the four select the sea and stop the development of Travis Travis some swampy area the residential development into their internet and return that to a natural wetland which is absolutely the correct thing to do and that 's what really what we 'd like to see happen in the Hendersons Basin area rather than be reactive and when we find that hey the system doesn 't work and i don 't think in the modeling that 's been done i really don 't think there 's been enough and I they 're not really and catering for the for climate change and the effects of that the Hendersons Basin area for those who don 't really know it there well all the drainage swales and systems in the west of christ church or the southwest of christ you it 's virtually flow east indian Dyson 's basin you 've got the port hills and the runoff from the port hills coming down to the kashmir stream so you 've got on one side you 've got all storm water catchments feeding in that direction towards henderson 's basin and you 've got the the watershed from the port hills coming down there as well and i 've driven around there meta mirren capsules and heavy rainfall events and found the flooding that is happening and I 'm talking about torrents running across the road absolute torrents scaring out scaring out and scaring her so I 'm just really concerned and and would like to maybe suggest that because i don 't see that he can have been a party to any discussions about about this plan change 68 69 and serious consultation with Environment Canterbury about the effects of development over seventy five hectares of land and the repercussions of that along with the ability and the sustainability of Henderson 's Basin to keep absorbing more and more and more stormwater discharges other storm water systems work quite well we 've got free running shingle underneath and low ground water tables and that 's that 's an excellent system that 's working Christchurch for many many years but in this particular occasion the ability for that storm water to actually drained the ground there 's not feasible because it can 't happen because the water tables already high so without wasting any more time and met a mirror and counselors I just like to raise that that we I think that we would agree with the recommendation that the report be received and that be passed under the community board and made available for the public to have a look at but I do is that bank consultation with the Environment Canterbury on their on this the effects of this large-scale residential and commercial development on that block of land to continue to absorb more and more water thank you happy to answer any questions thank you so on four point fifteen of the of the port where it talks about the fact that this development will be required to capture all of the runoff from their development area and manage it appropriately within their own system yes be required to mitigate the stormwater runoff from their development in accordance with the council 's own southwest area your storm water management plan need to manage groundwater by installing sub soil drainage in order to install and operate underground utilities and mitigate the perfection requests Rick risk be required to provide compensation storage for any lost blood volume due to filling and the basin be required to ensure their final worth works do not adversely affect the natural land drainage patterns of neighboring properties how does that not address the community for luxuries it does virtually but i 'm just still concerned about the ability for that to actually happen in practice so you did you 're just not confident that the group that 's getting their consent to do this consent well I 'm just concerned that storm water issues are compounding in this area and I 'm well aware the fact that the City Council of had to go and boy over over the last ten years huge areas of land in Henderson 's Basin to turn them into storm water retention areas at the rate payers expense to mitigate the effects of underdeveloped storm water systems that have been these conditions put on them but the other ones would have had those conditions put on them as well Madame mayor and council that but I am really pleased to see that that as a condition but I 'm just really concerned that it won 't have the ability to actually do that I felt clear watering and mother just want to clarify over going on formation you sent its like the information you 've got from mr. Louis yes which is relation to concede in fact well he is a lot easier a local resident I understand it he does not have engineering qualifications will qualify him but he does refer to a lot of information in there just one through the common question really is that from the staff report in fact the mitigation features which are going to be would be required the staff call me really is that that would improve the drainage of the area it will be actually drain better than the original pepino grassland area below and i hope i really do sincerely hope that that 's correct but I 've seen fall sponges and you can 't put any more of water end of a sponge that 's full all right I 'm sorry that 's enough time for questions I apologize i 'm the i 'm just wondering that if council would like to deal with the paper now rather than wait till later on so we 'll move to the paper but thank you Michael you can return to your seat thank you very much could we have _"

Albans and I think as everyone we put across that they 're looking for a multi-use facility I 'm obviously to eventually replace the transitional one that we currently have it said on would that go on the old side there 's a discussion we needed to have I guess what the community we have the best place to put there and look at the land that is council-owned yeah I haven 't even looked at it but is it I mean is it still standing is it repairable or is known as if all gone it 's demolished demolished has got transitional cinder on there at the moment there 's been given but the transitional centers drive by the earth so often an it did here that looks quite good but it 's just it 's one room really right so it 's not really a community scene unit it 's more of a meeting meeting room that eternity said is more of a meeting it was busy all the time there was just stuff going on in all the different rooms and I think that 's what the community is saying they want to have bag yep and and what the board is seeing is that the council owns two sites there it might be worth having a conversation about whether we just use one or what but we need to hear back but if I could just say that time and again the community keeps coming back and saying what 's happened to that 3.6 million that was allocated to that community center when it was still standing before the earthquakes to upgrade it and the council got all the plans done and everything and purchased extra property now I know the money is gone but can we get something some official notification to the community board about that just so the money that you know it 's gone whatever but we need something you know definite to tell them so this was prior to 2018 so it was on the 2009 2008 it was a like 2010 actually if my name receives me well maybe fevery 2010 resolution okay okay so that the report be received and that the and that staff update the community board with information about the historic plans to bother about earlier plans to upgrade the facility on colombo street on colombo street in and what happened to the funding set aside to that it was 3.6 million dollars I know I my book it all worlds it I know okay it doesn 't come up all the time comes up this is ok I guess yes those come on and how and how the well yeah and how the commitment of funds to the council budget was well no was well with it was was removed I mean like it was was addressed why don 't we put was addressed and then then we can find out the detail don 't you want to know mean you can look back but the really simple answer is council didn 't put it on the budget of the annual plan posted earthquake because it was a transitional facility idiot that 's not I mean the case what is playing in touch wit ya okay and and then there 's a community board is working on the future was there that there is a future been claimed which has got no relationship to that I think that the community kind of want to have closure on on on what happened is this inherit happen and we can get them that information I think one of the biggest problem because because we 've got a transitional Center people forget that it is transitional so we need to look for the future and work out what we 're going to do and not just focus on what we 've got at the moment what is going to obviously go eventually yeah all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you it 's very useful thinking and spread and haircut _"
