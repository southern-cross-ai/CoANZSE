CEO Madame au series deferred business and if you will that post and after the budget matters thank you item 4 counselor reports councillor ratinho thanks madam mayor um I just have a couple of quick items to speak about both relating to education opportunities in the Ayrshire recently had an update meeting with the gifts a nice study hub and met with Joanne 's Gamal who 's the higher education study hub program coordinator she 's been employed as a coordinator for this project located at our community hub the stakeholders in the hub of Jane Ponting an and the Galan network or the Gippsland East local learning unemployment Network TAFE Gippsland East Gippsland Shyam Federation University the meeting at the hub discussed update on on the hub and it was an opportunity to see exactly the progress is being made ready for the opening of the study hub to students the hub will provide high speed internet video conferencing and student support making it possible for students to access University locally by supported distance education the hub will make use of the latest technology so that students who cannot relocate for whatever reason have the flexibility to study project that were seen in Coomer called the country University Center the Gippsland East University study hub will provide and have a presence also in Wellington and be open for business next semester the facility will be providing tertiary costs including postgraduate courses social learning external examination study support and outreach service options for Omiya or boss mallacoota and Yaron for the Wellington East Gippsland has one of the lowest university participation rates in Victoria which is largely due to affordability the second item again was that education theme was Federation University had a stakeholder engagement meeting in band style and lead Kennedy the new head of campus for Federation University Gippsland conducted the event the event provided Federation University was an opportunity to share information regarding the development of a number of significant health sector initiatives including the delivery of occupational therapy and physiotherapy courses and the Federation Business School MBA locally here in Gippsland the university explained to stakeholders on how the Uni is willing to work with regional stakeholders especially organisations and industry to enhance future education intern employment opportunity prospects for our region Fed journey is time in its history a residential scholarship program for disadvantaged students from our region it was a shame that were only representatives from only two of the secondary colleges there because I think this is something that all our show should be interested in and hear about students being able to attend University through one of these scholarship programs I did have it put to me and to our group that local government has nothing to do with education or shouldn 't be in that space and whilst we don 't deliver education firsthand we certainly should be encouraging and enabling this as enabler for our region so thank you madam e thanks counselor retainer councillor Reeves thanks mayor good afternoon everyone councillors and all our visitors in the gallery my report is dominated by our time at the Elgar Australian Local Government Association National General Assembly last week I 've written a long report four or five pages and thankfully for everybody here I 'm not going to read it but I 'm going to draw out three main points that I think are important one was the launch brain from national economics and I have a copy here to make sure that we have available for other councillors but is that the sort of thing that we can put in our libraries too mr. CEO this is incredibly important data in terms of how we 're placed in the national economic setting demographics what are the issues that face us what are the challenges and also what are the some of the solutions it 's very important was presented by praetor brain who I from national economics who I can only describe as a left brain savant and the graphs and tables in there were just incredible incredible data and very important for us especially considering what we 're talking about later in the meeting today the second point I 'm going to draw out he 's the CEO of infrastructure Australia Romney made you noted sagely around infrastructure investment being a long-term benefit to the community and that was evidenced by the infrastructure Australia ordered and she talked in particular about regional infrastructure and drew reference to the rate kept and she described agitated environments like New twenty years probably even longer mr. CEO from memory maybe 20 or 30 years and the issues around the effects on facilities and infrastructure that never get caught up with in a rate kept environment and there 's a lot of evidence around the hollowing out of communities not just infrastructure but social infrastructure and removing the opportunities and the reasons for people to invest and live in an area when there might be not so much a job issue but a skills issue and that creates the likes of FIFO workers and that leads that further spiraling down of a local place a local the government area like ourselves very important to note that the last thing that I 'm going to draw out this is in particular and regarding to young people and youth we had a presentation from John Silverson from Rio Kovac University in Iceland some of you might have heard him on radio national this morning incredible the work that they 've done over the last 20 years in reducing drug alcohol and other risk behaviors of young people in Iceland using a planet youth four prong focus on well-being peer support family commitment and extracurricular activities and the effects have just been amazing in terms of the reduction in youth risk behavior promiscuity smoking drug and alcohol abuse and the consequent benefits to the community about investing in that and I was just delighted to hear this morning again on radio National when John dr. John was interviewed that there are about half a dozen or more local government organizations across Australia that are picking up that and a youth program to target that particular issue it might be something we can consider in future but my my report as I say four or five pages I will table and enable us arm to be read later thank you thanks Council arrays councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor unfortunately didn 't bring anything for show-and-tell or any graphs I 'll just I 'll just highlight a couple of the the events that I attended this month the first one is the 2019 a regional land care dinner I attended the regional land care dinner and a part of the night 's proceedings was a various Landcare groups the films portrayed excellent and invaluable work that is undertaken by volunteers across the community revegetation creating wildlife corridors removing invasive plants and many other essential works not only t has had an excellent effect on the landscape visually but has also seen a significant increase in native and rare and threatened species I 'd like to commend the work that Lang care doesn 't look forward to seeing the results in the future last night I attended the champions for change dinner with keynote keynote sperm doctor Michael flood champions for changes in it is an initiative that aims to raise awareness around family violence and assisting people to speak up against that kind of behavior the evening was well attended and the presentation by dr. flood was very informative and encouraged some pertinent discussion with some excellent questions asked by the audience the evening concluded with a stand-up comedy routine from Greg flea you might know him from neighbors and the Umbra International Comedy Festival and whole bunch his routine touched on some difficult issues but there were a few shot shot gasps but was went maybe a few areas that he thought might have been a little bit ironic that maybe wasn 't quite the audience that he was aiming for but a very good evening thank you thanks councillor Roberts councillor Buckley thank you madam me on the evening of the 20th of June I had the pleasure to welcome professor Bradley Turner head of the motor neuron disease lab at the University of Melbourne to a dinner and a presentation at the band-style RSL an honored guest was Tony orchard who lives nearby at benamber and has struggled with the disease for many years professor Turner 's good news was that within ten years we can be well on the way to a cure for MMD the dinner and the presentation was hosted by D in a wheel club of band style and good on them thank you madam me thanks counselor Buckley accounts for Ellis thank you madam mayor I 'll keep mine very short another busy month a couple of points to make note off were I also attended the Olga conference and I won 't take any of the note that I also was in tenants and took on board many of the matters discussed on a national basis I attended the launch of these gifts and business awards party in a strategic visitor around my hometown of likes entrants attended them marina consultative committee meetings attended the national timber councils association meeting recently and finally attended yesterday the cubes land climate change Network and disability advisory committees meetings held here in Bend style our supplier written report to CEOs executive thank you thanks counselor Ellis counselor what better man there 's been quite a busy month for me as well particularly as its involved many changeover dinners for our one service clubs rotary and lions one of those was Mitchell River rotary and Bernie Farquhar has been has taken on the president 's role this year and what was interesting is that they do they do pick a project that will be there their aim for the year and Bernie has chosen the water tower as a project so he quickly looked at me expecting some support from Council and I said ah sorry Bernie not ours it in the world with his endeavors to possibly get some murals painted on it so good luck to him in that in that pursuit now the on Friday during the 14th they attended the opening that Darren Chester opened Stage three of Gippsland rotary centenary house down near the Terrell burn hospital and that 's quite a quite a great facility providing accommodation for those people who have loved ones who were ill in hospital but have to travel large distances and this is accommodation at a very good rate for those families to be near their loved ones interestingly what came from that is that much of the money has been provided by people in Latrobe Valley and neighboring shires but they Skip 's man who has also provided some funding has the 55 percent occupancy rate so it 's well used by yusuke planners obviously for the remote the fact that we are remote from Terrell burn hospital and it 's great to see that that facility is benefiting the Ayrshire on the same day well even Inc traveled to to Melbourne for the Aquatic and recreation Victoria died whose trainer at Lakes Aquadome was nominated but failed to to win unfortunately but it was still great that we got that nomination but the great news was that the cost outdoor pool picked up a prize for for their initiative and what they 've done with regards to the pool up there it was some it needed some maintenance which required emptying the pool in the middle of summer in the middle of a very severe drought and it was great to to know that valuable staff showed some great initiative in first of all wondering why they should dip that water down the storm water drains when the farmers were growing out for water and so they they thought outside the square and showed showed great initiative got got volunteers to to come forward they got the water tested to find it was safe to allow livestock to drink drink it and then using volunteers and tankers they proceeded to deliver that to as many farms that were serviced so that got them their nomination and what was absolutely great on the night was that that we with me after the event no hundreds of people there and was explaining why these gifts landed one and it was for that compassion that was shown because they 're up against some pretty stiff competition which was you know large augers are organizations and who were doing a great job but this almost outdoor pool they just explained that that was that was the clincher was what they did in their thoughts for the rest of their community it was almost time we were late in the evening with that award and it was almost time for them to announce the winners when Kelly said to me across the table and I thought I 'd been sent down there 's a chaperon for the for the staff she said if we win you need to make a speech I said what speech she said didn 't they write one for you I said no and yes we got called out so I said okay girls up to the stage you 've got to come with me so what up and said a few words in front of all those one with all the knowledge on this and I think she should explain and speak to the crowd which she reluctantly did but what was so funny was that I stepped back away from the microphone and she stepped forward and her knees were knocking together she did a great job but she was absolutely petrified so I thought well you threw me under the bus well it 's my turn and yes and just lastly on the service clubs the 17th of June I mean no lines was one that was close to home for me that they had their changeover dinner and it was pleasing to note once again that their field day if it had been most successful and that they were quite appreciative of the fact that the the gate was lowered for as a result of the drought that the gate fee and that so many people attended they couldn 't believe the attendance during such a bad so he 's not so one that 's my lot for the month thank you thanks counselor white councillor pouts thank you madam mayor I just like in camber I headed to Melbourne to the mov transport infrastructure meeting last week and we had two successful opportunities rise from that and it was with regards to unanimous support to write to the Minister of Transport to get the engineers of regional roads Victorian I think most of the community will be pleased to hear this but we got up that we would write to the minister in review the big roads would review their engineering designs for the roundabouts specifications and in particular we were hearing from people up in Swan Hill who 'd had a roundabout built just over there the causeway near a bridge there that they 're upgrading and I said well how did you go with your round about and they said so no more and I said I 'm hearing you I know exactly what you mean in particular the Stratford breed Stratford roundabout as you go over just before you go over the bridge whilst it 's not in our Shire most people travelling to Melbourne or for services further down that way have encountered it and the initial westbound diversion a need for the minister to address big road specifications because when we actually chatted to regional roads Victoria about it they all just said it was built to engineers specifications well in real light the specifications aren 't realistic to their road users and with us the minister on behalf of this group to have them look into it and to address it accordingly issues that arise from it our twisting vehicles the main chassis czar getting damaged underneath there 's possible rollover issues and other than that it was designed to slow the speed down yes it 's done that but there 's also other implications with regards to the final construction of it so with that said we also address them in regards to the wayside stops regional roads Victoria has a policy that all exits from wayside stops need to be merged back on to the main carriage right way at a right angle to the main road the main carriageway which we felt is not progressive a more satisfactory use of this would be emerging a progressive merging Lane given the fact that on in 're merging onto a road where cars are driving at a hundred kilometers an hour and if you 're moving out onto a carriageway at twenty kilometres an hour there 's issues safety issues with regards to having to slow traffic down and to actually get on the carriageway so progressive merging lanes exiting wayside stops has been requested on our community 's behalf and finally the last thing that was brought up there was about the safety guards and there was much discussion in regards to how it is affecting our community and they also did state that with any of the guards that have been damaged that the funding is actually coming out of road maintenance use to repair these guard railings which was never discussed right at the start whilst they 're an initiative from the TAC bucket of funding the repairs to any of these guards which are being hit and damaged is actually coming out of the maintenance budget of regional roads Victoria which then comes out of the slush fund that actually is resurfacing our roads so it 's it 's not actually justified than that bubbling around in the background there 's many reports being written at the in the moment and we 'll see a bit of a change in place by the end of the year so thank you madam an that was all I had to discuss thanks counselor pouts and just okay for mine quite short I was also in Algar with my fellow councillors and the CEO also attended the official opening of the 2019 snow season at Mount Hotham and last Thursday I met with the Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormick who was also also acting prime minister at the time he 's the Minister for infrastructure transport and regional development and our local member Darren tester with other council staff and mayor 's from Wellington and Latrobe Shire to talk about sort of Kipps lands infrastructure needs main items on the agenda were the duplication of the princess highway and the Gippsland rail line regional airports and connectivity and tourism specifically from East Gippsland priorities around our pence daily Airport strategy timber bridge and roads and as well as our sporting and recreational facilities and I of the draft revised council plan 2017 to 2021 and I 'll ask mr. David Radford to come forward and present thanks madam errand good afternoon counselors counselors the council plan expresses this councils broad vision for the East Gippsland Shire and gives a clear direction to the organization about specific outcomes for the term of this council and how they will be funded as well as having to develop a plan council is also required under the Act to review its council plan each year to determine if it requires any adjustment its counselors will recall a revision process was commenced earlier this year and is involved workshops with council senior offices and of course a community consultation process as a result of the public consultation process 9 submissions were received and upon review by council offices these submissions were deemed to be more aligned with the revised draft budget and as such were considered by the committee of council in accordance with the section 2 to 3 of the Act so due to no direct submissions being received regarding the council plan revision no further changes were recommended consultation process Council is now in a position to consider adopting these documents the council plan and the strategic resource plan councillors you have some recommendations before you happy to answer any questions thanks mr. Radford are there any questions councillors yes councillor Buckley I would like to be able to get a small retraction in one paragraph out of this so how do I go about that can I do it with moving a motion to accept the recommendation with the retraction of paragraph one what 's the procedure which paragraph are you referring to in our vision of these Gippsland I 'm referring to these Gippsland is the most livable region in Australia and anyway one of our counselors just mentioned before that there are attendants two universities in this area are largely down a big large will be caused by affordability and so it 's obviously that 's that 's a you might not call it a lie but it 's definitely a field they 're not like that removed so I 'd like to go and know the procedure that I must take mr. Radford he as well as the the overall content of the document the vision that was initially developed in the council plan that was adopted by this council back in 2017 was part of the revision process earlier this year so counselors certainly had the opportunity at that point to make any adjustments to the vision well I 'm afraid under those circumstances yeah councillor Buckley the through you madam mayor Councillor Buckley the vision hasn 't changed since the council plan was developed in 2017 and annually we have been through this process as a requirement of the Act to adjust not only the the council 's vision but any of these strategic objectives contained within the document considering that the workshopping process I believe commenced in February this year it would be my observation that there 's been ample opportunity to to look at the vision well thank you mr. Bradford under those circumstances I 'm afraid I won 't be able to support it Thank You counsel Alice did you have a question no I think mr. Bradford and I 've provided the assistance I was going to offer I have a seconder thanks counselor Reeves council parts do you wish to speak to the motion this document is of the base of counsel basically it 's a guideline of what we need to stick to and with regards to councilor Buckley 's comments I think you know we have with reiterating mr. Radford 's comments we have had a lot of time working on this and you 'll be able to change it come this time next year if if you so wish to do so the wording but at the last minute at this late hour it 's probably unsuitable and I might be surprised if you 've got support around the table but you may do and it 's something that is like the Bible for council and it has all of our ins and outs in it so I 'm I commend the staff and I think mr. Radford for his work on this document and his staff as well thank you thanks councillor pouts councillor Ray 's you wish to speak yeah thanks Mia thanks councillors mr. Radford thank you for your work over today I think it 's most appropriate that our vision is to be the most livable region in Australia I think that 's an aspirational statement it 's where we aim for it 's what we want to be we understand our there are some challenges around university completion school attendance jobs and goodness only knows what else are the challenges but unless we have a vision unless we can close our eyes and envisaged what we want to be in the future we 're never going to have that place to go to and the council plan is the document that takes us to that place provides a structure to take us on that journey to that place the other transactional matters that we 'll discuss today are how we take those steps to scaffold our way along that that journey to that vision but it 's absolutely appropriate that we have a vision to be the most livable region in Australia and I commend this and hope you all support it thanks councillor race are there any further speakers you can speak against the information yeah I 'm I covered it very briefly before but it 's as simple as that we shouldn 't put out stuff that 's not true and well I suppose in speaking against it that 's my strong logic so thank you madam me I think it 's council Buckley further speakers for against council pelts do you wish to have a right of reply oh yes I just like to say I concur with my fellow colleague councillor Reeves here to have a vision statement in a direction it 's vitally important to our our community and also to the staff here that runs the operation in council I 'd just like to say again and reiterate over the the what is it two years since these councils been sitting we 're now in our third year we came up with this probably three years ago and I think at that stage maybe there should have been some tweaking and like I said before they 'll be if you wish to tweak the wording councillor Buckley come January February March this next year 2020 there 'll be opportunity for that but um the background to this guiding pace so with that said again mr. Radford to you and your diligent staff committed to delivering this every year to us you 've done a sensational job and I 'd like to thank you you 'll be half of this council thanks counselor pouts I put the motion to you all those in favor against motion carried 71 item 5.1 point to adoption of revised draft Council budget miss Lee 's Collins thank you madam mere the revised draft budget 2019-20 presented to this meeting of council has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Act of 1989 and the local government planning and reporting regulations 2014 the revised draft budget adopted by council on the 7th of May 2019 for releasing the public submissions has been amended to take into account a number of items that were unknown at that time a list of the amendments has been attached to the council report which provides details of these changes one of the most significant amendments relates to the advance payment of 7.75 1 million of the 2019 20 Victoria 2018 19 year and is now included in the forecast operating result for the 2018 19 year this has increased the forecast surplus in the 1819 year and together with other forecast changes now estimates the operating surplus in the current year to be approximately 11 point 1 million dollars and the surplus that is now forecast in the revised draft budget before you for the 1920 year will be reduced to seven point zero 1 million dollars other material changes relate to the capital works program where council received advice of fixing country roads funding and a number of other capital grants a review of the expected capital works and landfill rehabilitation programs carried forwards for incomplete works from the 1819 program was also undertaken and the capital works and landfill rehabilitation programs were amended by just over five million dollars as a result of that review the timing of funding for some projects together with required approvals for landfill rehabilitation projects has seen the expected delivery of a number of projects being moved into the 2019 20 year other amendments were made to the 2018 19 operating forecasts some capital grant funding would be received and this together with other minor amendments accounted for the balance of the changes to both the 2018 19 forecast results and the 2019 20 budget also to know is that following consideration by a committee of Council of the 46 budget submissions received no recommendations for amendment of the revised draft budget were made by the committee a summary of the budget submissions and the recommendations of the committee of Council are included as an appendix to this report further there was one budget submission that had not been included in the budget submission hearing and that has been circulated to committee members for their consideration the submission related to a suggestion the council allocated funds specifically for a yearly planting of trees that consideration has recommended no amendment to the revised draft budget 1920 the budget before council this afternoon supports maintaining and improving services and infrastructure as well as delivering projects and services that are valued by our community all within the confines of the rate increase of two and a half percent on base rates a municipal charge mandated surplus of 7.01 million will be achieved for the 2019 20 year when taking into account one-off capital income items it is expected than an adjusted underlying deficit of two point four five seven million dollars will result due to the seven point seven million of the advance payment of the 1920 Grants Commission if the Victorian Grants Commission payment had been saved in the year to which it relates which is the 1920 year rather than in advance and adjusted our underlying surplus of 5.29 four million would have resulted the underlying surplus is a significant measure of councils ability to manage and deliver services within the confines of income sources that will continue consistently from year to year CalSTRS council seeks to achieve an underlying surplus of at least 1 million dollars every year and this result is therefore meeting this important financial sustainability measure further when taking a longer-term view of operating surpluses and underlying services estimated for the four years of the strategic resource plan all of the other three years being Twenty twenty one to twenty two twenty three are expected to show an operating capital major works a significant program of capital works totaling 45 point 6 to 6 million is preferred proposed for 2019 20 with an average capital works program over the next four years being thirty five point seven million major landfill rehabilitation projects are also planned over the coming four years totaling 12 point two million dollars with an average of just over three million dollars each year councils interview cash position is expected to average approximately seventeen point five million over the four years of the strategic resource plan after taking into consideration the amount of cash that is required to be held to fund day-to-day operations of council and amounts held in statutory reserves the under the unrestricted cash available shows that it will meet councils day-to-day cash requirements as well as being able to plan for future major project cash requirements such as the roman island ferry replacement council is a budget the budget report presented today includes a number of recommendations in relation to the adoption of the budget for councils consideration thank you madam me thanks miss Collins questions councillor pelts yes miss Collins would that council this councils trying to achieve if you could explain that a bit good please thank you Thank You councillor pals the revised draft budget proposes that the municipal charge be reduced from what was 18 percent of our total rates of municipal charge down to 14 percent of our total rates of municipal charge and what that does it redistributes the reduction being raised from the municipal charge to the general rates that are calculated so that then creates a movement from rating the dollar as opposed to the fixed charge and can I just have a follow-up with regards to these councils objective is to reduce it again in the next financial year to a 10% charge a 10% municipal charge any further change in the municipal charge will be subject to obviously councils direction when we get to that stage in the planning for the 1920-21 budget further questions councillors council retain oh I haven 't got any questions I was ready to move but I see those questions canceled a bit I 'd like to please move an alternative motion would you let me to I put before council today is that council one not dot the ax drop the draft budget 1920 as presented and dot to instruct officers to recast the draft budget to reflect the amount to be raised from rates and municipal charges in the 1920 budget remain at the 1819 level rather than be increased by 2.5% is currently proposed second a council buckley gives to further speak to your motion counts the Roberts thank you madam ma 'am when I stood for council in 2016 one of my key election commitments was to advocate for lower rates challenge challenge challenge in the status quo is often is not often an easy task which not with today being no exception however it 's not my job to take the easy route it 's my job to represent the community compounding rate increases have been a longtime concern of ratepayers with the recent section two to three hearing on the draft budget it was made very clear to me that the issue of rate rise is more important than ever with the ongoing effects of drought loss of industry struggling retailers unemployment rate 38 percent higher than the state average how is it acceptable that we increase the rates by two point five percent to me two point five percent appears to be merely an arbitrary figure handed down by the state government which is no real grounding with our community the total raised by rates a municipal charge in the proposed 1920 budget is fifty point three million dollars if council would have resolved not to apply the two point five percent rate increase and freezing the rates of the 1819 level it will come as an immediate saving of one point two five million dollars to the community this would require council to budget for only one point three percent less total income the community is doing it hard and we need to adjust our spending accordant accordingly instead of constantly increasing the rates by the maximum amount allowable amount every single year I heard you to support the alternative motion presenter before you Thank You councillor Buckley do you wish to speak to the motion yeah thank you madam me the when local government was first set up to properties like rubbish and roads but over this time it has changed no longer other rates just a service to property but a growing tax on things that should be funded through state and federal taxes since amalgamation rates have increased by way beyond people 's income growth II it became such an issue that the government had to step in to cap increases but even now we do not have to always tax to the maximum allowed year by year the increases keep compounding there are already gross inequities with farmer 's rates based on the valuation of potential property sales not income and to have enough paddocks the farm motorable titles are needed resulting in huge rate bills because of this communities are shrinking as smaller farms unviable families sell out or children do not carry on rates affect everybody impact on renters pensioners and businesses I believe we need a new way of looking at your operations with more careful spending and not and not expect an ever-increasing budget people criticize what they consider the show 's extravagant use of their money the huge cost projections and lawyers in particular too much been and litigation we must go back to basics genuinely engaged with our people listen to them and now they request a freeze on rates thank you madam me thanks count for buck we okay I mean further speakers speaker 4x cancel what thank you madam mayor oh yeah I also support this motion with this alternative motion my discussions are very undone the size of this organization and the budget that we have and we are looking to a little over 1% reduction in its total budget I 'm the the arguments been what services are we going to cut who 's going to miss out I disagree and I feel that that the labor 1 percent could be enabled by just looking at the efficiency of this organization and finding ways to do things better at less yeah it 's ok to frown at my discussion but I think it 's logical that we can achieve this or could achieve achieve what we are aiming for and that is to show some relief to the citizens of our Shire particularly as in job is to look after our communities and I feel that this is a way that we can help our communities thank you speakers counselor Ellis I 'm not ready to speak to demotion or against the motion at the moment madam me but I was hoping to be able to ask a few questions because we 've been taken a bit by surprise in terms of the rapidity of the introduction of the alternate motion I know it was coming but I wanted to ask a couple of questions of Miss Collins in relation to the effects of and impacts into the longer term of this particular motion I want I would like to get an understanding of a certain matters so as I can make a clearer decision than what I have made in relation to the matter I 'll allow question to miss Collins counselor sir thank you madam me mr. Collins taking on counselor Roberts point that we 've got a savings of 1.3 million dollars per year which on our gross budget and he 's only about 1.3 percent so it 's quite small but counsel so that over at the 10-year period of our long term budget this this savings will accrue accumulate to 12 million dollars or more am I reading that right Thank You counselor Ellis if there was no corresponding reduction in expenditure and it was only a reduction in the amount of rates to be raised yes and the compounding impact of that over ten years would be over twelve million dollars in terms of out of the cash another thing sadaqa reverting back to the budget of 2018 2019 the and taking into account the recommendation before us prior to the alternative motion being table there was a recommendation to provide farmers with a 17 and a half percent discount compared to the average land holder in their terms of their rate and in that in fact was approximately 50 percent cheaper than any other business operator in the in the country 55 percent sorry if the alternate motion is adopted we will revert back to the situation we had last year where the farmers will only effectively have a ten percent discount on the general rate that normal or do do they revert back to that higher discount that was initially put titled I 'm counselor Ellis and that would certainly be up to Council to make that decision in terms of if the budget had to be recast what the differential rates may be for commercial industrial and the farming properties noting that the 2019 20-year would be using the new valuations which as we know had a significantly greater increase in the farming sector than the other two sectors of council so absolutely up to Council would have to relook at all of that again and say well just to pick up on that so what you 're saying is that the farming communities properties increased in value at a higher rate than residential and commercial properties across the state and that was valued by the state the state attorney general Department the increase in valuations for the farming sector the percentage increase overall was a greater percentage than for residential and commercial industrial properties and those valuations there undertaken by the value in general Victoria its these questions but it 's important that we all that this alternative motion is does that impact upon the status of the Inc recommended increase in rates in fees and charges of two and a half percent does that those charges remain in place and once again that certainly would be up to Council if we were reviewing the budget again but at this stage the motion appears just to relate to to the rates and not to the proposed increase to fees and charges as per the revised budget thanks counselor Ellis council pups did you have a question just to follow up if counselor Roberts 's motion is not supported what opportunity has our community got to to voice their opinion with regards to the excessive farm increase right by the valuer general what opportunities is available to our community to resolve the costing of their their properties every year all ratepayers have an opportunity to lodge an objection to their evaluation if they believe that it is not correct and once the valuation rate notices are sent out there 's 60 days from the date of that notice for ratepayers to lodge those objections and to that objection come through to Council do they they object to Council for the valuation of their rate the valuation objections are dealt with by the valuer general but the initial inquiry in forms will be lodged through Council and then passed on through to the valley where general or his contractor who is undertaking the valuations are there any further speakers for or against their motion I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against motion is lost 5 we now deal with the motion the recommendation that is on the table counselor retain a move the motion thank you do I have a seconder thanks counselor Reeves do you wish to speak to your motion counselor retainer I think you made it may I 'd like to acknowledge the work that Luce Collins and the finance team have done with this there 's been a lot of iterations a lot of calculations a lot of assumptions challenged and so on the budgets been framed to ensure the organization is appropriately resourced to deliver the works services and initiatives set out in the revised of local media over the recent weeks about the proposed rate increases for the 2019 20 period in framing the budget we were very aware of the difficulties being experienced by the rural sector because of the current threat and the flow-on impacts that it 's having also having two other businesses in our region our budget today proposes that the differential rate for farm class of properties be reduced from ninety percent last year in the general rate to eighty two and a half percent this year in a general rate effectively a 17 2 percent discount the differential rate for the commercial industrial class of properties is proposed to decrease from 145 percent of the general rate to 143 percent of the general rate through this use of differential rates there will be there will be a rates of municipal charge increase of approximately 2.5 percent for each of the class property specifically there will be an increase from the 20 and 18 19 total rates and charges of 2.5 2 percent for residential properties 2.3 9% for commercial industrial and 2.5 percent for farming properties the average categories is 2.5 percent which is in line with Victorian Government 's rates cap Council believes rates must increase by this amount to ensure that we can continue to deliver services that our community have now and provide for a sustainable future this budget delivers a significant capital works program of forty five point six million dollars which has a strong focus on the renewal of East Gippsland considerable infrastructure these items include thirteen point eight million dollars for roads projects three point seven million dollars for bridges five point 1 million dollars to be spent on parks projects including a number of streetscapes 2.4 million is planned for connecting pathways from Eastwood 3 to Lucknow and stage one of the omiai mountain bike trails 1.4 million for is planned to be spent on Lakes Entrance seawall reconstruction Stage two three-quarters of a million dollars will be spent at Jimmy 's point Stage two three point six million dollars for waste projects and five point three million dollars for landfill rehabilitation projects to ensure council has some funds in reserve to respond to unexpected events including disasters and other contingencies 2019 20 year when the advance payment of seven point seven million dollars of the 2019 20 Victorian Grants Commission allocation has been taken into account is expected that there will be an underlying deficit of two point four five seven million and it 's always the underlying either surplus or deficit that 's the important measure of the operational financial performance as it negates the impact of one-off capital income for all other years of the strategic resource plan estimates an underlying surplus councils I believe the revised budget for 20 is responsible equitable in the best long-term interests of East Gippsland its community I encourage you to support its adoption on this basis thank you name is counselor retain a counselor raves do wish to spending well firstly I just like to acknowledge that counsel Roberts you stood on your convictions and you had a go and that should be acknowledged and we respect you for that however I 'm happy and delighted to support this budget and this this recommendation now this budget aspires to live a much of the good persistent and consistent leadership that has numbers of years now there 's no doubt those challengers counselors and community members who are here but these are shared by most rural shows across Victoria and Australia and we 've heard resoundingly that there is stress in aspects of the primary production sector just remember the major tax revenue rise our or razor in Australia is the federal government not local government the federal government and the major investment investor in regional Australia is local government and it 's in collaboration with the federal government that we do that investment that 's critical and we receive that money through federal assistance grants now we note that the right take from the farm sector is not inconsistent not insignificant but it represents about 5% of the total rate income and the overall income in our Shire however what the right strategy does is give concessions to the farm section sector who now benefit from about 50% reduction compared to the other commercial sectors in the Shire 55 is a councillor person we 've heard you and and this we believe is a responsible response using the levers that are strategy and this has flattened the rate burden across the shire just remember too that regular households of the shire carry the major rate burden that is the residential rate take has accepted really to support farmers by taking an increase that he spread across the Shire I 'm sure cancer Ellis you 'll mentioned the pensioners and the self-funded retirees who do it tough when issues interest rates are low like they are now but it 's also the residential workers who are the people of our Shire who struggle the workers in the mortgagees mortgagee years pay rates to their the workers the teachers the nurses the police officers business owners the push bike riders the pub workers the builders plumbers government workers fishers divers drivers and transport workers we all want a discount but we all want services as well that 's the challenge of the balance but we have to make decisions on there 's no doubt that we all want those rate cuts but it 's hard to hear what we are being asked to cut spending on if we do have a rate cut that and we 'll work responsibly in the next 12 months to work out where we can continue to save money without reducing services because we don 't want to close an or blossoming pool or reduce the services at Milo airfield for those care flights and ambulances or cut the planning department staff because they will affect also the approval time for applications we don 't want to cut the car parks crew do we all have the Rangers and then forget the dog collection or cut the tip times or the community events funding or the road repairs they 're all part of the services which are part of local government we can 't have rate cuts and cut and improve services and after four days in Canberra it 's clear and apparent that investment is the key to let our critical infrastructure both physical and human lag is the travesty for the future this budget is a budget that balances the challenges of revenue-raising service provision infrastructure renewal and capital construction among many other many others and I 'm happy now I 'm actually delighted supported and race are there any speakers against councillor Buckley thank you mad at me we local government a little more than a tax collection agency on behalf of the state government this is our only opportunity to suppress our opinion in relation to the greater powers and there 's no way this can be turned around now I wouldn 't think but I want to remind you of that that we should attempt to retain some autonomy thank you madam me thanks counselor Buckley speakers full count for Pope 's yes I 'm happy to or pleased to be supporting the the current motion that 's been put to the table I have to say in no disrespect to our community we have worked diligently on this since November last year and we 've heard the cries of the community in regards to the hardships that they 're going through we thank you all for your submissions and for coming to the table and talking to us about what your requirements are and I have to say whilst we 're unable to entertain the vast part of it at this stage the burden the tax burden or the rape burden in regards to dispersing the percentage and I think this council has been successful we 've changed it in response since the few days we 've changed the original draft budget to address what we have now and I think it 's a responsive budget collectively from the information that the community has given to the councillors and the council group as a whole and I 'd like that to be noted specifically because it 's not that we can you know just because you decide this year you want a 50% rape freeze and you want you want to rape freeze and you want a 50% reduction you know how does counsel ever respond or bounce back from that it 's actually not acceptable to be looking at that and it 's also irresponsible for us to be entertaining that but we have given you what we feel is reasonable and it 's actually something that the state government has said to us when we attended the the rural council summit in March April that the the labor state government system is set up within the next 12 months and that came from Graham eminence and himself so with that in mind we will take what you 've delivered to us respectfully and we will use it as a submission towards their their review and as a council group we we will do the utmost to represent you at that level so with that in mind I want to thank you all and I think this is a responsible budget in response to our current economic situation thank you thanks counselor pouts because for counselor Ellis thank you madam mayor this has undoubtedly been the most difficult of all budgets of experience to date in my time as a councilor the word autonomy was referred to used by councillor Buckley and I appreciate him for for for reminding me of the importance of local government in this as a standalone level of government this budget has been affected negatively by impacts from outside our level of government we 've seen interference from lobby groups we 've seen interference from perhaps a higher levels of government that is the distraught that need to impose in continual increases in rate cap rates comes from the higher sectors of government it was a reminder I was reminded again whilst that the yoga Conference of the fact that when once upon a time low government was funded by 1% of the gross national product of our country that figure now 's down to about 0.55 percent which means that we as a community have to look after ourselves and at times it 's not palatable to have to face this reality some of the arguments had come through have led to what I was wrestled with difficulty in that was a principle of entitlement and that was a part of the argument that made it difficult for me to make a decision in this matter I was cotton or not the fact that when I had we received as a council a petition of 500 signatures that is our message to council to be better money managers and I 've taken that on board we have workshop this budget for the last six months and it 's only in the last month or so lobbying come on to us Oh an VD I don 't envy the mayor and the CEO for some of the approaches that they have received in this process I can give you an undertaking that as a councillor I will continue to work to represent members of the community out in our wider area I do particularly contain concerned about the inability councils seems to have of protecting our pensioners and people on fixed incomes I think councillor resource um many of these words in relation to the makeup of our community because they need representation we can 't singularly focus on one group I have vast empathy for the farming community and I don 't wish to enter into that discussion on entitlement but I just believe that we all should look for the best for all of our community and that includes farmers pensioners and tradesmen and other people that make up our community in concluding I commend the budget in the sense that it 's practical one of the issues that makes me support this is that if we were to support the failed amended demotion a half thousand twelve and a half million dollars which we would have to find that 's a responsibility for some other council to wrestle with and I would not want to impose that difficulty on a future council that would have to go cap in hand to perhaps an unsympathetic state government and ask for a 15% rate rights to meet the demands of any any particular issue that comes forward we have we have a surplus for good reason and it 's been well explained by mr. Collins the surpluses meet the uniqueness of our particular Shire and that is that if we are to face particular natural disasters whether it be five blood or other horror we will a will be able as an organization to fund actions to meet that from those cash reserves they are there for a purpose counselors this is a responsible budget it 's subject to review by us as managers over the next 12 months and I suggest that next year we will not need to have such a difficult decision-making process thank you thanks counselor Ellis speakers against counselor what who have spoken for this budget they 've discussed at length the position that our council is in and our communities in and talking about how everyone 's doing it tough and yet here we are sitting around and about to make it tougher by asking for more money that is why I 've supported councilor Roberts motion defeated motion thank you any further speakers counselor retain idea we should have a right of reply thank you madam mayor look just quickly within the framework that our organization operates in at this time I believe this is a responsible nickel budget I 'd like to thank the community that 's coming out today I 'd like to also thank them for the hearing submissions there 's a lot of documentation they 've poured over the budgets and the council plan I would like to encourage other people within our community to read the budget document in conjunction with the council plan read these two strategic documents to give the reader an idea and understanding of the multitude of works and services and projects that council delivers and what is planned say if this motion is supported that I 'd like to foreshadow a motion around requesting the chief executive officer and the operations setting them an objective to achieving an ongoing net saving of one-half million dollars for the 2920 financial year and report back to Council by the 30th of September with the recommendation on how this outcome can be achieved but as I say that 's a foreshadowed emotional thanks council ratinho I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against motion is carried 5 3 okay councillor Tino do you wish to speak to your foreshadowed motion thank you madam mayor I 'd like to request the council 's chief executive officer review the organization 's operations with the objective of achieving an ongoing net saving of one and a half million dollars for the 2019 20 financial year and the two reports back to Council by the 30th of September 2019 with a recommendation on how this outcome can be achieved we 'll just get the motion up on the screen to review 21 madam mayor point of order shouldn 't whispering and carrying on shouldn 't we declare it we 're just waiting for the motion to be put up on the screen so that everyone can read it the foreshadowed motion we 're just waiting to be put up on to the screen so that everyone can see what was said like councillor Tino is that the emotion that you craved thank you madam a that yes it does reflect more intent on be happy to discuss it further if I get a second thanks counselor Pelt counsel retainer do you wish to speak further yeah madam mayor I 'd like to firstly come in the CEO in his first six months with the our organization and he 's made some significant organizational restructure changes and I believe that this challenge just sits with how we 're setting up the organization to better serve our community thank you thanks council retainer councillor pelt yes to to concur with my colleagues you can celerity know I believe that our CEO is putting in some great framework he 's listening to us in hand with the community and this this motion our community today whilst we were unable to address it in the the previous motion this actually is a a move forward on how we can address their issues in the next financial year so I believe this is a active response to the community 's request and I 've believed that our CEO who 's doing a great job we believe he 's actually up to it and he 'll be able to get these figures more in Tanjung forests thank you thanks council coats are there further speakers for Thank You councillor Buckley well not necessarily it 's a question for council ratinho why are we doing this isn 't the CEO already doing all this why do we have to put an exact figure on it it 's already done we 're just wasting counsels time here with extra stuff that 's quite obviously being done if you ask me because I to see I was well worth his salt he 's done a great job since he 's been here and I can 't see the need for this thank you that doesn 't mean to wanted to speak against the motion I see I feel this is a bit of show pony and I 'm sorry Joe to say that but if we need to do this and instruct the CEO to do something that we have workshop for then what was the point of rejecting councillor Roberts as 1.3 savings why why couldn 't we not do this as a matter of course this is the this is the twist when when we do these sort of rushed sort of motions we would be looking as a council to make those savings regardless and I pick up on what councillor Buckley has said that is I would expect the CEO and he 's executive tend to be working to amend it to a to provide counsel with the best management financial management possible for this council council as I said to my words earlier have been listening to the community and I 'm well aware of the need to fight manage financially well into the future this this really does not achieve anything it 's an expectation that I would expect everyone of us 't support this thank you any further speakers capsule arrays look I 'm happy to speak to it I think that there are some sage words that have been said and counselor Ellis in as much as anybody has said a positive contribution whoever I don 't mind targets I don 't mind setting targets so they 're really specific they 're clear you know that they and they 're timely as well I think this is not a bad thing to do it gives us in the next budget period the opportunity to look for those savings and that could mean that this time next year when we 're setting this budget we can have these vigorous discussions about rate levels because we 're looking at perhaps an environment where there have been some identified potential savings so I think it 's not a bad idea to do this you know I agree I 'm not a person to have these spontaneous motions as such but I think this one does set a specific target for the CEO and for us it holds us accountable so I 'm happy CEO through you madam mayor councillors thank you for the compliments I certainly can 't take all those I work with great staff and and they should be recognized as part of that as well I would ask that I 'm certainly not against anything like this happy to meet councils and community expectations around those sort of financial management targets what I would ask is perhaps a little bit more time and for two reasons one is because of the way our our meeting cycle works actually September meeting would mean that I 've got a month six weeks give or take to actually get that work done and to do it well I 'm not sure that 's significant enough time when we 've also got a whole range of other things that are happening across the organisation and that 's the second item is that I 'm in the process of recruiting a new executive team as some people would know and this is right sort of in there it would be essentially very early days well and I 'm just wondering if we want to get couple of extra months or to the end of the year may actually provide a better better outcome that we could feed then into next year 's budget process councillor why thank you madam mayor this is to you mr. CEO I would have been thinking that although this is a commendable motion but would you have not been working towards this outcome anyway without being held to a to a motion at this meeting at this time that you would have working towards the savings and I think as you rightly say with looking to get a new executive team they would form an integral part of of how you go about getting these savings through you madam chair this this motion that is proposed certainly sets this very specific target to meet I have a clear goal and responsibilities around making sure that we are financially sustainable and often people talk about efficiencies but you also need to make sure that you remain effective so I would certainly be working towards financial sustainability and making sure we find savings wherever possible and I think it is worth noting debate and it 's a very passionate debate the materials budgets for council programs don 't go up from year to year unless they are required to under contracts or there is an external influence on it so like utility charges they have to go up but on the whole our program dollars in terms of the delivery they stay at zero so we have effectively over time been having a zero increase so effectively you could argue a net decrease in program dollars over time so you know it is my responsibility and and staffs responsibility to manage our budgets well and find savings wherever can and we do that so yes I would is the short answer on the other hand this sets a very clear target and very clear timeframe thanks mr. CEO council retainer did you have a question a question to this second oh she 's happy I 'd like to change the date to 30th of December or December 2019 December thanks okay are there any further speakers no do you ever do you wish to have a right of reply counsel retainer thank by cancer Alice 's comments that I may have done this is some sort of special acknowledgement us I just can 't believe those comments at all really tell you the truth counselor Ellis given that I only became aware of this council Robert 's amendment some several hours ago to suggest that I 'm I 've been grandstanding is almost laughable what gets measured gets done on I 'm happy accept all the comments today I see I may be doing this stuff and I agree that he probably is but I 've seen so many times where it 's not measure that doesn 't get done so to have an amount and a time frame there actually does it in a way that 's more of a strategic approach rather than an ad hoc approach finding out today about this other amendment and it also gives us opportunity to talk to our community is if we find there might be some services that we want to challenge it gives us time to talk to our community thank you madam e thanks counselor Tino I 'll put the motion yeah thank you motion motion carried six to item five point one point three draft local law number one procedures for council meetings approval for public consultation mr. Stephen Columbus thank you madam mayor and councillors this report obviously seeks Council 's approval to commence the statutory processes required to set in place draft revised local law number one procedures for council meetings specifically it 's asking you to sorry I thought it was this report seeks Council 's approval to commence the statutory processes required to sit in place draft revised local law number one specifically it is asking Council to put in place a section 2 2 3 procedure of public consultation and to also give public notice of its intention to make thanks mr. Columbus are there any questions from councillors council this is the draft local law any questions councillors if not I 'll put the motion to you I 'm Aneta member sorry thanks counselor retainer thanks Council what sorry raving ahead speakers councillor Roberts while I generally agree with the amendments to local law there is one area that um that 's something that the rest and that 's the final point on page 25 that confirms that this chair manages all aspects of the request to speak on a general on an agenda item and the mainly the point being that the speakers will be allowed between 3 and 5 minutes I raised this one will workshopping this and I feel that maybe that 's a little bit restrictive and prevents us from being able to have a dynamic meeting if the chair wishes to extend that are greater than five minutes so that 's my only concern about this and I think during the section two to three process if the community tends to agree with that fact that they should form a submission and have it be heard of the two to three so I don 't think I 'll be able to support the recommendation based on those but it 's more of a moral no sorry poor choice of words it 's more of a a bad feeling objection not so much to the to the motion itself but to that specific item so thank you because for or son he 's come into moral because if he got a bad feeling that is a moral thing so Thank You councillor Robards councillor I 'm happy to speak in favor of the motion this has been workshop by the councillors for many many weeks now and let 's get it out there to the community and get that feedback in terms of the speaking time it begs the question to me you know that old saying about sorry for writing a long letter if I had more time I would have written a short one thanks counts the raise and I think we 'll find our neighbors actually have capped at three minutes speaking times Wellington Volvo and the tribe so I think we were actually yeah any for the speaker 's council Pelt in regards to the bottom line is when someone 's coming to the table they 've already written in a letter and we 've read their letters so when they actually come to the table we 're only expecting them to drive home there three or four main drill points because we 've heard it 're talking about so the the time that they need is probably no longer than three minutes because if you grant ten five minutes each we 've been sitting here for 15 minutes and we still come to the same agreement at the end of the day so the bottom line is quite often the points are heard and heard and re heard again and we heard them the first time as to why I 'm quite comfortable with the three minutes three to five minutes any further speakers put the motion to all those in favour those against motions carried six I don 't fire point one point for home care funding agreements 2019 2020 council retainer and myself have a conflict of interest due to being board members of Romeo District Health old now asked council white to resume the chair thank you madam mayor okay we will receive our one submission from mr. Nelson thank you this report is seeking councils consideration of a recommendation to renew funding agreements that we have with poor service providers that provide the direct or the contribute to the provision of had in is Gippsland with providers it 's something that 's been really successful because these are these organizations are based in their communities working with the people that they 're delivering services to or a whole range of different support services so it is locally delivered and we 've had this arrangement in place for quite some time but as you 'll see from this report there are quite significant changes and reforms happening in the health and stability sector and so this report is really saying based on our engagement with the government so the state and Commonwealth Government and the nav and other councils we 're really saying at this point in time because the rollout of the NDIS when National Disability Insurance Scheme and changes to the funding that it 's important that council maintains a holding pattern at this time until we understand more fully how our community will transition and right now that 's not clear so the recommendation is to extend or enter into new agreements which is effectively a renewal of previous arrangements with AMI ojas district health or bas Regional Health Community Health for a 12-month period during that period and in the lead up to the end of that 12 month period officers will again evaluate the impact of the changes in the reforms but we have created an opportunity for a further extension if we have any questions absolutely go ahead sorry if I may take your limelight cancel the ribs I 'm I just wanted to know in your Avenue it 's Nelson are there further opportunities to the council to be able to get grant funding to feed into this pool keeping the fact that I 'm reading here 40% of our population will be over is over 60 and they 're quite huge statistics when you look at it and this area is becoming a real an avenue for aged care and it 's becoming a niche sector and we 're getting we 're really renowned for our compassionate services up here and how we actually look after our aged people if their quality of life is great and you know and they 're really enjoying the region and the community so I 'm hoping there into that we can help aid this particular sector of our community you 're right that the proportion of older people who 'll be eligible for this funding will increase over time at the moment the way this works local government in Victoria makes a contribution to from its own resources the delivery of those services and councils all over the state are reviewing their contribution in the context of these reforms so at the moment what council does is provide funding equal to 25% of the grants that these organizations directly receive from the Victorian Government so there isn 't the reason to further grant funding that council can attract to support this so this is resources that council is putting into this program for the reasons that you 're just outlined in terms of how important it is to maintain people 's health and well-being and and keeping people in their places particularly in small communities where that 's where someone makes all of their lives so at the moment there isn 't there isn 't an opportunity to find additional funds but what what we 're recommending through the NDIS and other streams of funding how that becomes allocated to people in this community and then what councils role is into the future so in the next 12 months we 'll do that in regards to these I 'm finding myself not that where my father is eligible for this kind of service but I 'm finding he 's still in need of some kind of service but the bottom line for this is the response that is available to people 's demise their abilities and I think it 's something that 's really important to position that that our reaction time or our reactions sources of this is responsive to their ailing issues I think that 's probably one on only get to a challenge I guess in terms of how the the providers the resources they have to distribute and many of these services are universally accessible services so people are eligible when they reach a particular age or circumstance and what in fact the service providers are telling us is that with the transition to the NDIS there are people that they have not as eligible for funding so there there will be changes in the way that people access different levels of support and that 's really what I 'm saying in terms of understanding how our community transitions from the current arrangements to new ones and to what extent council needs to continue to be a supporter of these services Victoria is unusual across Australia because in Victoria and local government has traditionally had a role in by providing a contribution to these services where it doesn 't happen in most states so I think that councils in Victoria in light of the kind of discussions that councils been having today about budget you know realistically most councils are looking at a review of the way that they engaged it 's important to every council that their aging community the question is does council continue to have a role as these funding arrangements and the system do we have any more questions thank you miss Nelson do we have somebody to what mark council arose and second to councilor pelts do you like just thanks mr. deputy mayor this is a very also the transition to NDIS I do note and ask again the CEO that keep us abreast of the changes even though there 's a note in here for you to exercise an option but I 'm sure you will keep us informed of that main reason being councillors is that our communities is unique we are so dispersed and as you can see we distribute these these funds to those four organizations to deliver these services across the four corners of our Shire and what we 're seeing and what I 'm concerned about with NDIS is that change from what we have known as and valued as place based services might might change and those those recipients those needy members of our community might be serviced by people from afar and who they don 't know and so on and that 's one that 's one of my concerns while there 's there 's a potential great advantage through the NDIS and the changes that are potential here but there 's also something that we need to keep on watching briefed on as counselors if we 're concerned of the demographic the far-flung nature of our community members constituents hood tucked away in corners up valleys around the back of our little Hamlet 's and are used to those place based services we don 't want to diminish that level of service that we we provide you like to speak to the moon yes I would like to speak to it and I just like to highlight with regards to our budget that we 've just moved that the council 's contribution in our notes and I 'm reading from them for the 1819 financial year are yet to be finalized but the amount exceeds approximately six hundred and ninety thousand dollars across the for service providers which I reckon is fantastic and here we are looking at you know hidden ways that we 're cost-cutting but I really hope this is an area that we won 't because cutting in and I really think that I 'm that you know I look at it and I just sort of think you get to this ability stage in life and you know you sort of think that you of hope that that 's an area that we definitely do not look at in the way of cutting or from our CEO point of view anyway I just wanted to race that we have any more speakers all right well at this stage he 'll put this to the poet all those for carried 6-0 may call them ear back in please 5.2.1 planning permit application to eight 20 18 p application for two lot subdivision to excise and existing drawing at 1090 Deptford Road Clifton Creek and I have a request to speak from Allen Sheridan madam mayor did observe him leave that quite some time ago if not I 'll ask miss Nicole Reynolds to come forward and speak to the item please good afternoon counselors this item you may recall was a deferred item that was presented for some consideration at the meeting of the 5th of June where in the matter was deferred just by summation this is an application which proposes a to lot subdivision to excise an existing dwelling at a farming property at 1090 Deptford Road the land is approximately 78 hectares infrastructure the land is zoned farming zone which is similar to the land in the surrounding area on balance officers have assessed the application and we consider it to be deemed that is it are unable to meet the provisions of the purposes of the farming zone the overall aim of the farming zone is in fact to maintain and improve agricultural production of land the recommendation before you seeks to issue a notice of decision just to refuse to issue a planning permit based on six grounds our officers assessment is as follows the proposed subdivision results in an unacceptable fragmentation of rural land the proposed subdivision results in a rural living outcome within the farming zone the subdivision creates a small lot less than the scheduled 40 hectares in the farming zone the proposed subdivision results in as of right use for the purposes of use of the balanced lot for the purposes of a dwelling in an area nominated for farming in addition the as of right use is established within an area that 's encumbered by the bushfire management overlay provisions the smaller Lodge is created subdivision results in an additional dwelling within the rural landscape the application provides no compelling reasons for the additional dwelling when assessing applications within the farming zone it 's important to ensure that rural living outcomes are not the outcomes farm dwellings are genuinely required to support agriculture enterprises are not a form of rural residential development thank you thanks miss Reynolds are there questions counselors no further questions I have a recommendation before us councillor Roberts I 'd like to move the alternate motion it 's been circulated madam mayor thanks council roberts do we have a seconder for the alternative motion council what thanks council roberts do you wish to speak thank you madam mayor I don 't have anything prepared so I 'll try and keep it succinct but it seems to me that the as as was mentioned by the office of the air the outcome of the farming zone is to be able to retain the use for agricultural purposes however the applicant wishes to subdivide because he 's not able to currently use the land as it currently stands I believe in lack of the only real step forward that will allow somebody to be able to take up part ownership take up ownership of the second lot and actually try and gain some sort of valuable use out of it so I urge councillors to support the alternative motion thank you thanks council robux council a white you wish to speak to the motion I was looking at part three of this I would expect that this is just a standard format to referring to to gas services etc which obviously we 've had miss Reynolds do wish to clarify you 're referring to a condition number three is that correct yep we just flicked the page over thank you um Thank You counselor Wyatt for your question yes this is a standard condition that relates to two lot subdivisions that goes to requirements to enter into agreements with the utility installations so with respect to your question it is a standard condition you just just say anything further counsel what no any further speakers question counsel Roberts I 've got a question I noticed what we 've done in the past when three also required the provisioning of optic fiber services which we found to be quite entertaining I noticed that 's not in point three of this document is there something changed in there the requirements Thank You counselor for your question yes that relates to subdivisions of properties where they 've got access to telecommunication and fathers and not into farming area so we don 't you don 't see those standard conditions in the farming zone areas yeah thanks speakers against speakers for council retain oh thanks madam mayor we 've got supposes it 's just a bit of my own personal view on a few things but I have seen some fantastic farmland around this region cut up in subdivided and I 've seen other land that 's marginal where they couldn 't subdivide it would better suited sub subdivision so what I 'm trying to say is there 's a lot of inconsistencies around this and in the absence of the rural land use strategy I 'm happy to support this alternate recommendation motion thank you thanks counselor Tino are there any further speakers count slow Roberts 'll put the motion to you all those in favor opposed against motion carried 7 1 item 5.2 point 2 adoption of the draft Eagle Point structure plan we have some requests to speak to this agenda item first off is mr. Andrea Bassett did you wish to come to the microphone and just let you know you have five minutes to speak madam chair councillors minds very brief I 'll just write to the point with great concerns and regards to the pros review or the removal of the restrictive covenant and we continue object to any variation or modification of the restrictive covenant removing the covenant completely we believe will suffer detrimental effects the residents on the following grounds the restrictive covenant which is a registered covenant under property law was put in place for the sole reason of protecting the character of Matheson 's row precinct which has been maintained for over 30 years and should be preserved the Covenant has served the president well until recent events such as section 128 on the 28th of December 2017 resulting in a loss of privacy and overlooking on the dominance of multiple dwellings when viewed from original law Donis properties loss of spaciousness beauty and privacy we don 't have faith that the removal will be in our interests given the council 's actions in the past I section 120 out of 2017 and a proven not to Anna proven not to act in interest of original landowners we 're by varying the covenant to reward those who are in breach of the original restrictive covenant Thank You mr. Bassett Oni out ask mr. Graham Barnett to come speak thank you madam mayor councillors good afternoon my name is Graham Barnett I live at 140 Forge Creek Road near the Paintsville roundabout Road and I 'd like to speak on the report by miss Reynolds particularly about the in relation to these sand water wastewater facility located some 900 meters from my property or house actually these these matters are referred to in pages 58 and 59 of the report only in the last few days have I been advised of apostle need to provide protection for their facility they skip stone waters in the form of buffers process however I submit that if he skips and water adopted effective maintenance procedures for optimum plant reliability and performance there will be no need to provide such protection the word protection seems a strange expression to me anyway on the contrary it must be surely in the interests the best interests of east clips and Shire and ratepayers to have some form of reassurance from escapes and water that their plant will not in any way be a safety risk to residents rather than to obstruct developer development on my property by the use of buffers in the East Gipson used only a couple of weeks ago I read that it was called bumper engineering projects I read that escapes and water customers stand to benefit from the latest six point three million dollar round of engineering projects designed to safeguard and enhance water services but there 's absolutely no mention in that article of protecting their forged Creek Road wastewater treatment plant and I wonder why that is the case further a 2011 US EPA report on principles of design and operations of wastewater treatment pond systems for 2.5 to States for several good reasons that they 're for designing extensive buffer zones for aerosol containment is not recommended so I must contest sections of the Eagle Point plan which refer to the specific control of new residential dwellings around Painesville wastewater treatment plant to the to reduce the risk of offensive odors however misconceived or inconsequential these risks or perceptions might be i generally support the draft plan in particular the removal of the restrictive covenant but must request these last-minute updated requirements or inclusions for the treatment plan to be removed please before it is adopted by council thank you thank you mr. Barnett sure council pouts more ownership should be taken on the Water Authority to mask the odors from that the ponds that they 're actually got there and I don 't think that 's an unreasonable thing how do we go about addressing that in regards to this eagle point plan thank you Thank You Council of helps for your question essentially if I may answer it in this way the structure plan is is part of the purpose of the structure plan Point and one of the directions need to is to recognize and protect the existing infrastructure for East Gippsland water in the form of the wastewater treatment plant this is not something that is specific to us locally it is a state provision in relation to protection of these assets with respect to infrastructure your second part of the question related to the process there is potentially a second process with respective preparation of planning scheme amendment documentation to be initiated by East Gippsland water in in serving to recognize and protect this infrastructure so the Eagle Point structure plan provides that high-level recognition that the wastewater treatment plant is there it also announces that we will work collaboratively in the future with these kits and water to ensure that the right planning controls are in place furthermore the Eagle Point structure plan for shadows that the process the appropriate process is another planning scheme amendment process wherein issues in relation to ongoing operational requirements and issues relating to schedules and controls in relation to residential are able to be addressed and addressed in a level of detail that we so then going forward you would expect that mr. Barnett 's concerns would be addressed if the plan is adopted that he will still be considerations we looked at in conjunction with these capes I 'm water needs to keep playing oh man Thank You councillor white yes the property rights are protected through the requirement that a planning scheme amendment be prepared to implement any new requirements in relation to the protection of this facility and the impact it has on land and dwellings around there will be in the in the when if East Gippsland water choose to be a proponent and advance of planning scheme amendment the process will enable public notification and discussion with landowners directly affected by foreshadowed controls thank you and now mr. sandy mix green McSweeney to come and speak thank you all for letting me speak today we have a property that is located at 34 G Creek Road I 've made a number of I 've made a detailed submission to the Planning Department with regards to their plans to do a number of changes to the way our land is draft proposal they want to rezone how property to low density residential from general residential our property adjoins other general residential properties and as such we would like for it to remain as general residential our property is basically our superannuation fund for us to have this change of zoning it will restrict our ability to fund our retirement basically it will it will change who and how we can market the property if we choose to redevelop it the constraints that the planning system has in place will make sure that we don 't make an undesirable development from the land that we currently have we have constraints of topography the bushfire Management overlay and we don 't think that it 's necessary to rezone our land there is also changes that in the draft proposal to there that are identified as giving land over to public conservation for open space purposes we not in support of this the land that we have currently is wholly maintained by us we purchased the land from the show in 1996 when that was purchased the land was basically overrun with Blackberry we have very manicured type environment and us giving the land back to the Shire we can 't see how it 's going to get managed any better than it was back in 1996 we also have a significant issue with stormwater that is directed onto our property that from other adjoining developments which we 've approached the planning department to try and address on a number of occasions dating back to 2013 and we have had no resolution so I would like to try and suggest that the adoption of this draft plan be postponed from this meeting we were advised less than a week ago that this draft plan was coming to today 's meeting and we have not had any time to prepare anything to try and hold this at all or defer it we may the submission that we made back into that in November 2019 so in 2018 we have not had any response back from the planning department since November 2018 up until a week ago with regards to our submission I don 't know how it can be passed when there is no at the minimum that this be deferred counselor pouts if I may miss rennolds just mean regards to this McSweeney 's statement that she hasn 't had any response back from a letter since 2018 in regards to her concerns has there been review or return of Correspondence in regards to what she 's talking about Thank You councillor palps for your question we have been in an ongoing conversation with the landowner at 34 Forge Creek Road there have been meetings following the submissions throughout the process and 3430 Forge there have been meetings in relation to the draft structure plan on an ongoing basis there has been correspondence over the period of the strategic planning process counselor Ellis just to clarify there so it 's McSweeney ryan saying that she and the other two presenters have only had one weeks notice is that correct letters were forwarded a week ago by email confirming that the confirming that over the coming weeks that this matter would be listed with counsel so a week ago yes final questions I 'm thinking that I might make a suggestion to Council that meet with their staff to resolve the issues and potentially resolve the issue stood there for enhance their project but the questions that are matters that have been put forward today today 's meeting before I make that move have they been presented to the council planners previously and discussed with each of the three presenters and some sort of resolution sort we have had multiple conversations with the presenters over the period of time the presenters today yes there have been multiple over the life of this project yes so has any resolution been able to be achieved obviously with the Matis know that mrs. McSweeney sings he 's sitting there has forever eyes my apologies Alice could you just repeat that question I 'm referred to mrs. McSweeney just in the sense that she 's sitting at the table but would the issues that she 's raised so that any has there been any attempt or any resolution achieved in relation to the medicine that she 's put forward to council today perhaps if I may present the report I may be able to answer that question in on-site and in our council offices with with submitter in relation specifically to land at 34 G Creek Road okay well I 'm not know I might ask that you present the report miss Reynolds and then that way we can direct any further questions following the information that we receive thanks mr. Sweeney miss Reynolds madam if I may just you drive I 'll just foreshadow that I may make a move emotion that this matter like after the report may be adjourned to a future meeting thanks miss Reynolds thank you very much for the opportunity today the purpose of our council report is to present to you for adoption of the draft eagle point of structure plan just to recap what is a precinct structure plan it 's a high-level master plan that we do for the whole of the township of Eagle Point this is a process that has been a foot since 2012 and we reenergized the project in 2016 the approach that we have taken in developing a precinct master plan is to establish a vision and prepare a series of technical reports create high-level approach to how we prepare these plans the draft structure plan was released for comment in September 2018 following a options paper that was actually released in June 2017 both these processes resulted in a series of further on site and a series of landowner meetings in addition to the publication of a what we heard paper informing every landowner in Eagle Point of our progress and of the key strategic directions which we were following the communica consultation period undertaken was a an eight week period and we received comments and feedback from a series of agencies and stakeholders including landowners as a result our final draft has been modified to make some additional references in respect to natural hazards bushfire flooding and the issues raised in relation to the east gippsland water treatment facility the structure plan proposes a vision statement which we 've tested with the community in relation to setting a goal for what is the vision for Eagle Point the structure plan will identify a settlement boundary and it will identify strategic sites where we will need to do further work with landowners specifically have been identified as performing strategic importance to Eagle Point and we will require more detailed discussion as we move forward in relation to the specific controls relating to these sites also in relation to the structure plan it enunciates and describes some key residential neighborhoods which provide us with guidance on how we guide change over time the structure plan will support the growth of the Eagle Point primary school on the current site and includes the identical dental occation of land for future growth of the school on that side the structure plan will recognize and reinforces the importance of the four sure as a key community precinct if I may just briefly take to the key planning matters that have a reason through this journey the first one is the bushfire planning as a result of key VC amendments at state level we took the action of commissioning a peer review an independent peer review of the draft structure by a bushfire planning consultant this report and peer review review confirms that we are in a sound have a sound strategic position and that future development will have added new sections to the structure plan in real in response to the new controls at state level in relation to bushfire the Eagle Point structure plans response to a bushfire is is to is to confirm that any new development areas will require to have a Belle level of low and this negates our need this negates this addresses our response to the state level changes with bushfire the plan has been updated to add a new section in relation to flooding and resilience by adding a section on natural hazard of flooding with respect to the Matheson 's road or the restrictive covenant area the structure plan has been identified over a long period of time our being a key strategic document to provide us with direction in relation specifically to this neighborhood council has been and will continue to receive legal advice in relation to this matter of restrictive covenant I refer to the speaker who took us to planning scheme amendment c128 wherein the panel report confirmed that we were in fact working towards finalizing the preparation of the Iger point structure firm in order impact of the restrictive covenants the current zoning provisions and our future directions for this precinct in this way a future planning scheme amendment documentation will need to be to be drafted and in doing so we will need to address specifically how the planning scheme responds to the issue of the restrictive covenant in in reviewing the covenant structure plan proposes to retain the existing community hall at the existing location I 'll note that recommendation also makes reference to a place naming request as part of the community consultation it was raised that an element of part of Eagle Point that 's known at a locality known as Eagle Point that residents had concerns that they would like to for us to address the correct place now and that 's a separate process and I will too and I take you to the recommendation at hand essentially our recommendation today is to adopt the structure plan our recommendation is to allow us to continue discussions with CFA in making sure that our bushfire response is appropriate our recommendation seeks us permission to commence the preparation of the planning landowners the recommendation notes ongoing budgetary planning processes and it also seeks to commence the statutory process associated in relation to place names and localities which is a separate process not undertaken by the planning 's planning act thank you thanks miss Reynolds questions councillors count four and not holding back talking to the people that are needing some further consultation thank you for your question counselor pelts there is no urgency that it that it has to be done today there are no statutory requirements for it to be considered I do say though that we have undertaken extensive community consultation and that our discussions with landowners will continue upon the adoption of our recommendation specifically with risk with response to the specific landowner these areas of land are identified in the plantings in the in the structure plan as requiring further and ongoing discussions which will need to take place as part of the preparation of the planning scheme amendment documentation which will implement the key strategic directions what the Eagle what the adoption of the structure plan does is establishes the high level strategic directions for Eagle landowners do you have a question counselor Ellis no I 've just yeah councillor Roberts do you have a question thank you madam mayor miss Reynolds so you 're saying the affected landowners landowners still have an avenue of negotiating the outcome of their property rezoning is that correct thank you Roberts yes the structured plan sets the strategic direction at high level the specifics in relation to the specific details relating to rezoning requests the requirements that we were proposed to put in the planning scheme in the East Gippsland planning scheme are still open to a pro a formal planning scheme amendment process yes there is into the future further an ongoing opportunity for specific details to specific land to be addressed just a follow-up question thank you for that ultimately any any outcome around rezoning would need to be consistent and it wouldn 't be done on a on a title by title basis it would have to be a consistent blocks of land would be zoned accordingly Thank You councillor Roberts the approach that the structure plan is proposing is a precinct approach yes there are precincts but this is the first step to establish those neighborhood character statements about the very values that make up the land upon which we will then commence the structuring of the actual planning scheme amendment documentation and the planning control changes as applying to the individual paper parcels the point being that it 's a precinct approach thanks miss rennolds councillor white thanks madam mayor the question I have is as number 30 is beside residential allotments what is the current zoning of number 30 at this stage number 34 G Creek Road is currently zoned general residential zone it has recently also been partially contained within the bushfire Management overlay this property adjoins crown land it adjoins and contains tires Creek waterway which is vegetated the land is partially encumbered by the bushfire management overlay and we have commissioned as part of our peer review with our bushfire management consultant was to review the status of this land having regard for the incorporation into the bush fire management overlay I advance that is an a cautionary and an appropriate response that the bushfire planning be taken into consideration so I reiterate that I have advanced that the bushfire management consultant is of the opinion that we need to be able to meet the Bell low risk this property is included in the bush fire management overlay we all need to work through the details in relation to the development having regard for that over riding bushfire Management thanks counselor Ellis made a mere I 'd like to move that this matter be deferred until the next ordinary meeting of Council to be held after the August in August and the rationale for this tease that I 've read the recommendations on this where and I see that they 're all logical and they 're all ongoing and they can address many of the issues potentially or accommodate the issues raised by the speaker 's here today so let 's get it right for these three members of the community by giving them the early opportunity to have one more meeting with the council planners to get a clearer understanding on their positions with with Council I I don 't see the deferment of the matter up holding up the concerns of the speakers and finally it will get it hip things right and hopefully we 'll be able to resolve this matter so that when it is brought back in or August it 's just a matter of virtually passing the matter through if if things are able to be resolved so I look to council for support on this promotion thank you thanks councillors do we have a seconder councillor roberts thank you you wish to speak no okay Oh put the any other further speakers war against night I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against oppression carried 5-3 thanks miss Reynolds item six urgent and other business yep just before we move in I just like to acknowledge that this is Miss Kate Nelson 's last council meeting before her departure date in July so I 'd like to take this moment to acknowledge your many years of service to the council and the East Gippsland region and appreciate all they have done and best wishes for your future endeavors thank you madam mayor I 'll move the council the provisions of the section 89 2d of the Local Government Act 1989 to consider items 7.1 to 7.8 as these items relate to contractual matters thanks counselor pelts all those in favor motion carried _"

Bruce Hurley so please come forward Bruce thank you for allowing me to address the council on a matter of major importance to Lakes Entrance the development of bulla action and Development Association leader during the last eight months leaders membership has grown from 40 to 500 members as the town rallies to have a stronger voice to advocate for much-needed improvements to the town in May the largest ever town meeting was held in Lakes Entrance to discuss ways to improve Lakes Entrance for both residents and tourists despite its unique setting and importance for tourism in a Skip 's land the town was hurting because of several issues including reduced tourism aging infrastructure lack of attention to development these matters will highlighted by leader to you the council on your 4th of June council meeting the town meeting called for an injection of capital and energy to revitalize the town the meeting highlighted that the development of Bullock Island was its number one priority residents recalled lack of action to improve bulla Carlin despite 30 years of plans reports and recommendations his counselor Alice had pointed out bulla garland is a special place for recreational fishers as well as an excellent vantage point to observe the marine life and boats entering and leaving the lake system through and lack of landscaping it attracts hundreds of visitors and residents each weekend in the holiday season there was shock disappointment and bewilderment in Lakes Entrance when the community heard about the council 's decision to vote down the partnership agreement with Dell and its 10th of September meeting an agreement that was four years in the making and that would pave the way for Dave stage development of the island based upon the 2015 char endorsed Bullock island master plan the agreement has the show been responsible for the remaining crown land but not responsible for the expensive remediation and ongoing maintenance of the seawall this decision was battling his Lakes Entrance is so important for the tourist industry in his skips Lane and Bullock Island is such a valuable recreational asset and tourist attraction baffling because counsel had been briefed prior to its September meeting and the progress made in meeting its requirements to take over the management of the Crown land at Bullock Island the turns not asking for counsel to commit millions of dollars into immediate development we know that cannot happen we are asking you feature within East Gippsland and to seek further federal and state government funding as you have done for other coastal Crown land in his skips land the details of the partnership agreement has been has been diligently worked through the eyes have been dotted in the t 's have been crossed is an excellent and well-prepared document action is now required to end the neglect of bulla garland not more delays I urge you to pass the motion moved by canceled errors titled reconsideration of future land management arrangements public comment thank you mr. Haley councillor Alice thank you madam mayor for this opportunity to speak to motion number two 2019 reconsideration of future land management arrangements Bullock Island Lakes Entrance councillors can ask you to refer to the item not listed in the agenda at item two point one with a which features our recommendation in relation to actions that I put forward to is worthy of support for the partnership for the partnership being of Bullock Island by the East Gippsland Shire Council can I take it to councils of red this motion save me reading through the is publicly available on documents at the entrance to the chamber should members of the public wish to read it madam mayor I 'd like to speak to the motion and look for someone to second me with it thanks counselor retainer I 'm already second it thank you Thank You councillor Rutina madam it might have your indulgence thank you every community has a core location which helps to identify its being its culture a sense of belonging arguably Bullock Island is that location too many in the community of Lakes Entrance my hometown a location that interfaces with the vast majesty of the Gippsland lakes and the power and perils of its entrance a welcoming sight for those returning from the churning seas of the best straight it is a place though seemingly abandoned and tattered is the Cinderella of the lakes entrance for sure that is special so despite the tag and baggage it holds a highly valued appeal that offers so much joy and purpose to local and visitor alike so more passionate citizens tend to call it an iconic location counselors it 's now time a positive in both a cultural and economic sense I heard you to support the motion I put forward before you I now will refer to my rationale for this plea to Council the motion before you seeks council approval to enter into a partnership agreement with the Department of Land comes up a bigger pardon Department of Environment land water and planning Delp to appoint councillors the committee of management of the vacant and undeveloped open space on Bullock Island bikes entrance excluding the sea walls which is important the Shah has never had direct management responsibilities for the open space on Bullock Island that has lain with the crown with the Department of Environment water and planning being the crown reserve manager a sore point for many a sore point with its community frustratingly particularly from a public viewpoint council under the current and past land manager arrangement has been unable to contribute to works and improvements on the island to any real degree this inability to influence real improvement was exaggerated by councils inability to aid in attracting funding from other Victorian government sources for an asset acknowledged Delp Gippsland in meeting its many and varied responsibilities has suffered from reduced resources and funding for many years subsequently management of the many Crown land reserves under their care and in this case Bullock Island has been challenged the islands neglected neglected roads and surrounds picture no no better in an example of this struggle Council has long been recognized has long recognized his situation and I upon the election to council like others before me sought to seek a solution of the better management of Lakes entrances for Shore and town Gateway as both interconnect with each other this early work initially culminated in the Lakes Entrance foreshore plan which accounted for the entire urban lakes entrance for Shore west to the columnar jetty but disappointingly excluded Bullock Island that exclusion of howl was addressed in August 2015 when council after considerable community consultation and support adopted a master plan for Bullock Island this most this master plan as most would be aware sets out how the unoccupied areas of Bullock Island can be developed for open space purposes facilitate fishing and other passive recreational activities the and around the island the plan builds upon and creates an ideal tourist recreational precinct that adds to the economic and cultural aspects of the island though I came to accept management responsibilities so as to speedily implement the plan stage development council faced the dilemma of meeting the order of the island 's aging sea walls in its negotiations at that time a costing past that could not justifiably be placed on its ratepayers base by the council again the desired development of the island stalled pleasingly of much more recent time and it has been part of the renewed goodwill and state gave and initiative in coastal management practices Council can now confidently move to take responsibility for the sword after parts of the island more precisely it is now proposed the dolt will formally appoint counsel as the committee of management for the vacant and undeveloped open space on Bullock Island excluding all seawall interest ooh importantly under this arrangement dub will continue to source funding to repair and replace the deteriorating sea walls as part of the handover to Council the sea walls are not a of the ambitious ambitions of the master plan have been reported to Council to add an estimate of four hundred and seventy five thousand dollars over the various stages of the plan this cost includes a badly needed toilet road construction and passive recreational facility facilities such as shelters walking tracks tables seats and signage the plan is presented as a multi-year proposal in his ideally position to attract appropriate funding or grants from outside sources an action both counsel and DUP will work to by agreement I refer councils to Appendix 1 the draft partnership agreement as evidence of that dual commitment officers have initially reported an estimated annual maintenance cost of ninety seven thousand dollars assumingly based on the needs of the completed works of the master plan as highlighted in point 5 of the motion of the motion officers request officers to seek ways in which successfully reduced the burden of this cost as it matures to its full amount counselors this is a long overdue project that has strong local support and carry strong cultural societal and environmental and economic benefits to the community of Lakes it is worthy of support by all it is a process it is a proposition that ticks all the boxes I ask you once again to hold our plea support a motion of benefits all in East Gippsland whether they be resident or visitor Hale and Hardy or in need of a little passive respite Bullock island is one location and the sole current time project can meet all of these diverse community needs it is a true example of local government driven and community owned projects for your information I 've also very attached that appendix to the Bullock Island master plan for your reference and that appendix 3 I 've attached the officer recommendation and report of the ordinary meeting held here on the 10th of September 2019 as further background to this motion for your infamous assistance also circulated a series of photographs it was sent to me by mr. Peter Merrill a member of our Lakes Entrance community highlighting the beauty and the passive recreational opportunities of Bullock Island and a genuineness of the environment and and it 's wildlife counselors I I urge you to madam me thanks counselor Ellis councillor ratinho do you wish to speak thank you madam mayor thanks for the opportunity and thanks for sharing those great iconic photos cancer Alice madam mayor in supporting is I believe 0.6 now alleviates the concerns oh I was absent last month but have viewed the previous decision and I believe that that additional point now puts council in the in the right light and doesn 't impede any any future councils it basically holds this council harmless if anything untoward just crops out of the blue with you know without many any yeah so in supporting this motion I 'd like to clarify some of the unfounded comments and small-minded politics on how this decision was arrived last month I 'd firstly like to commend you madam mayor for the responsibility and leadership shown when this matter was last before council as I understood by many people particularly those in leadership growls no one likes to be in a position where you need to exercise a casting vote and as a chair this case last month you were put in that awkward position is that you must maintain the status quo and you certainly did that this position has led to additional information and the addition of 0.6 in this notice formation tonight I 'm supporting this notice of motion thank you madam e thanks counselor 18 are there further speakers counsel pouts yes I 'd also like to reiterate with my colleagues that I 'm much more happier to support this motion by to the previous one on the grounds that I am satisfied that there 's a good out the council when I guess the previous motion for most of us counselors we basically felt that there was no there was no there was a commitment from counsel but it actually didn 't state a monetary amount that we were committed for committing our community ratepayers funds for and the bottom line for me is this property needs to be developed further and I can I conclude with my counselor colleagues about this and the community but it can only be done so via state and federal grant funding which will be ran through the council body and it actually can government system so with that stated if we were to go against this it would actually mean funding that would be coming through from both state and federal government would not be easily accessible by any other government department so for us to be able to move forward with this the bottom line for me is the fact that we will be the guiding body of fund structures but we will be keeping an eye on the amount that is committed by rate payers funding to the exercise and I think that was probably the the situation that most counselors we 're not happy with it being a bottomless pit like some of the other legacy programs that we have such as the Raymond Island Ferry the best in point boat ramp and some of the other issues that we pay for out of ratepayers fund so we were just hedging our situation and making sure we went over committing ratepayers funds into the future with regards to the Bullock island development thank you thanks counselor pouts councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor and a nice piece of propaganda you concerns when it came to Council last month was it felt that there was too many open unfilled checks blank checks that were going forward with this but to see a few extra points here that the bolster up that council will look to relinquish access crown land access land that can be returned to the crown to recoup costs and that there 's going to be a report coming to the February 2020 meeting discussing the details on that I 'm feel much more confident supporting this motion so thank you thanks Council Robert 's any yeah if there 's no further speakers no counselor Ellis good thank you madam mayor just the rod reply just to clarify point six because I didn 't read the lengthy motion out in distance and I just want to draw councilors attention to that on sub 6 and I 'll read that to Council and that is that council notes that the partnership agreement will will be amended to stipulate that if there is any if there is an unacceptable cost burden to ratepayers and council be permits to relinquish committee of relinquished lands so this is the cleared to address the concerns that have been raised it is an action probably under recommendation that I would suggest that we would look to in any other further similar projects and I prefer to the omiai bike trail perhaps we should if in retrospect we should have had this said best which has been you know a cost burden to counsel and ratepayers and to any other sort of partnership group so that we have that insurance and the content and and confidence to go to our public and say that we are managing these facilities in a responsible manner that said and having referred and acknowledged the photographs and the changes I ask councillors to support the motion I presented to council this evening thank you thanks counselor Ellis I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously [Applause] item 2.2 is a notice of motion number 3 2019 economic stimulus and support package following buyer of Gippsland lakes commercial fishing licenses councillor retainer your thanks madam mayor I 'm taking that everybody has read this logical request to the relevant minister in terms of economic development and loss particularly to the flow and effect and circulating in our local economy the lake the loss of those fishing licenses in this buyback you know a very rough rule of thumb is that for every dollar loss you know it could have a three or four dollars impact on on the local community in other words it 's the reverse of actually when you create a job and unemployment is a major life event it has devastating impact on people 's lives it affects not just the unemployed person but also family members and the wider community the impact of unemployment can be long-lasting and devastating for a local town and regional economy apart from the absolute a no can I just um get a second to first before you went into it counselor Ellis sorry you were going to raid the motion sorry counselor Ellis was indicated the second so please that 's fine we 've read that what I 'm up to now the significant and severe impact of job losses on rural and regional expenditure is reduced further damage to local communities were resolved from people leaving in search of work thus and there 's another flaw in fact kids been taking our schools less requirements for medical so I think we all get the picture the stimulus and Support Package sought in this notice of motion is for our region should be similar to the support received in other areas of Gippsland it needs to include support for non license holders involved in the Gippsland Lakes commercial fishing sector and support is needed to assist affected individuals and their families transition to new career opportunities I urge my fellow councillors to support this motion tonight thanks counselor ratinho counselor Ellis do wish to speak very briefly madam mayor I endorsed councillor ratinho sentiment and vision in putting forward this motion it 's just yet another example of the blurring of lines between the various levels of government at the present federal or state and responsibilities in rep and with representatives supporting their communities we 've seen this without drought work that you 've been so strongly advocating for and we see it in we 're very strong as council to return our mind of need today when the buyback systems work they work well in heavily populated areas but in more sparsely populated areas such as the Gippsland lakes and in particular my town likes entrance we we suffer when people jobs are taken away from their region and this is the case here Council has been briefed on some of the frustrations and difficulties they likes fishermen have faced in relinquish in their licenses in the Lea lifestyle and I 'm hoping that this recommendation put before Council by Councillor ratinho will go some way in letting them know that the the Shire and people of East Gippsland support their support these families and that hopefully the government won receipt of the letter will respond in a favorable way to our community and our fishing families thank you thanks Council Atlas councillor pelts yes thank you madam may I to support this motion that councillor Tino has put forward I believed strongly that any primary producing industry whether it be the farming industry the timber industry or the fishing industry should have of job retentions jobs being taken away this should be affiliated to something similar to what has happened down in the Latrobe Valley with the closing of the mine and the restructuring of their community and nonetheless our community should be also reviewed in the same manner and it should be just a status quo that this is the type of transition if they 're choosing to close down our primary producing industries that are suffering anyway and our communities are getting smaller and our economic flow on effect that is demising from these cutbacks in economical times we are suffering in our out of areas of the Victorian region you know you might be busy down in Melbourne and you 've got other jobs to move on to but you 're taking jobs away from our communities you 're taking money away from our livelihoods and you 're not replacing it with any other jobs of similar status or of similar income generating positions to say that the tourist industry is going to cut the mustard while we 're still waiting for it to happen and so with that to write to the minister and for our community to know that this is support of what 's happening in our region and we feel for you and we do recognize the flow-on effects it 's really difficult and it 's hard out there and it 's only going to get worse with what we 're going through so thank you and with that I commend all other councillors to support this motion thank you thanks counselor pouts there any further speakers to the motion counts the return our writer for a pie thank you madam I just on the point of fairness in closing the debate I used some independent research about the fairness of what was being put forward as as fairness and I used our good friend Google Maps and if you look at the other areas that have had commercial netting buyouts you 're talking about curio bay Port Phillip Bay Western port Google Maps says they 're within one hour forty one hour 50 of Melbourne CBD interestingly Lakes Entrance is four hours 24 minutes so to say that people can easily transition to other particular East Gippsland it 's well-documented our areas of disadvantage and I just think that the government needs to help us with this transition package here Lakes Entrance thank you Thank You councillor retainer I 'll put the motion for you before you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you item three deferred business there is no deferred business mad at me thanks item four is counselor reports counselor tui Thank You Madame mayor I 'm a bit disappointed that that everyone 's not staying for my report never mind it was good to have you here anyway I have forwarded my report to two staff madam mayor and there 's one thing that I 'd like to highlight from the month I did a presentation at at the tennis courts in being staff the Australian money tournament and the junior tournament this is the third year in being star for the junior tournament and this year tennis Victoria added an Australian money tournament and because of that there were over well over 120 participants that competed in the event aiming to transition to into senior competitions is the fact that council are proud to support the the tournament there and did so by a two and a half thousand dollar grant and the other reason why I must say I was pleased to to present at that facility was the fact that my daughter did play there for a number of years and the major sponsor there Crain 's ash holding my son got his first full-time job there so the connection to the community through some of the things that we get to do as councillors is very real and it 's it 's something that I really enjoy doing thank you thanks counselor two accounts the retainer no thanks madam mayor I just like to report on a couple of things the I attended the most recent citizenship ceremony presided over by yourself as mere at the corporate centre here there were 17 candidates in 11 different countries represented there were three key moments in three discussions after the ceremony that really stuck in my mind the first was meeting Danilo who had been sponsored by me for a local business under a regional with his daughter taking the final step to become a stray citizens ii was an absolute interesting and bizarre discussion you just wouldn 't think this would happen in Australia there was a Ukraine couple that had fled their country and came to live in Sydney for a better life they had the misfortune of working for a lesson reputable Australian employer that I can only describe the conditions as explained to me as modern-day slavery the couple escaped the scenario and this story really gets interesting they ended up in Melbourne and through sheer coincidence and luck a local business owner Warren had his work vehicle in Melbourne with his business number on it and all he noticed the were cute and rang the number and Warren agreed to meet him and through long story short he was a very great grateful to be given the opportunity to work here in band style and he was a very experienced engineer in window glazing and went on to being a great contributor to that business and to our local community the third great example was a couple from India who again through that school migration program supporting a big need in our in our community for skills particularly in health the other thing I 'd like to speak to about tonight was the business awards the 29m Federation Business Awards held it Lakes Entrance recently it was held at Alvin Co and the event was well attended showcasing all the great businesses in East Gippsland but the highlight was a presentation by guest speaker sheriff destination Gippsland sue Smithers sue originally from Lakes Entrance is an accomplished national journalist holding many senior roles and working throughout Australia and recently she 's working in Melbourne for the Women 's Weekly the the highlights slides that she presented we 're headed as Gippsland world-class Wonderland she started off with our destination tourism is all around transformation suicided the derby tasmania case and just tonight we had a really good discussion with councillor roberts who visited there recently and was also blown away by the transformation so he believes that the same can be said about our own a mountain bike destination project that has been cited because of the world-class terrain it as as big as they can when they do this led to the next part of the presentation of storytelling on our region and this really made people sit back and take notice east gippsland is truly a world-class destination right here in Lakes Entrance we have the second longest stretch of uninterrupted beach in the world the Gippsland lakes is the largest and navigable lake system in australia lake system is home to truly a rare pod of dolphins a baron and dolphins and only 150 of these thousands of Abuk dolphins have been identified anywhere in the planet the only lake towards ponds will lose the longest silt jetty in the world a natural phenomenon through the forests there 's a cave system older than the pyramids the most visited tourist icon in East Gippsland sue said if Gippsland is the jewel in Victorians tourism crown then he skip saying is its diamond we all need to become better storytellers and tell the story of this remarkable place where we live work and play we 're all in the business of tourism thank you mad at me thanks highlights for me from the month of September I attended the Gippsland wine show to present on behalf of the mayor I presented the award for best cap save the Shire contributed two thousand dollars the event with more than a hundred wines from keeps lamb being entered was an extremely well attended evening with some very very good wines on show and happy to say that local selador Lightfoot and Sons that extremely well and took home some of the most prestigious awards for the night so congratulations to them another highlight was the exhibition launch of rayon to really Thomas moon geun and lit at Lisa Roberts flying foxes and disappearing trees and Louise Chris from glide poems this is the East Gippsland art gallery and once again on behalf of the mayor I was able to open the exhibition um something pretty close to me my mom had an exhibition there that was one of her shows the flying foxes and disappearing trees which is very topical at the moment but it was a packed evening with a really really enthusiastic crowd and just shows how important on such a shoestring budget I think they do a fantastic job the exhibition was beautiful haunting and thought-provoking and you really really should go and check it out it runs till October 19th so that 's my report thank you thanks councillor Roberts councillor Buckley thank you madam mayor Sunday before last at our monthly meeting for the bench style arrow Club I here put a presentation to the club members which was very enthusiastically received and that 's the start of it up there as you can see and I was nearly gonna bring along the real thing but was decided to do it better this way and anyhow in a word World War two as you know was a pretty hectic time around here and at the drôme there there 's these old gun pits most of them have been filled in now but this particular one as wouldn 't take a lot to restore it and the club members seem to be very enthusiastic about supplying the the labor to do it and so forth so it wouldn 't be of any expense to the show can see this that 's the Lewis gun incidentally and that 's the frame it used to sit on the axial part that goes up further to use the gun as an anti-aircraft gun is missing but all that stuff can be really restored and remanufactured and I I 've got a contact that could make a more accurate model of the Lewis gun and so and as you can see there 's a little bit of concrete at in the bottom right hand corner looking at lefty a right hand corner looking this way and there 's a that 's a blast room if you like a a where the Gunners would flee into there and things got too hot obviously and that 's bomb-proof then it 's a room were three meters by two or three meters and that 's store their ammunition and stuff in there and so it was sort of decided tentatively decided it 's early days yet that the club had press onon and and get that particular project completed you can see those pieces of wood just underneath the barrel of the Lewis that 's all that 's left of that one because various fires over the years have burnt them away and anyway as I said before the club was very enthusiastic and and band style of course I should know was there was quite a complex around here defense complex connected to a radar station on feed breweries property at nine Gerner and we 've also located a bunker down there where they used the power source for the radar station and it was all interconnected with the huge defense complex and the really had to take this very seriously defending the southeast coast because if the Battle of the Coral Sea hadn 't have been a draw in 1942 things could have been quite different and the Japanese have retreated back to the mall with their invasion force and consequently they never got we 're going destroy to continue that attack so the questions I have I supposed to the Shire would we be able to to do oh go ahead and start this project or would we need a motion from the Shire to go ahead with it okay be done at another time so basically there we have it there 's our other things I 'd like to tell you but there 's other people want to speak as well so thank you madam me your attention thanks counselor Buckley and officers we 'll get back to you at a later point in relation to your questions counselor Ellis machine gun no it 's downstairs all right I 've got run through my report which is being prepared and lodged I 've had another extremely busy month with a series of meeting commitments both within and outside of Council and meaning when a large number of members of our community a couple of civic events worthy of mentioning

many events that I attended in this last month quickly run through a torch relay that came into been style and then headed off towards Melbourne also as council ratinho said the I attended the citizenship ceremony and I was I was really surprised at the number of people who had decided to become Australian citizens and make East Gippsland their home and I welcome them all wholeheartedly the there 's the been style Computer Club attended their meeting behalf of Council as as council gave them a grant to to buy some more equipment for their club and it was it was great to see their mostly older people who I shouldn 't say would be struggling with computers but they are there is a group teaching one another the things that they 've learned before a meeting just inverted ly things that they 've learned on the computer and they 're happy to share that with their friends and they 're a great bunch of people so I commend them for for their effort and in helping one another to to catch up with this besides that I can say God honestly I haven 't caught up with yet then we the Paintsville foreshore a couple of weekends ago which was the the Craft Centre and what a great group of people hard-working passionate using their skills to produce everything from knitted garments to to jams and relishes and all sorts of other things but what came out of that was the the fact that they had on the wall all of the their own community organisations that the money they 'd raised they had then donated back to Paintsville community groups and for example the school the CFA the Scout group and many many more so it 's it 's wonderful to see that they have this great friendship this ability to produce things from from scratch and then sell it to community who wish to go through that that really really nice building there on the foreshore and at the same time also they they share one of the weekends with with another room with the with the in style Mitchell Mitchell River Rotary Club who hold a market down there and one of the members of that Club Ellen kindly donated a check from rotary to them which was really really great for him to do that and they accepted that gratefully we we also had the the AG group give us a presentation again at our drought reference group last Monday and for their ideas to to develop strategies around different plant groups at Mesut our environment as we go into this phase of dryness and you know they 're very passionate and the wonderful thing that came out of the Premier 's visit here it was that they were they have been well truly funded for that proposal so that was really good news and also the the rates consultation they even the other night the the the chair of that got quite a surprise and it was that was well represented by councils this council group got quite a surprise that the number of councillors who were in attendance and then an even bigger surprise because he 'd suggested that they get perhaps four or so members of the public to come to the second part of the meeting and here it was about 60 people turned up in the gallery so I think he see some change in the rating system so well it 's a lot thank you thanks counselor counselor pouts thank you madam mayor I 'd like to recognize the works of the recently formed or boss branch of the CWA ladies who since reinstatement have been working hard to fundraise together base funding to establish its branch back in the all boss 'd region and the passion behind the girls working hard is unmeasurable of wanting to help their drought ridden community and help where it 's necessary so I 'd like to recognize them for their contribution and hope they look towards us for a bit of support with regards to some of the networking stuff that our council was involved in during the previous month I 've been busy advocating for our region at the mov transport infrastructure meeting we 're V Maps is working on principle freight networks with rail and road national transport reviews which identify the eight most useful national freight routes which of course our princess highway is one of them and to know that that being recognized in many places is I 'm in regards to the seats Transport South East Australian Transport Systems group and it 's sort of all nation together really nicely it was recognised that sharing of risk and responsibilities for government bodies to comply with the National heavy vehicle ready regulator guidelines was an area that staff need to upskill a bit more in and that they 'll be might be doing some skill some staff skill networks with them we 're waiting for the exciting release policy paper mid-october for innovative mobility devices such as hoverboards ebikes and dare I say the electric scooter which I can 't wait for it to be coming in and out and around our region so I 'm looking forward to that and hopefully we 'll be able to get some for our tourists around our region too so it was identified that the Department of Transport and it may be transport and infrastructure should be working together in areas such as roads safety school crossings speed zones and rail crossings we felt they were the areas that were most significant to all of the outer urban areas and the next very interesting guest speakers and one in particular which I 'd like to enlighten you too was from the Department of Transport and he confirmed to us that works on the Avon bridge would start shortly and would be due to commence late 2020 the new bridge would run adjacent to the old construction and would be capable of taking speeds of up to 90 kilometers an hour which is much more than the current 10 kilometers an hour which we have to travel at now on the trains and also I attended the Council 's induction meeting and basically the meeting afterwards was in regards to the mayor or forum it 's happening next week which rule counts as is the host of so basically we were just aligning our reviews and we 've got some funding things that we were addressing tomorrow lastly I had the honor of representing our mayor in the official opening of the let me be myself exhibition which was based on the story of Anne Frank and it 's an exhibition set up on the mezzanine floor or the library here in beam-style 's a very interesting exhibition it 's compelling and it 's quite confronting with a lot of explanation about the horrific wall deeds that happened at that time in 1947 so to go in there and look at people 's resilience and you know how they had to leave it was just they 've got a little a little statue of the house and in which section they lived in and I think most people have read the book of the Diary of Anne Frank and it 's it gives you a bit more enlightenment into the story so thanks counselor pouts just a couple of things from me grand final day I was privileged enough to go and welcome one hundred and about a hundred volunteers at the anglers risk camp and ground to the 3rd annual friends in the middle fundraise a fundraiser give back volunteer day so we saw volunteers from all over the state come together with Parks Victoria to plant trees install signage and undertake general maintenance along the Middle River and the Friends of the meadow in particular Jeff and Carrie Aronson who have all of these volunteers to get together and do all of that work which is a massive job so well done to them and the last thing I just wanted to talk about was the visit we had from the Minister of Agriculture and the premier who came to announce further drought funding to support our drought affected communities which we knew it was the first time the premier had visited a Skip 's land for many years and it was great to have ministers sons return to East Gippsland I think it was about the third or fourth time she has been down in the last ten months so she 's shown some great support to our region we met on site at the demonstration site which council what referred to in his report from the Gippsland agricultural group the funding package announced 400,000 to them and other funding for immediate and future focus needs which also included one and a half million dollars to council to assist in meeting the immediate needs of the farming affected community and businesses also continuation of the infrastructure and pasture grants and run by the CMA so we were very thankful for this announcement and also reinforced our strong advocacy that we have been working on over the last year on behalf of our farmers and communities and we will decide in the coming weeks on how we will distribute that funding from the state and I 'll leave it at that which leads us into 5.1.1 the council representation review and the CEO thank you madam mayor 5.1.1 yes council representation review which is very timely given the amount of representation that just been described to the chamber there was a resolution this reports based on a resolution from council from the 5th of February that a comprehensive review of the councillor committee representation inclusive of industry forums be completed it was hoped that the resolution asked for that to be brought to the May meeting unfortunately June mostly to actions that I undertook in terms of restructuring the organization we were unable to to meet that deadline but we have presented that now for your consideration the reviews confirmed that council membership of and represent representation on a wide range of East Gippsland community and I think that was one of the critical questions that councillors were looking to answer through this review there is a suggestion that we could discontinue representation on some of the forums that councillors are currently our Council is currently represented on and they 're outlined in the report it also the review also identified the fact that we are in fact managing and administering their the representation generally in line with other local governments however we 've identified some areas for improvement so those recommendations are there in front of you and I would just like to highlight probably in recommendation three in particular that there 's a further policy brought to Council in November which would actually outline some of the processes in more detail and that in particular the delegates would be required to submit a report for inclusion in the next council meeting so this is about making sure that the information that is garnished by a particular councillor is then actually made available to the rest of the council which happens informally at the moment this formalizes it but is has occurred and in particular there you 'll note the neck the second point there talks about the minutes of those meetings where possible because sometimes they may not be able to be circulated but where available they are circulated so I would put those recommendations to Council for consideration thanks mr. CEO there any questions if I may madam I asked the CEO what taking into account the current practices of council at the moment which is a council decision for the appointment of representing to the various committees in and outside forum what more formal practices he envisioned that is not already practiced through you madam mayor thank you for the question counselor Ellis it is about that a number of these things are practice as you described and are not necessarily captured in a formal procedure or policy so that that can be clearly articulated one of the changes that 's being proposed is also around the term of appointments at the moment those terms of appointment are for four years and what we 've identified is that throughout the term of counsel counselors take on different 's looked at twelve monthly is not actually a determination of the of the 12 months and we 're suggesting that the appointment be for delegates to be 12 months in that that doesn 't mean that a that a counselor cannot continue to be the representative it just means that it 's formally reviewed at 12 months ya think thanks mister see I 'm concerned that councils maintain control of their their own actions and and report back to Council have no difficulty but I I just feel that it 's it 's a decision of council and it shouldn 't be too formally structured so that counselors are influenced on what what amount of work is associated with the reporting process or tendencies rather than the the will to to represent their community and their council by their own free will thank you council pulse yes thank you madam mayor I 'm just curious with the representation on the ones that are being discounted or discontinued a lot of those groups haven 't met and I think the issue here is the fact that within these times some like the UM professional development reference group or the Human Services Committee and none of these groups have actually met in the three years that we 've currently been on this council so again the underlying question is actually for to know whether the mov is going to continue with these groups in the format but also knowing they branch into the advocacy role of us you know campaigning ministers and their advisors because this is where these groups actually stem from so any of the MOV ones you usually talking with administer the ministers advisers on issues that are confronting your community so that 's basically what these these committees are for but if that one two three four five six groups hasn 't met in the three or three years that we 've been on this council there 's no reason to say we 're going to completely adhere to them because they haven 't met further questions counselor tyno you 're happy to move do we have a seconder councillor tui cancel retain I do wish to speak just like to thank the work that 's gone to me it just highlights the you know that we 're seeking to get best value for our community and continue to do that so I urge the councillors to support the motion Thank You councillor we thank you madam may I I 'm obviously on a couple of these and I must say I have seen the benefit that comes to comes to our community from being being in these in these committees and so forth and I concur with councillor ratinho value-for-money is what we 're about you know committees not meeting there 's no point having them in there but happy to happy to go with this thanks thanks counselor to e as Baker against but I 'd just simply like to remind councillors the importance of the nav and the advocacy role can be taken and the doorways that are opened by being members of the mavey the recommendation before us in relation to these somewhat inactive counts commit subcommittees at the moment are relevant but once once we head off into state and federal election periods these committees not only provide good information at a style they provide a state-level they also provide us with the opportunity for a stronger advocacy role and we need to take advantage of it so in supporting the recommendation as it stands at present I ask Council is not the closed door on the can we can 't in on the on these subcommittees and and that perhaps at a later time when there 's a nativist you role necessary that we consider reviewing our position and membership by those subcommittees recalling that we are members of the MA V as a as a council so we take advantage of what services they provide thank you thanks counselor Ellis any further speakers I put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously item five point one point two draft local law number one procedures for council meetings good evening councillors madam mayor I 'd like to speak on the draft local law number one procedures for council meetings this was advertised in during this year or given notice for public notes our submissions seven submissions were received one of which pertained in relation to the relation to the time frames relating to public speaking time a section two to three committee was convened and keep the committee of council determined to make some modifications to some of the wording which have now been incorporated into the local law so the report and the changes are now presented for councils consideration in potentially adopting the local law number one thanks mister alone any questions councillors counselor Ellis thanks I wonder if you could remind me what actual changes to the local law have actually been made in this particular revision Thank You Kinsler else the one pertaining to the definition for acted upon the request from at the committee hearing was that the terminology for the definition be simplified so the wording has actually been simplified now key difference being that there was a term used called materially affected so now we 're just generalizing that as affected and essentially making sure that anything that 's being practically incapable of being rescinded is noted as being so such the other chord change relation to the timeframes for public speaking time so the draft proposed a speaking the feedback received the decision was basically decided to revert back to the five minutes from the previous local law that we heard from 2017 sorry it did counselor I always have a follow-up for it 's just to give people the understanding where 'd this arose from I accept that we reverted back so and there 's no question then it comes back to the the question of acted upon now is that based that and fresh definition it has that arisen from the fact of the debate counsel had earlier in the year in relation to the mineral sands debate when we were arguing on the issue of what was recently acted up acted upon what did that mean he said how this has come to be yes I understand that is the case counselor pouts can you just clarify the five-minute and I was sure there was some section that was in there saying unless determined otherwise by the chair prior to any speaker addressing counsel yes the the correct wording or the wording that was actually been reverting to is unless determined otherwise by the chair item each speaker on that item will be allowed to no more five minutes and if I may just have a clarification that the chair actually can determine a lesser time if if the chair wishes to and it is actually determined by the person that is in the chair at the time oh yes that is correct that 's unless unless determined otherwise by the chair prior to any speaker yes palace council house mr. CEO did you wish to clarify oh yes thank you madam it just to add further to councilor else 's question before on page 187 of the agenda there is actually a tract changed version of the local law so that actually tracks all the changes that have been made because I think it 's important to understand that in fact there are more changes than just the speaking time and weather and the definition of acted upon and this came about because there had been a number of sort of gray areas if you like and it was important that those gray areas were in fact clarified which is what brought this to I think somewhere in the vicinity of four or five sessions around this particular local law looking at all the elements of the law it 's a really important law it 's how we run out our our meetings and it 's really important that it 's clear and that officers are and counselors are able to understand what 's in it Thanks council retainer thanks counselor pouts council retainer do you wish to speak again madam ear there 's significant work that goes in to get these documents right and particularly an important document like our local law it does become law and there 's a very structured and dedicated process which takes a lot of energy and effort to keep it right so thank you and I just support this motion and hope that my colleagues will support it as well thanks counselor pouts yes I 'd like to recognize everyone that 's come in to contribute to the hearing that we heard and I think we have negotiated their points around the table and taken their guide in their guidelines into perspective and and I feel we to be able to support councillor Tino and recommend to our fellow councillors the new updated version of the local laws that we feel has been contributed to by the community from those who did actually come in and chat to us about their issues with it so thank you and thank you to the staff for hearing and following suiting appeasing to the guidelines thank you thanks counselor parts counts for our C 's speaking against for with an observation and that that is that this is probably one of the most important talk miss Council has because it provides good governance and an open and fair fair reasonable debate on any subject that comes before council so this is important that we get this JA can 't write on a humorous note mad at me I 'm particularly pleased to see that we haven 't put that damn time time clock into our local law that it just sits there and it 's not part of their our process and that you madam chair have the right to decide on the time of the speaker rather than a this a he 's an important thing there are some giant there are some amendments that have been put forward and they come from experience from from the different meetings that we 've experienced over the past 12 months so I commend like the other councillor Tino and council thoughts the nation before Council thank you any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously item five point one point three proposed road renaming extension of Giles Street miss Liz Collins thank you madam mayor the report before you tonight is seeking council 's endorsement I 'm to rename sections of roads around the newly constructed Giles Street bridge the Java Street bridge created a thoroughfare from Bosworth Road straight through to Del Mar High Street and has resulted in the need to rename some sections of roads in that area the report before you tonight is a requirement in terms of gaining council 's endorsement for the proposal for the Office of geographic place-names who managed the process of renaming and so there is recommendation there before you tonight there are attachments the roads as they 're proposed to be there is no impact on any private members of the community the area that 's being renamed aligns along the boundaries of council properties thank you madam me thanks miss Collins questions caps lapels happy to move can for our second yes I do I just like to say look this is the best bit of Road that joins our community especially from the industrial section and for it to have a such a great name as Giles Street as a continuation makes common sense to me so happy to support the recommendation from the offices it 's an important piece of the structure that 's after 25 or more years thank you thanks Council parts count sir Alistair about anything there 's nothing to say it 's an administrative matter that just planning like sense thank you Thanks no further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thanks miss Collins item 5.1 point for proposed locality boundary amendment hillside and bends Dale thank you madam mayor this also is another report in regards to for in Victoria so this is about the boundary very alignment between hillside and Ben style and the current boundary which goes through the middle of a number of properties which is not obviously ideal in terms of place naming the proposal is to move the boundary and extend it which fits in line with the bends Dale growth area as well there are two impacted properties and those owners have been directly contacted and have not made any response to those there has been community consultation undertaken in accordance with the requirement of the office of geographic place names and for this to go forward the office of geographic place names requires endorsement of counsel at a council meeting in terms of the proposal and there 's a recommendation there tonight for councils consideration thanks miss Collins questions no questions counts the white you 're happy to move councillor Tory seconding councillor what do you wish to speak yes I do it 's it 's worthy to do what we are doing with the repositioning of the sign of well side of I 'm passionate that 's not not that actually like to see that they are identified around the Shire with these place names they are the signs of Hillside of been shifted a few times and just like to say that that at one stage the first attempt the one closest to Linden I was positioned so as to dissect a house and Debbie Stewart would would say that she she she slept in Linden hour of an evening but she got up and had her breakfast in Hillside it was positioned so well so that 's that 's also been rectified but I think it 's worthy of council to to recognize these communities and the signage means a lot to those people who live there thanks Council what counselor 2e_._4908.26 thank you madam it absolutely correct counselor what good administrative thing to do and just to clear up some anomalies any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thanks miss Collins 5.2.1 regional and district event sponsorship round one 2019-20 assessment welcome mister clinics thank you madam mayor the purpose of the report is to seek council sponsorship program around 1 2019 20 the raids or commonly known as raids program has been going for many years and continues to successfully funded vents that create direct and indirect economic benefit to East Gippsland the benefits are largely created by attracting visitors from around Victoria interstate and internationally to the region twice a year the raids program invites event organizers to apply for funding this round we receive 12 applications which riverfront which we 've had been reviewed by panel and nine of the 12 applications have been recommended for funding with some of those over a three-year period which enables those events to have certainty in funding as grow and become more sustainable of good luck tonight of the three events not funded one of those events was not funded because we 've been it 's been funded for three years and we 've requested it to become a self-sustaining event a second event council officers realize it is quite important and have decided to fund it separately out of the economic development budget and a third application was not considered an event and deemed ineligible for which is well appreciated by event organizers and for the investment made by council it delivers a significant economic benefits for our region full details of each application are in the report thank you there any questions from the council 's counselor tui can I ask the question do you have any idea of the of the overall benefit that that is derived by our community from this investment that we make we we 've done that we 've presented to council rapport on that about 12 months ago I can come back to you with some of those results are you counselor tyno Thank You councillor pout second councillor Tanner do you wish to speak sorry before he moved the motion Kalibak we mid light in supporting this motion madam mayor I 'd really take my hat off to all all the events and things that we are supporting in our community that they are really important events and sponsorships not just by promoting the event itself but the the fact that quite often they attract outside people to our region and there 's a really interesting statistic around from people who once visited the region as a tourist and that 's why we 're all in the business of tourism and events play an important role but thank you thanks counselor Tina accounts for pelts that does not just say look I 'm really excited looking at the list that 's being funded because there 's some really unusual things which I haven 't seen before and the cannery of the community centers hosting a passing of the endeavor which is a national monumental event which I think 's great and you know then there 's the Lunar New Year celebration in Lakes Entrance the wild fight boxing for the males Eastern Valley Street rodders down in Lakes Entrance is able to have a cruise and some of these events they actually bring bring more substance to the area and I know for instance the hot rodders you know they 'll really appreciate that they 'll have a great night they 'll probably have a band and a bit of a dinner and then a cruise the next day after Painesville spreading their you know the economy generator is another one they 've got the national championships happening and you know 2019 I think they held it last year as well and to be able to hold it two years in a row it 's it 's fantastic for our region so all in all looking at these events it 's a great cross-section to our community and you know I really think it 's worthwhile for council to be able to sponsor and I 'm really proud to be able to be supporting these tonight thank you thanks cancer part so there any further speakers count 4 to e I 'm Stephen just in regards to my question earlier on it was only to try and quantify the benefit to our community and and I would imagine that this this small investment would come back to us tenfold by the the money that is put into our community by the people that attend these events so my point with my question was it 's such a good investment on behalf of our community money absolutely well spent thanks counselor 2e any further speakers do you wish to put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously five point two point two endorsement of the parliamentary inquiry into tackling climate change in Victorian communities submission welcome Karthik thank you madam mayor good evening councillors the purpose of this report is to seek endorsement from Council and it 's a written submission prepared by the offices to the Victorian legislative assemblies with environment and planning committees parliamentary inquiry into tackling climate change in Victorian communities attached to the report and the submission that 's been prepared by the offices the in a nutshell the submission basically gives an overview of what council officers have been working on in terms of projects and with the community to combat climate change and what sort of initiatives have been taken within East Gippsland and in Victoria in terms of these projects and combating climate change and getting some outcomes through the projects but also the submission identifies some gaps in how the state government and other federal government can work with the local governments especially in pertaining to East Gippsland in terms of working together to combat the terms of projects and initiatives within East Gippsland and how we can achieve better outcomes in terms of policies programs and funding so that 's the submission for your endorsement thank you thank you there questions which transport Buckley yeah I know this is a tickly subject but it 's a could we suggest that we perhaps change the name this is still a climate change to climate cycle because we 've had climate cycles going on since the beginning of of time I don 't suppose time starts or stops but you know if we didn 't have climate change and climate cycles would be still with the dinosaur and you know I think it 's you know could be looked at it in in a in a less hysterical way miss why would you wish to answer that Thank You councillor Buckley the terms of reference for fairly clear thought what the parliamentary inquiry was looking at and it wasn 't around the terminology and how we described climate change or climate emergency there 's a I think called global warming at one stage it was really about are around and some of the initiatives that can be undertaken so in drafting the submission we actually had to respond to the terms of reference councillor Alice you 've moved there councillor Roberts yeah pretty second yep councillors do wish to speak this shows the importance of local government in dealing with state government policy as we 're counselors are all aware their current state government have a strong policy in relation to addressing the perils of climate change that face our communities across the widest state and in doing so they have placed up a series of expectations of all levels of government as Karthik rightly pointed out there was a series of gaps identified by our sustainability officers who are working to meet the requirements of the climate change act and our other risk societal respects patience this submission I recommend to all counselors who have not who may not have read it and to members of the public if they can access this to have a read to understand the power the importance of local government in addressing the challenges that face our communities at the council thanks counselor Ellis councillor Roberts you should add anything no there any further speakers to the motion I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor against motion is carried seven one thanks council Buckley thanks Karthik five point two point three addition of roads on councils Road register welcome mr. Marc Bennett thank you madam mayor and councillors the report before you seeks recommendation to add eight roads to councils public road register two sorry the total of Rock those roads equates to six point eight seven kilometers in length the first two of those roads better Road and Center Road run through the mallacoota foreshore reserve of which council is the manager of and they access that those roads access important recreational places of interest in that area the roads subsequent to those Dickerson 's Lane Cemetery Road Casey Creek track sterling Road service lane Nicholson Creek Road and Eagleson track are all all have principal places of residence on them so people live there permanently and that is one of the key criteria for adding roads through the public road register the the last propose to not add those to the public road register immediately we like the benefiting owners of those properties on that road to upgrade the road to or the roads to councils minimum requirements prior to at which time we would in add them to the public road register thank you thank you questions counselor Ellis sorry I had until preparation for this meeting I hadn 't seen this report so I 'm sorry for these questions I 'm just recalling the Casey Creek Road which you 've just advised advised and coat the Casey Creek Road it at taller on you you advised that that not to be added at the present time to that it 's condition to the roads register on recalling that Casey Creek Road was added to our register some several years ago and that it 's been in fact it may well have been on their register for some time am i incorrect in that recollection don 't thank you cancel Ellis there is a section the initial section of Casey Creek Road currently on the register of public roads so that may be a continuation it also includes a section of Eagleson tract which leads to one principal place of residence in chula long so just to close okay good thanks for that I 'm thinking of this area here now does that also a but state state for us to go in State Forest there that 's correct yeah Casey Creek Road sorry Casey Creek track provides direct access to the crown land thinks about it says conversation was to have it another time in relation to partnerships thank you question council what thank you Madame Maris just questioning the two that you 're proposing the owners upgrade is there a reason for that are they new residents further along a road or or have they been responsible for the degrading those roads were traditionally unsurfaced roads there they the residents have constructed new properties down there new residences this is a very common requirement that if we are to take a road on to the public road register that the benefiting owners do upgrade the roads to councils minimum standards which is gravel and unusually drainage components there has been instances with the residents and we do make that offer sometimes we have installed drainage culverts and head walls and so on and we have actually put gravel materials down if they 've purchased those materials so we do offer a bit of a helping hand in that regard council pouts just looking at the the ones that you 're actually saying yes to adds up to five point one two kilometres and the estimated value of paving or gravel reseating the road pavement of the roads including in the report cost is a hundred and two thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars with ongoing expenses of routine maintenance is that right or is that is that amount does that include the other [Music] 1.75 kilometres yeah that 's that correct that 's the full the full six point eight seven kilometres and the ongoing annual maintenance is ten thousand three hundred and seven dollars can you just confirm given the fact that we 're not including the two properties in the last two Road reserves in this it will it be it 'll be slightly less than that amount yes the distance that 's it 's there the cost factors have been calculated on on distance unit rates counselor I always have a question yeah it 's a piece of trivia really and I 'm hoping one of you can answer it and I 'm just thinking with these additions to our roads as they come along can you tell us what the total distance of the road council is responsible for now that we would call council roads versus what 's with in Ayrshire I believe Council or else we 've got two thousand eight hundred and ninety seven kilometers so we 're we 're reaching almost three thousand kilometers and as a previous CEO used to state if you put that end on end it did stretch between bands dale and cans madam mayor that 's just a substantial asset maintenance issue for me thank you there 's no further questions councillor tui moving council retain a second do you wish to speak counselor tui just briefly to say thanks for the work this is this is good for our community and it also means that we can thanks counselor Tina I do wish to add anything I any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you item five point three point one alternative motion planning application number 43 slash 2017 p5 Penrose place Newlands are multi lot subdivision considered by Council on the 10th of September 2019 welcome mr. Hawley thank you madam mayor madam mayor and councillors I wish just to give a bit of background on this particular matter because sometimes these things do not seem straightforward the application was presented to the September council meeting with an officer recommendation to issue a notice of decision to grant a permit subject to conditions the officer recommendation was put to the vote and lost however as no alternative motion was put forward for councils consideration the application was not formally determined and hence the reason for this addendum report tonight for clarity councils the total number of objections as of noon on Monday 3rd September is 77 with an additional objection having been confirmed this week and a submission was also lodged with Council expressing support for the September council meeting council staff have been informed that the applicants consultants have launched an application review with the Victorian civil administrative tribunal that application for review has been on councils failure to make a decision on this application as a result of the application for a review being lodged councillors no longer in a position to make a decision but it is required to form a position on the proposal this position is what council will take to V count when the matter is heard although the officers recommendation remains as per the original report which is in the attachments to this report the intention of council was indicated at previous meeting and that the motion consistent with the officers recommendation was put to Council and lost possible alternative motion including grants for council position is provided below for council consideration should councillors seek to move it happy to take questions thank you thanks mr. hollow question counselor Ellis thank you madam mayor this is a question that 's been explored in council chamber but not in the public and and you have provided an announcer in your lot of people like myself at the time could not understand this and this was that the matter was brought before this council table on the 10th in September the matter was discussed and examined and council made a decision not to support the recommendation of the officers that being so my my feeling was that was an action of council in that they rejected the recommendation before council you have explained to Council but I 'm wondering if you can explain to us in the chamber that that explanation is too wide that is deemed not to have been an action because it 's it 's something that I would think most people would say that if council refuses an application they have acted upon something and as a result the appeal process that 's bent as being taken place by the applicant in taking the matter to the UK directly is confusing so what if we can help clarify that thank you thanks counselor so as I was in the chamber on the September councilors moved the rickum the officer recommendation and determined not to accept that recommendation formed another or made a decision on the application after that so councillors the officer recommendation in the report was not supported but yet there was no formal decision with respect to the application whether that was therefore refused the application which seemed to be the intent of councils of the night any further questions counsel counsel retain no sorries moved it counselor Roberts yep in a second it deuce to speak counselor Tanner just briefly madam mayor I was away that meeting but I did put myself through a bit of pain and watch the the meeting and I you know it was unfortunate there was a point where you asked the gourry our chamber for an alternate motion that wasn 't taken up so here we are it 's a technical issue what 's the tidy up it 's clean up yeah so I 'm happy to move it thank you thanks counselor Tanner sir Roberts to add anything just to reiterate counsel the ratinho this is the council could not make a decision on this this is just to form in a form a point of view so I just like to support this and as council Bertino said it 's an administrative issue and if we would have not make a decision if this motion was to be lost this recommendation was to be moved and lost tonight it would leave us in a bit of an odd limbo state at V can so no thank you any further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against motion is carried seven one councillor we against you item five point three point two is the quick response capital fund policy welcomes to Wayne Richards thank you madam an so councillors this items regarding review of what was the capital discretionary fund policy this is a fund that provides budget for small capital projects of high value or high community value but in a manner that 's responsive and transparent policy through the through the policy review there 's been three changes proposed the first being the title and from capital discretionary fund policy to quick response capital fund which we thought was more reflective of the actual of the actual and that is now using what the capital budget holding account which is now available and again we find that this allows us to be a bit more responsive with this program and finally the allowance to use operational budget which again allows us to fund some of those projects that are out there that don 't quite fit our capital budget processes but are still capital works within our community which we believe are of Y value so the draft policy is provided and recommendation is before you thank you are there any questions Thanks councillor tain I moved councillor to a second do you wish to speak counsel retainer I think anything that says quick response is a great message to our community and I 'll come in the work that 's gone into it thank you can 't we any further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you item five point three point three a Skip 's land new energy technology roadmap business case thanks Scotty thank you madam an this report is basically an overview relation to the East Gippsland new technology technology roadmap business case which is presented as Appendix one of the support and it gives an overview of what the project entailed and how it was delivered and executed the project basically was delivered in two stages one was working with the community understanding the need and the requirement and the policies that compliment the changes and the new energy technology roadmap but also well the outcome was that the technical report which supported the activities around community engagement in participation but it also looked at identifying projects that could form the policies and you know fit within the core council plan of to combat not just climate change but also help businesses to achieve sustainable outcomes so the stage two was basically look at three different projects which our officers worked on the multi-site feasibility study solar bulk pie and Energy Information hub all three of which have delivered some positive outcomes and that 's been highlighted in the report however the the overall trends and the momentum of these projects is governed by the changes in the national energy market highlighted in this report as well so attached is the report for Council to note and also publicly release the report so that 's councillor Roberts has a question thank you madam mayor granted this is this may not be the the the question that the forum to ask this question but given the success of the programs does there do you believe there would be a decision to to renew these projects especially things like the solar bulb by which I think it was very valuable council offices you know chain ability Department are working on identifying more projects where we could fit retrofit these projects on a demonstration not just a pilot scale there are there 's more research and and looking for fundings foreign funding opportunities as well and we 're looking at not in the immediate future but in probably in the following years that this project will be implemented in on a larger scale little market adjustment so we 're seeing quite an adjustment in the market now we 're introducing and the state government is now introduced its own program of incentives so they now frees up our resources to take another project it 's really good to hear if County do you foresee the council could potential could potentially consider another bolt by program for technology like store battery storage technology watching with face really carefully and looking at what happens in the market is chaotic said this is a rapidly changing market so part of who 's watching what 's going on looking for where those those opportunities or perhaps those gaps that we can apply for funding for and look at those and he says tax attorneys earlier report on the climate change initiative part of this part of our submission was about identifying some of those gaps as the technology advances was certainly looking for opportunity to work out how we can make that affordable accessible to our communities and our community Thanks okay counselor oh it 's moved counselor Ellis second it do you wish to speak I think counsel has been taking a really forward-thinking stance on a lot of these programs and the solar Bob by was a great success and I know many people that took that it 's not a climate cycle a lot of the vast majority of climate scientists or Pearlie all believe vast majority of them believe that this is not a cycle and that globally globally human beings and their their emissions do have a global impact on the climate cycle as it 's now called climate change so I think it 's really good that councils taking the forward step and I hope to see more results in the future thanks council Robert 's counselor Ellis do should add anything I can 't_''_6824.909 after that and I just simply seriously just want to say they do on reading the report you can see the good work that 's been done in the success of Ovaltine alternative solar power and another factors that we attack we are addressing in our council and it 's a worthy worthy piece of work and we look forward to the next edition Fiona thanks council hours council pouts I just like to say you know this is great to see this report come to the table and initially when we the energy-saving avenues that council what five years ago now the solar bulk by and the some of the energy studies that we 've done have all been a part of that and it just shows the innovation that the council group is a holes prepared to you know have a go out for the community and forever looking for cost-saving initiatives that wouldn 't help the bottom line for our rate payer in their dollar so you know this is great news Thank You thanks count split parts you should speak to the motion Council Buckley I have a sort of a semi questionable I know I 'm sorry counselor Buckley we 're in debate at the moment sorry what wearing debate at the moment said you wish to speak for or against the motion well I 'd just like to hear what he said I was busy fighting to write again because I was distracted and I didn 't quite hear what he said and it might have affected why perhaps I 'll give him a right of reply and he can cut dress up in thank you any further speakers councillor retainer and and I think if we go out with a solar bot by again I think we need to really really thin X round and I think we 'll see a different reaction from that group as well Thank You councillor Roberts do wish to the moment but I 'll try again what I was alluding to councillor Buckley was that climate changes is it 's largely agreed by the vast majority of the climate science community but it is not a natural phenomenon that work where we 're encountering at the moment it 's a largely human effected issue that we 're facing climate has changed in the past but it not to the scale or the impact that we 're seeing now so we can we can chat about it after the meeting mate if you want to but it 's not the forum to debate climate change but it 's something that 's very important and near and dear to me so thanks man thanks counselor rabbits oh I got the right No thank you I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion Gippsland Shire Council Grants Program funding round one 2019 2020 welcome Sacha and Katherine thank you madam mayor I 'm pleased to introduce you to Katherine McDonald who is our acting Community Programs Coordinator who 's going to speak to the report tonight this is a program that she 's invested considerable time and energy into in administering over the last three and a half years so thank you thanks for having me so tonight we 're coming to ask Council to adopt the recommendations we 've made on the community project grants and the arts and heritage grants it 's been a really good round with lots of varied applications we 've had 51 applications come in which is a large round the largest that I 've seen is 54 and we 've been able to recommend 25 of those applications we something to note we had a really strong round in the arts and heritage area and we have actually recommended the majority of that budget for the year in this round is approximately 15,000 dollars left for next round but the applications were so strong we felt we as I said we had a very really varied round of applications and supporting lots of new groups coming through as well which is good to see and we feel like this money is really going to support the community and and there 'll be some strong benefits as a result of this of this funding Thank You Katherine are there any questions from the counselors counselor retainer just a quick question what 's the general feedback from the people that are applying that 's about the process are they finding it easy they 're comfortable with is there anything we can do to make it easier or are they happy with how it is now and how it 's working the feedbacks been really good we 've we 've pretty much rewritten the guidelines and the application forms to simplify the process over the last year and a half we do community consultation before each round and have information sessions we had quite a few as part of the capacity building workshops right across the shy of his time really well attended and then we did some grand attended in Paynesville Lakes Entrance and and Ben 's now and the feedbacks been great and the applications have really improved as well so there was only one or two ineligible applications it 's round and usually there 's you know five or six so it 's good to see only further questions councillor Tino happy to move do we have the second no thanks counselor Ellis doosh to say a few words yeah I just think this is incredible what what the work we 're doing here the impact on our communities and in society and if you want to get down to the hard facts around economic development as well for every dollar we 've invested we 're getting over 3 50 return that 's a good investment in anyone 's book so I just come in the program and and thank you for making it the process easier for our community to access it as well and supporting the really important grassroots community thank you thanks councillor Tina counselor Ellis just a few words to acknowledge the good work in relation to the fact that we were you know that 's 50 percent of the applicants and also to recognize the diversity of the successful applicants and that 's really critical because they 're all community groups in their varying forms would be in the arts sports or just general recreation so it 's an important factor that the officers undertake to recognize diversity in awarding or recommending that these grants be awarded so I look forward to round two thank you ladies thanks counselor Ellis are there any further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you five point four point two economic development Advisory Board meeting of the 24th September 2019 welcome Stephen thank you madam mayor the purpose of this report is to see councils endorsement of several matters relating to councils own economic development advisory board at the recent meeting of the Advisory Board held on the 24th of September three items were presented to the board for consideration and recommendation to Council these were to funding applications to be funded from the economic development discretionary fund and the board also considered a sort of revised terms of reference that they 've reviewed at recent meetings with regard to the two applications the first one was for an application called float 2.0 the board considered the application and ingredient principle to funding the project pending amendments to the application including aspects such as locations partners funding contributions and other details that will aid transparency in the business case and with regard to the tourism training project the board recommended council approved the funding to this project for the amount of 6,000 pending amendments to the application which is presented to Council finally the draft terms of reference the board reviewed these at several recent meetings and recommended that council adopt the revised terms as presented to ensure the board remains relevant and provides a greater benefits benefits to council some of the changes included to the giraffe terms of reference include the length of tenure for board members to bring into line with the council election cycle minimum number of meetings per year clarifying membership of the board to ensure all industries are covered and clarifying the expectations of the board members thank on member there 's a couple of questions I have one ones on membership and when you have a 914 page agenda madam mayor sometimes you forget where you 've you 've seen something but I I 've seen I think I saw it in this document that the CEO was a member of the advisory committee that 's I could ask if that is correct before I asked a question is that correct yes the council house that 's correct perhaps I should direct this to the CEO because he 's status that is easier to appropriate for the CEO to be a member of this curve this particular committee noting that it 's an advisory committee to counsel when we should perhaps be looking for the CEO to maintain these independence as the administrative head of counsel it 's not a personal I think it 's an observation through you met Amir interestingly that 's not one of the items of the terms of reference that we altered from memory so that was an existing component of the the current terms if you like of membership so um I 'm happy to take it on notice and consider whether that is or counsel is able to make a amendment here and now good thank you for that I do appreciate that you know I 've just mentioned this now but I picked it up last night we never had a chance to discuss it today there is a number of other questions I have in relation to the matter there isn 't one methodology bring the council 's attention today and I think if we can just clear it here in this forum now is that the recommendations and presentations made to the Advisory Committee only that that is presentation of the committee and that the role of the committee is to provide advice to the council is that correct sorry yes counselor that 's correct right so that if you were to receive a presentation from a member of the community in relation to the future of the airfield that is all that is it 's just the presentation and he has no right to suggest to members of the other members of the community that facilities motor sports clubs they are under any threat this is a matter simply for the for advice to the committee yeah yeah that 's correct cancel while and Steven you 've said here that you will work with the float organization to strengthen application and look for other possible funding sources is it is it reasonable to ask how this may happen and what what may be the other funding sources so the question was about to them was about just clarifying which other funding sources they may have they did have some grants they were considering applying for so whether they were successful or they 're going to continue to apply for those grants there might be some other funding from the float organization itself so it was clarified the budget the the application form wasn 't fully completed in those areas so we 're just let seeking some clarification on that and some updates as well any further questions councillor pouts yes I 'm sitting here reading the attachments and under number 4.1 general business for discussion it says I 'm about a character by the name of briefing about proposal to build a motor purpose multi-purpose motor sports venue Alan explained that the proposal was originally muted with counsel some years ago however never moved beyond developing a business case funded partly by counsel the original proposal was to be developed on private owned land that eventually failed to go ahead the group has since not identified or acquired land this is a very very old idea which I believe the land they were talking about was the current women 's land that 's adjacent to the bean style tip property now Alan gave an overview of the proposal citing indicating costs and highlighting that the infrastructure proposed would incorporate field days educational driver training or current motor sport user groups currently located at the bends Dale Airport the cost to build such a venue is established at approximately 10 million dollars and requires some 50 hectares of land the group is asking for support from Council to move forward for from concept plan to making the proposal a reality the bottom line is we already have a committee of management of the land that they 're that they haven 't had any discussion or any for the further you know insight as to what that land might be and we have sent our office as a way to develop a Airport precinct plan and the Motorplex Sportsplex that we actually have had in our mind for many years now but the officers have not been able to come up with anything in regards to any type of development at all for them the users of that Motorplex and to see this on the table I think it 's quite confronting and it 's left off center and I hope they haven 't been encouraged in any way to believe that they actually have a right of ownership over the land it 's already there because they 've established good grounds in the way of supporting local learn to drive groups they 've got a great four-wheel drive Club out there they 've initiated very good very excellent initiatives in the way of motoring early years motoring and upskilling avenues for our community and driver safety programs the drag strip in every all those other uses out know an honest hugely in regards to the community and on the outer community of Melbourne we get visitors from Canberra Western Australia all over the nation to go and use that facility and then to see that in here is quite discouraging and I 'm sort of a bit sad to be thinking that miss Ellen Rumble might have some kind of a ownership right over what is already in place and I 'd hate to think that because someone 's come along and put this on the table that they would get pre sitting over what 's already established until 2031 in regards to our agreement with the current users Thank You councillor pals I 'll just clarify with regard to that the proposal that was discussed by Alan Rumble was not site-specific it was looking at a site independent to the airfield understanding that the future of the airfield and the future as a air services platform as well as the the site as a for other users and may have conflicts in the future so what they were looking at or what they wanted council to they asked us to go ahead the first thing we asked them to do was then go away and whether there is interest from those other stakeholders and to garner support so if there is if they come back and to us and say no interest then we 'll need to work out what what is dump or they 'll need to work out where to go to next if I may what has been offered to them you 've asked them to go away and sorry I 'm can you clarify what you 've asked them to go away and do yes sorry we haven 't there 's been nothing offered at this point we haven 't offered any any support other than to I guess acknowledge that there might be an opportunity for the region to have a an event precinct certainly acknowledging that the aerodrome site is not likely to be that location what may have conflict with sorry the aerodrome services where service is operating out of here councillor hours I 'm not sure whether I should address this to you do it all to you the float discussion in the sense that this afternoon I was told and other councils were told that council had was not having anything to do with the slipway development at Lakes Entrance and that that was being run by Dell but on rereading this here that reminded me here that the float application for forty six thousand dollars which is council money or a request for counsel in funding is involved in the the applique the the the manager or the building up of the slip by project and they 're talking about something that 's well well well well down the track by the look of it and I 'm wondering what role are we really having with the slipway development I 'm just concerned that I 've been given one picture that we have nothing it 's delp 's our responsibility after we had previously been the leaders in the last process and in here in this report it 's saying to us well we are part of of the funding of the slipway development project because the float people are going to be partnering with people comes a marketing channel are they well I think so but which is another subsidy no associative Council so can you please explain what the heck 's going on with the slipway sign Thank You counsel I 'll start with regard to this application and maybe hand over to Fiona with regard to the broader Dell process they 're going to hurry with regard to the slipway site so this that was this application was not specifically targeted it at the slipway site the full application looked at a number of different locations in East Gippsland so it could have been which this lip place like could have been one of that was one of the you know in the notes it 's recommended that locations is something that we were seeking more clarification and information on but it did discuss other locations such as my REM Elaine and some other public spaces around the region it wasn 't there was certainly some areas that we were seeking further clarification and that 's why the arm Advisory Board didn 't recommend it to Council for funding at this point about other course which would have come to you was this indicated contrary to what Envoy that we do have knowledge about a process that ProPlus process that 's coming to place for developments that won 't now I 'm very happy to see something being done with the place but contrary to what I 'm leader were saying we 're putting something at you know we 're casting the net out to see what projects can come in there it seems as if there is a whole series of things being put in place and that council some has good knowledge of this so I 'm just interested to see what 's going on because lakes is really looking out for its foreshore to be improved and enhanced but we don 't want anything too much have a little premature the process that is being run for the old side is an expression of interest places process which is currently open and it 's being run by job so it 's a job process as the crown and authority both gives them ports and so different parts of the organization not our price just I guess for public knowledge and inside the other council now can you explain Gibson ports to my knowledge are the committee of management I know there are you know under Delp in that sense I can why is it the dog have taken over and not gives the import and running this particular job they indicated that they have never seen anything what works was being there their core business and therefore because this will probably used by something other than function saying that it would probably hand back to dump once there is an appropriate use for the site so that is why he 's running it because while gifts and ports might be the committee of management just the underlying authority is still dump representing the crown so he 's really regardless who is a committee of management dope is still the crown Authority and responsible to that process so have run this process of the land and I guess looking to stimulate some uses for that site for Lakes Entrance and reinvigorate and activate that site which and not just to finish the lead the same logic was applied that you know it 's not give st. core business if st. ports core business to run anything other than port facility activity so therefore the council ran that thing on the on their behalf hoping that we would take it over or was it to revert to the crown we hadn 't made a decision about whether we took it over the for management plan certainly says when there 's a an appropriate use for that site that it might it 's appropriate for council to consider that that is something we would have to bring back to Council for consideration which we haven 't_''_8322.809 at this time but it was saying that it is a an area that wasn 't wasn 't given ports caught core business and we have an interest in trying to activate that site activate I 'm the foreshore in lakes entrance recognizing it 's council pouts yeah I 'm a little bit confused with this one counselor Ellis I 'd like some further explanation about funding application one the float air that keeps man Lakes ships is quite a decent slab of money out of our funding pool to be allocating to one well this is what I 'm this is what I 'm thinking so I 'm looking at it and I 'm going this project seeks to create a hero art and culture tourism destination for them oops man likes now the float setup is like a houseboat and it 's on Lake tires is that right Stephen can you just clarify again yes the flood is it 's a it 's a creative space I think it 's an art to space how to some resident space how does the resident space that 's what I was looking for I don 't think it is used as a house but I 'm not entirely sure but I don 't it 's a yeah it 's okay but yes we 're not moving artist-in-residence have a nice time and the recommendation is not to support it at this point it is not to support yes if you read the recommendation okay yes the economic development Advisory Board considered the proposal and considered that it a number of the things and give confidence around the outcomes so therefore it 's not ready to come to council for a decision for approval of funding and that is why the actual recommendations in from officers don 't refer to that one it only refers to the other proposal it 's intended that subject to sufficient information coming forward that demonstrates and gives confidence around the outcomes of the flight to proposal that it would be brought forward to Council for a decision at a later time but not at this meeting yes okay counselors another one which I 'd like like to see how to take don 't take away two reviewers and some membership and that was that we have the mayor and a counselor as member you know delegated members and that that 's good and that 's a pond but I 've been thinking about the position of mayor just because the person is the man not the individual and that is that you may have a mad it might be more concerned with say manmade climate change rather than economic development and that the workings of the committee and I 'm wondering whether we should be just terming it to councillors rather than mere and council this has got nothing to do would you bother my Mehta me but its origin o and and no you Jackson but I 'm just wondering whether that could be considered as well yeah I guess it can be considered as part of the discussion tonight I guess with these two points with regard to the CEO prior to making a recommendation need to be clarified right through you met Amir so I would guess well not guess I would ask then given that we 're asking council to adopt the revised economic development advisory board terms of reference are the things that are being raised then in relation to the membership actually amendments to that that could be dealt with tonight so it could have been that it 's the mayor the mayor or their delegate and one other councillor or is it two councillors and then the item about the CEO which as I say we didn 't change that and but if council the could that could certainly be changed as he always simply you know attends the meetings so our just in terms of process tonight we 've asked you to adopt them so we 're I guess seeking are they adopted or our other amendments being sought counselor at any general question like like any document it 's never going to be perfect but it 's a lot better than than last one nothing 's in concrete if you know it gets revised again for whatever reason it gets revised again but in relation to whether the mayor 's on on their it is only referring stuff back to the full council for decision making if we didn 't like what we were seeing as a full council we could not support it it 's there 's always safety mechanisms in everything we do it 's not at this decision-making it 's a referral committee look thanks for that and they 're valid points but I was more thinking all the input being being the chair of a couple of other committees we have caught vigorous input and and discussing like for to recommend the float application for forty six thousand dollars you know like I I see that if it 's not up to scratch we don 't need to see it here at this table and I appreciate that but that would have involved I assume some vigorous conversation and what-have-you on what my point was was that if you have someone that 's not particularly engaged where as compared to someone who is actually really engaged in a particular subject and it could apply to any of the other advisory committees then you want the best person on on on that particular advisory table so you I do accept what you say but this is the that 's this is the angle I was coming from and therefore often is not decisions are made that are reasonable and and work through more so than just a a prepared report coming on a quarterly basis so that 's the logic of my point so so we 've got a recommendation there do you wish to put an amendment to the recommendation cancer Ellis now look I 'll accept councillor Tino what you know the makeup of the board now it 's got nothing to do with the representation that we have it 's to do with that and I think I 'd like to take advantage of the CEOs offer to discuss the matter at a later time because this what this document can be brought back at a later time if it 's found to really justify the need I just see it 's important and as I said like words earlier that the CEO was not obligated to the committee or its decisions he needs to be independent as the senior executive of our organization and with the membership well I 've just explained that interns I 'm happy to unless somebody else wants to you know really change it I having been absent last week at the minister 's meeting did not get to see this document until it 's a bit late to come in and bring whole self changes like in terms of references they can be brought back at any time but now discretion say yeah so if there 's no further questions there councillor Roberts thanks second counselor II do wish to speak counsel Roberts I think it 's been thoroughly discussed and wholeheartedly hope that everybody supports the recommendation thanks counselor let 's councilor were you worst at anything any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thanks Stephen item six is urgent another business and there there being none I 'll ask that someone I 'll move that the council will now temporary closed the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 89 2d and hate of the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item 7.1 to 7.7 as these always relate to contractual matters and any other matter which the Council or special committee considers would prejudice the council or any person thanks counsel Alice put the motion to all those in favor council buckley yep motion is carried okay just _"

    "text": "okay welcome to today 's a waste session welcome to everyone here and on Facebook so the purpose of the presentation today is to help you the community understand what is included in the e waistband that commences on July 1 and why it 's important for all the community to act together to ensure that a waist doesn 't end up in landfill a quick introduction my name is J Mac I 'm a resident in sunny breathing and during the session if you have any questions I 'll endeavor to us answer them or defer to Karthik who is the East Gippsland Shire Council manager of waste and resource recovery for any technical questions so I 'm going to take you through a few points today and I 'm sorry my click is not working what is a waste so including what types of electronic waste are included in the landfill ban and what types of e-waste will remain free to dispose of after July 1 why it 's important for us to keep land waste out of landfill as a community where our waste goes once we bad for landfill so firstly obviously you 've heard seen or read given that you 're here that the Victorian Government is banning all a waste or electronic waste from landfill from July 1 this year and this includes our disposing of any type of electronic waste in your red leaded curbside bins from now until the end of June so you 've got about two weeks all a waste will be accepted for free in the e-waste disposal bins at pencil or bossed Bruin omiyo mallacoota and Lakes Entrance so there will be a user pays charge associated for most a waste items after July 1 and items will need to be taken to your nearest transfer station that accepts e-waste rather than in your red lead bin so firstly I 'll take you through what will before I go into more detail about what 's banned I 'll assure you that bulky items like white goods so fridges microwaves washing machine and dryers are still free to dispose of at transfer stations as they go in the metal pile not the electronic waste pile TVs and computers will well as now Lakes Entrance landfill as they are the nominated sites under the national television computer recycling scheme all small household batteries are now accepted for free at all a waste disposal sites and free disposal of fluorescent tubes and complex compact fluorescent lights which has up to now only been available at burns thou has now been extended to all the e-waste sites which includes all bust proven omiyo mallacoota and lakes so what is a waste so electronic waste includes all end-of-life electronics and electrical items with a plug a battery or a cord any electronic component within an item so anything that 's no longer wanted or working including TVs and computers big things like air conditioners and small things like hair dryers and irons toys with batteries vacuum cleaners power tools so I when I started this project went around my house and had a look at all the e-waste we have in our house which I 'm going to clean out this weekend and found we 've got old landline phones old tap timers a lot of my kids toys have electronic components and electronic components in them so commonly wastes found around the home includes in the kitchen we have items such as obviously your fridge and in some cases your washing machine dry as microwaves irons toasters kettles and coffee machines and I 've got an old blender I 've got to get you rid of I 'm in the bathroom we have electronic toothbrushes electric razors hair dries straighteners in the study and laundry and we 've got obviously TVs computers screens keyboards printers batteries gaming consoles heaters mobile phones phone chargers come under a waist as well and all other cords such as headphones so anything with any type of wire or cord in it so in the garage and shed which we were talking about earlier we 've got all our power tools and electric lawn mowers and whipper snippers and it 's believed that one in five Australians are hoarding their electronic waste so if you are you better get a clean out this weekend and get it to the landfill sites before July 1 so some other facts about a waste it waste is the fastest growing faster than other municipal waste because of our increased reliance on technology the reduced product lifespan and consumer demand for new products so anyways contains valuable materials that we can recover and reuse endlessly as well as hazardous materials that can harm human and the environment and for the Shire for us here recycling is expensive and waste management is expensive so it cost the Shire hundred and fifty dollars per cubic meter for any type of material that goes to landfill then an additional 85 per ton to send our recyclables to Melbourne so the Shire pays between 1 and 1.2 million dollars per year just in the levy that we pay the victorian government so it 's our second highest expenditure within the shire so in a we can do to reduce landfill means we can save money and spend the money on more meaningful community projects in skips land Shire are innovators when it comes to waste management and you a storage and collection we have now at each of the e-waste sites and a waste bin that was designed and developed just for the Shire and any of the a waste science so currently more than 1 million mobile phones and 1.5 million TVs are discarded in Australia every year and more than 17 million TVs have been discarded since 2008 so it 's estimated that just four TVs and computers the amount of waste generated in Australia will increase by 60% by 2024 so this in the next five years it 's a huge amount so considering that could go into landfill or it could be recycled up to 90 percent of your phone TV and computer can be recycled so we really need to be mindful of how we 're managing our erased as individuals and the total value of the raw materials in global air waste per years eighty billion dollars so there are other reasons to recycle e-waste in Victoria as I said it 's estimated that a hundred and nine thousand tons of e-waste were generated in 2015 and by 2035 this will increase to two hundred and fifty-six_,_501.93 thousand tonnes so it 's important to reduce the amount of waste we sent to landfill for the sheer volume of the to landfill there are other key reasons to recycle our waste it 's better for the environment a waste contains hazardous materials that can range from heavy metals such as lead and Mercury and ozone depleting CFCs and even flame retardants so in small these dangerous chemicals can cause environmental contamination however when millions of any waste items get into landfill or our student or stored inappropriately obviously the situation becomes much more serious they can leach dangerous chemicals into our groundwater soil and air and as these substances don 't break down easily they can cause long-term environmental impacts and a waste contains valuable materials which are non-renewable in most cases yet easily recovered and recycled so electronic items often contain precious medals including tin copper nickel silver zinc gold aluminium and platinum so while each individual object doesn 't contain very much of these precious metals this can quickly add up when you consider the sheer number of items that are discarded each year and now you can 't extract those metals yourself you need to have special equipment but in the 1 million mobile phones that are yield up to 16 tons of copper which is non-renewable 350 kilos of silver and 34 kilos of gold and it 's also important because as I said precious metals are non-renewable and once they 're gone they 're gone for good but if we recycle them and recover them properly they can be reused endlessly and by reusing what we 've already mined we 're not only cutting costs we 're also creating jobs in the recycling sector and reducing the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by the mining processing and transportation of these raw materials so how do you recycle your waste so as I said up until from now until the end of June you can drop your waste off for free any a waste item off for free at one of the e-waste designated you a site so these are the addresses for burns Dale or bust Reuven Oh mio mallacoota and lakes so it 's that simple from your perspective you 've just got to get going over the weekend and make sure you get into action in the next two weeks so where 'm one of those people that yeah you know put something in the bin and then it 's gone one of the interesting things I 've learnt is that while researching this project is where where our waste goes and how it can be used I didn 't know that many of the heavy metals could be reused and reused pretty much endlessly so in the first instance obviously it 's stored drop off and then it 's transferred to an a waste processing facility would you like I can tell you about the process if you 're interested yeah okay sure so in the first instance it goes for disassembly so depending on the type of device this can occur manually in the first instance so the steel cases are taken off PC boxes batteries and casings are removed from phones and things like cartridges and toners are taken off printers and the glass and from TVs and monitors especially the old-style CRTs have to be very carefully removed as they contain let the next case the next stage is shredding so basically the remaining items and components are material is often a manual process which is interesting but there are some automatic processes that occur magnets are obviously used to remove metal eddy currents are used to remove non-ferrous metals such as aluminium and other things like infrared beams lasers and x-rays or bursts of air are used to identify various plastics and other metals water is used to separate plastics from glass and then any contaminants are treated and removed and then the raw materials are then repurposed so once the war materials are sorted in turn everyone were to sorted into their raw form they can be resold to suppliers to make new products so up to 90% of e-waste can be recycled as I said and the goal is to make a closed loop where a new product isn 't made from raw virgin materials anymore but instead from fully recycled materials which in turn are also fully recyclable and once all the different components of your Airways are back in the supply chain they can be reused to make many many things so plastics are now being turned into plastic fence posts pallets casings batteries which i think is cool precious metals obviously used to make jewelry and your electronics and glasses news to make TVs and monitors again and home wares and other metals are turned into cabling which we have a lot of here so how to avoid creating a waste in the first place it 's possibly the most important point because while it 's important to recycle your waste it 's even more important to reduce the amount you create in the first place so basically you can have a look at the product you want to buy and make sure it 's right for your needs it 's going to meet all your needs you 're not going to be disposing of it in the short term try and choose a brand that 's environmentally responsible and only upgrade your tech if you need to and see if there 's businesses around that environmentally conscious and working to say solve the e-waste problem there are also things you can do to divert or delay your items going into e-waste if you have something that you no longer need or offer it to friends or family if they want it sell out and buy swap and sell you can give it to the op shop if they will take electronic waste I know breathin won 't_''_924.23 but some will or you can sell it that makes money to buy some new electronic things I 'm joking so between now and the end of June these are the places you can recycle your waste for free after that as I said white goods will remain free TVs and PCs will remain free at lakes and burn cell and batteries and fluorescent tubes will now be accepted at all sites so before you send your items off for recycling we recommend that with your TV and your with your phone and your computer you make sure that you get rid of any personal data that is on there there 's more information about getting rid of your data off your phone or your computer on either these sites and that concludes the presentation for today so if you have any further questions Karthik is on hand for technical would you like to have any further questions obviously contact the Shire [Applause] but at this stage we have no plans of setting up any drop of air points within the town proceed it 's only going to be in the waste facility at this stage but that 's something we could definitely look into nice opening Thompson 's give me time ago this book where it was last on this very minute LD you know computer screen I like free after July it 's been stare in lakes well they 're not got a question on your budget you 've got computer screen twenty four dollars or twenty five dollars it 's not it 's not at this question and clarify so there was the national television and computer recycling scheme that was introduced a few years ago by the federal government and Bailey is the designated site and under that scheme we are able to take television computers and CPUs at no cost and that will still continue and this feed fees and charges for computer CPUs that 's meant that 's been presented as part of the budget has always been not under the scheme and like say that because it 's his greenways free and these virtual sites that you deliver take greenways and you get charts so it 's not consistent we can fix that on the web scientist thank you and and that this C television CPUs and that 's going to be yeah there 's a there 's a hazardous waste mentioned for thirty bucks that is the analog TV we are talking about the box which is called CRT it 's got a substantial amount of lead and at this stage there is only one company in South Australia that deals with that late and the CRT television so that 's the reason why my husband now we worked out the tonnage costs and the logistics so worked out at this stage it 's a lot of things are unknown basically how much of material is going to come in how much are we going to cut and maybe this the fees and charges will be review on an annual basis depending on the influx of material that comes in and also depending on the cost does everybody have to go to forge great Forge Creek yeah at this stage we haven 't_''_1426.94 we 've only had these designated sites but as in when we look at things and it 's a fairly new concept and a new system that 's been introduced and it 's been in force disband so there 's a lot of unknowns at this stage so we will be looking at you know different options and the logistics of things interviewing where the collections point collection points would be over the years over the coming months depending on how much you 're thinking wait now we are going by size by weight by the size we don 't have the discretion it 's a warning but the contract the contractor charges us on tonnage well if the state government gives us that image we will be more than happy to pass it on to the only at this stage we don 't have any kind of concession for this change god technical P double y that is that was cross-border from New South Wales that 's more to do with municipal facilities in Danny North in Melbourne a waste and we are fortunate to have that in this sort of Melbourne so all our waste goes to the three facilities so we have a tender out at this stage so we will probably have you we have we will have a contractor from 1st of July who will be involved in taking a processing anything else benefits it 's basically cost no incentive so I can 't see it just like recyclables not going to be unless you won 't have a police state that 's the only way that 's great and it doesn 't happen here in Dane style at all and CV days yes it 's a catch-22 and it 's going to be a hard one to tackle in terms of we do have a band of you know the e-waste not going to landfill but it 's going to be very hard for us to police the red little beads unless we go out and check every LED red limping and the recipes through education you put your cameras on don 't you on the resort actually check Amontillado check the small potentially could at some one way we could have a look at what we do once we have waste education officer I know the commando from the sustainability team has been working very hard with schools and community everybody who 's worth this work who works at my team the landfill has been educating the community as and when they come by in whether it 's mattress or electronic waste or any other ways so we are trying a little best to do and educate and create more awareness so it will be ongoing it will be an ongoing effort because absolutely but the rollout of this whole program there 's also office words that 's just got budget from the same to a gradient structure so all the office works so we 'll have a waste disposal facility in the future so that 's coming up I 'm sure there are other stores in agencies working on the same you know kind of platform to provide better services and we will be doing that in the future as well and we do have information on where you can Resort where is your closest recycling facility for different sort of commodities so I will keep that updating as well as and when we get an opportunity and we find new places but at this stage we are looking at peace for locations as far as Council facilities are concerned long term with the caps we 'll be looking at doing some processing it sure harvesting the e-waste or a lot of requirements conditions EPA requirements so it 's a long process to get in and then also the occupational health and safety sort of things so it 's a quite even though it looks as a simple commodity it is the dismantling of the product we do have there enough money you need to do it there could be a potential but again a business game that we need to look at what for example we have been working with the tip shop there for mattress dismantling so all the mattress that goes to the base is actually stripped and the metals are separated and we 're doing that for polystyrene we are looking that processes polystyrene so they will definitely be an ongoing you know research and exploring of different ways of how we could do and process in-house because that would reduce the logistic and we are definitely looking at an exploring opportunities to work with the community organizations in the long run to tackle these in process the mean house and any opportunity we 'll be more than happy to alright great well no one has any questions nothing that concludes our session today thank you for coming thank you _"

interest in not understanding where our waste is going and how we are many twice it 's a really important part of what council does and it 's a really our recycling goes we 've got quite a complex process but between 60 and 65 percent of our recycling goes from the yellow bins that the curbside collection bins and the other recycling just distribution points to a local sorting operation that 's operated by Tambo waste that separates into glass and paper and then it 's all sent to Melbourne where it 's recycled and reused so that from there the glass is crushed and reused the paper is recycled and a lot of the soft plastics and aluminium are reused in terms of them how much of our waste is recycled as we said there 's about sixty to sixty-five percent However about ninety-five percent of our waste could be recycled so these kits are whilst we 're doing really well could do better still so that means that some people are popping their recyclables into their red bins rather than their yellow bins and that 's not giving the opportunity so we 've still got about 30% of the land of our potential recyclables going into landfill so I guess there 's a message in that for that we 're reducing landfill and making sure that everything that we can possibly be reuse is reuse I 'd like to direct town kay to a great YouTube video that actually shows what happens to our recycling when we when we send it to Melbourne we send it to a busy busy recycling and so if you just google that and look at the YouTube it shows how it 's per the recycled and down on youth and all the great uses that our recycling goes to thank you thanks miss waggle item 1.9 is record of assemblies of counselors for July and September 2019 thanks counselor Pelt 's thanks counselor Ellis all those in favor motion is carried item 2 is notices of motion or rescission item 2.1 councillor Reeves thanks man thank you ladies and gentlemen I 'd like to note that it 's my intention tonight to move at this ordinary council meeting 10th of September that East Gippsland Shire Council request the Victorian Government to support a target for local regional representation on statutory boards advisory councils trusts or specific commissioners entities may include but services catchment management authorities thoughts coordinating boards specific natural resource authorities for example lakes coordinating committees waste management authorities economic development authorities education providers such as TAFE and others as required and that may emerge from time to time ladies and gentlemen such boards have been established by the Victorian Government to undertake a range of administrative service delivery and or regulatory functions with the aim of ensuring communities thrive while school specific appointments are essential so our governance specific skills and local representation the intention of this notice of motion is set to as an aspiration for representation on boards by suitably qualified people who reside in and have specific knowledge of the local area affected by the appointed board so I move that East Gippsland cashie a council will write to the premier so you can consideration to the Victorian government to enact our request by introducing local local representative quotas or targets as has been achieved by gender representation on boards so you support from local state government for a strategic approach to skills development for local potential board members for example local board director courses and and local government network councillors I hope you 'll support this notice of motion thanks counts the raves do I have a seconder thanks councillors councillor Reeves you wish to speak further to you thank you I will speak to the motion very quickly as is written statutory boards advisory councils trusts or specific commissioners perform essential and valued roles and ensure the continual thrival of our communities whether it 's a local medical service water or sewage supplies to homes economic development groups all make our communities better places to live grow and invest such entities should have representatives who bring skills of good governance financial management compliance and strategic planning there is a risk that such entities attract membership that could meet these skills but do not necessarily reside in the locale of the entity ideally membership would have appropriate representation gender ability disability indigeneity and location or postcode residents among others unfortunately such aspirations do not always result in real-world experience that matches the expectation so the purpose of this notice of motion ladies and gentlemen is to ensure that representation on regional and in particular Gippsland commissioners include representation from local areas we will write we will advocate with the Gippsland Local Government network in writing to the premier as per the notice of motion and follow with interest the outcomes of the decision moreover we will forward look forward to understanding a review in future of local membership models to ensure that the best outcomes and decisions result thank you for your indulgence councillors and ladies and gentlemen thanks council arrays council I was due wish to speak taking to account the degree of covering things that councillor Reeves has provided us this evening this little to add just to reinforce support for his motion and to emphasize that this is a Gippsland wide vision for the betterment of our peoples in the the great region of Gibbs land Victoria and that this concern is not based on pure protocol ISM but simply on the betterment of the provision of services to the wider community by providing experience gained from being a regional person I commend the recommendation to Council thanks counselor Ellis so there any further speakers put the motion to you all those to see you through you madam mayor there is no different business tonight thank you item 4 counselor reports counselor 2e_._734.65 thank you mad at me I have sent him my report which outlines a number of things that I did during the last month the one thing that I would like to bring up is a is a mediation session that I attended with counselor Ellis who ran the mediation session I was in in regards to a planning permit issued in it like tires and just from my point of view sitting down talking to people and having a group of people in a room discussing what the issues were and the the excellent outcome that we had from from that meeting in regards to what what the proponent could do to to address some of the issues that the local people had and and what some of the misunderstandings were that some of the objectors had in regards to what what this person wanted to do just in regards to building a house so it was an excellent meeting to attend and it shows what we can and respectful manner it was it was a great meeting to be part of thank you thanks counselor to you counselor thanks very good evening and thank you and welcome everyone especially a large gallery tonight I presume from Raymond island and Newlands arm so great to see you all here and we welcome you it 's always good for us as a council to have members of the community it adds a bit of gaddafi to our operation here ladies and gentlemen I was with in particular last weekend with a cohort from the Gippsland Community Leadership Program in Marlo and good mayor he 's an alumnus of that particular program as is councilor Pelt 's I believe a bit further ago so six skips land councils and many other statutory authorities and organizations support this program they were on their way up to Canberra and in this year it 's the biggest cohort some 27 to 3 of whom are women which is just fantastic however the little downside of this that I wish to point out and I just say well done those leaders but unfortunately opportunities social indicators in this country and in our region tend to be postcode dependent it would go without wouldn 't go without me saying NAPLAN data for example corresponds directly to an indicator called Ixia which is an indicator of social education and occupational advantage or disadvantage and despite these challenges though I do want to point out that the NAPLAN data for our local schools are worthy of congratulations and recognition they have done an amazing job and I do urge you to go into the my school 's website and compare the local data to like schools australia-wide and why do I say that is because Community Learning leadership programs like GC LP thrive on upcoming young leaders from our schools who get their education locally and our schools in our show deliver amazing outcomes very remotely from mallacoota way up into the mountains and I congratulate them what 's this got to do with our council our council job is to make sure our wraparound services are there to contribute to those young people 's success so they can aspire one day to be the alumnus of those management boards or committees of management that will help our Shire thrive thank you ladies and gentlemen thanks Council arrays counselor Robert thank you madam mayor we 've got a small confession to make I was away this weekend so when I was going through the 1145 page agenda for this evening 's meeting I wasn 't able to put anything together so thank you madam mayor Councillor Roberts councillor Buckley yeah I think I can beat that one madam me I went to the opening of the fishing season and benamber the barbecue and there was only a few little fish caught and most of had to be thrown back so thank you my thanks counselor Buckley counselor Ellis thank you madam mayor I 'd like to welcome everyone here this evening as you have and I 'm pleased to report to Council and I 've a continuing busy past month the month of August I 'll just run through noting that we 've got such a busy night a couple of the issues that I 've met and tended to which included workshops in relation to waste program the circular economy discussions at Tyrell gong and wider discussions on digital communication at War Eagle my present by written report to Council finally madam meth on the weekend I had the honor to represent Council at the 90th year celebration of the Lakes Entrance Irvin volunteer fire brigade the night celebrated the commitment and sacrifice of the brigade volunteers over those years one of the highlights of the event was the preparation of a book highlighting the ninety years of the brigade service and I most please to be able to present a copy of that booklet to you man I met Emir on behalf of Council thanks counselor Ellis council a while thank you madam mayor there was a number of events that I attended but I 'll condense them down to a few that I think a worthy of of discussion here tonight one of them being part of my pet subjects and emergency management was that that meeting local meeting was held this month and it 's interesting to note that we are now facing a third dry season and the the records have shown of more than one full year of rainfall so it describes how dry it 's been but on a positive note as with the aid of some of the federal government funding we 've been able to increase the number of large storage tanks for fire trucks to fill up in the in the remote areas so that 's that 's a bonus considering that many of the dams are dry so at least we will have some water in a strategic position if there is an outbreak the the forestry alcohol the Forestry gave us a report that during the year that been now 260 outbreaks in the in the scrub of which 97% of them were defended and kept to less than five hectares so that was a great result in other words we did not have wildfires everywhere through the summer but of the other 3% the timber road fire of earlier this year actually burn 22,000 hectares so it 's a it 's a yep there 's just another reminder that if we do get another hot summer how difficult it will be to control some many of you know is that the announcements been made that the fire restrictions will come in in East Gippsland the week and after this so within a short two weeks we 'll add fire restrictions you know an event that I 've found extremely rewarding to go to was an invitation from Karen Fleischer who was the president of the Ben style Chamber of Commerce and she I believe meeting her and speaking to those who were invited or wish to attend she is lifting the profile and I believe doing a great job for the local businesses here and she she had a guest speaker Robin Hales who 's the CEO at the Ben style Hospital and very engaging talk that she gave us yeah she 's very qualified capable woman and I wish her all the best in the job that she has at hand and then just recently on Sunday an event that was sponsored by the East Gippsland Shire through through some of the drought funding was a barbecue to try and bring the people of hillside just a local community out to the west you know as it 's really difficult when you are semi remote there are not too many people that you can just lean over the fence to talk to so to bring these people together they had a good day was well attended and and I might add they they wanted me to pass on their thanks to the show for that contribution thank you thanks counselor white councillor pelts thank you madam me I just had one thing that I wanted to say that I was delighted about was being commissioned to sit on the rural councils committee so I 'll be stunning that on Friday and I look forward to being able to represent our community on the state level with regards to rural councils it represents 48 councils out of the 78 councils in the state and specifically dealing with rural issues and the drought stuff will also be another target we 'll be addressing as well it 's something that we have in common with a lot of the regions so Toulouse something that 'll be one of the hot topics but I look forward to thank you thanks Council pouts council retainer is absent but he has fought it on his report and asked me to read out one of the things that he had done during the last month which was attending the Clontarf academy benz dale alongside myself and it 's the director Paul Carroll and his assistant boss fortune the local Academy mentors so they run a training session each Friday and they really do a sensational job with the local community and achieve a great deal for the aboriginal community and it basically keeps boys in the education system and keeps them engaged so they do a wonderful job and I just wanted to note that I attended the 2019 Federation Business School gives them business awards on behalf of the council we sponsor the food wine producers category which we had to local entrants in Gippsland Jersey and Lightfoot wines but Harmon wines were worthy winners but we also have local businesses shade works who won the manufacturing export award and East Gippsland osteopath clinic which originated out of all bust won the health and wellbeing award and probably the 's trailers were inducted into the Hall of Fame and they 're only the second East Gippsland business behind parties to be inducted into the Hall of Fame so that was a great achievement for them I 'll leave it at that okay moving on to the officer reports I don 't better Mary if I may with the amount of people that are here this evening I 'd like to bring forward the emotions that are relevant to them and there will be five point three point four be the application for the planning permit and development of land for group accommodation and native vegetation removal at 27 to 31 reveille gravelly Point Road Raymond island that would be the first one and the second one will be the planning application five point three point five five Penrose plays Dylan 's monkey lot subdivision in that particular order so if we could bring them forward so that the crowd can you know second that thank you put that to you all those in favor next motion is carried so we 'll bring those reports forward sorry item five point p application for use and development of land for group accommodation alterations and additions to a divine creation of a carriageway easement and that native vegetation removal at 27 and 31 gravelly Point Road roaming island welcome mister hallo thank you madam mayor Thank You counselors as you 've heard this is an application for Houston development of the land for group accommodation at 31 gravely Point Road Raymond island counselors you be aware that we 've had a planning consultation meeting and respect to this application where there was a large turnout at the railing raymond island community hall and a whole range of matters where raised by residents related concerns they have with this proposal counselors this proposal in short is on a property on two parcels of land approximately 2.6 4 hectares in size the land is 27 and 31 gravity Point Road it 's zoned rural living zone is included with their bushfire Management overlay design development over like significant landscape overlay and vegetation projection over like the proposed use and development includes extending the existing dwelling use of and continuation of the development of the one additional building with two units is proposed development of swimming pool and associated with a group of combination use vegetation removal to establish new site access and to formalize vegetation removal which occurred in the past to establish the five units creation of courage courage way over 31 gravely PI Road to provide formal access driveway access and vehicle access to the site counselors as I said this application has attracted a significant attention of the local community with a you know objections being lodged I can advise counselors as you would be aware because I know the general major placing community provided a recent objection that came in on Monday and there was an additional some submissions from current objectives the additional objection raised matters of traffic and amenity they have been covered in this report and have been considered counselors you will be aware that this application hasn 't been straightforward it has resulted from enforcement action having to be taken against the landowner and as as always as part of the Victorian planning process where there is an opportunity for someone to make application and potentially should be provided to the landowner Council my council officer has done an excellent job in working through some significant challenges with this application and has provided a detailed report for councils review I 'm not intended to go through that report in blow-by-blow status but I would like to take you to some relevant conditions I don 't take it tend to take you through all the conditions of the permit but obviously officers are recommending the notice of decision to grant a permit be issued councillors I 'll take you to the most relevant conditions if I may condition one is to get a set of further plans to be provided to council to ensure that the endorse plans will address what has been sought there is also a requirement in condition 2 for in association with the swimming pool and that 's to make sure that we 're not just meeting planning requirements but also the building requirements will be met councillors you will note that there is a requirement to undertake all the activities here in accordance with the cultural heritage management plan councils will recall raised and it was clarified at that meeting that only use and development of this land for group accommodation is being sought not a caravan park caravan park has been shown on the cultural heritage management plan the reason for that is that the permit applicant who may have some future considerations of this site didn 't want to do a second cultural heritage management plan and that 's understandable because they are expensive pieces of work to have done once again this application doesn 't seek a caravan and camping park castle the conditions six there is a requirement for drainage infrastructure to be provided dweller all the dwellings have to be and the group accommodation dwellings have to be connected to stormwater runoff councillors at 8 and 9 there are conditions about the need for formal vehicle crossovers to be developed and this goes to some of the concerns of objectives with respect to traffic and I can say as I through those conditions our engineers have reviewed this proposal and they do not believe that this will cause significant traffic volumes within the local road network and capacity to deal with these additional traffic movements a condition 10 you can see that there is a need to provide for services and the like I 'd like to take you to condition 15 if I could councilors because this is a requirement for landscaping to be undertaken on the side and you will note that in the last dot point there is a requirement for revegetation to take place for a proposed minimum of two thousand square meters of land now that 's been as a result of some negotiations of my officer with the permit applicant to advise them that there is a need to make good on what they 've done which has not been a great thing and that 's been removal vegetation without the approvals counselors we believe that that provides a good outcome for biodiversity within raymond island councils you will notice that it conditions 17 18 19 and 20 there is requirements for offset planting and 21 for evidence of that to be provided to council for the removal of the vegetation associated with the access ways at 22 there was concerns permanent abode and we 've got a requirement here that that restricts the ability for those units to be used for that purpose you will also note that a 24 there is a requirement for management a management plan and a guest log to be maintained so the council can ensure through normal enforcement processes that that is being adhered to that requirement you also know that 25 that there 's a requirement for an emergency response plan to address wildfire bushfire and land inundation and x2 raymond island and we 've tied up a lot of these requirements at condition 26 with a legal agreement counselors i will point to conditions 28 29 and 30 they are conditions to address the country fire authorities mentally referral and that 's to make sure there 's this primacy of life and property in event of a bush in times of a bushfire event happy to take questions council thanks mister hollow questions counselors cancel the robots thank you madam mayor i guess one of my major concerns around the applicants are around the applicants ability to provide to properly complete the from 2007 permit expires permit conditions and works that occurred without a valid planning permit how does this affect the plan in consideration and how can we assure the local community the program proponent will be will comply to the requirements Thank You counselor I ensured I 'm not in control of a third party I can 't tell you that they will comply we do have enforcement abilities to be undertaken and at the end of the day and I believe to a lot of planners discomfort is that unfortunately we can 't_''_2078.36 force people to complete development but I think that 's the best answer I can give you at this time counselor counselor Pelt 's if I may can you just make a clarification for me of a couple of things with this application they 're proposing to are they proposing to do the 4th two-bedroom unit on this proposal because there 's only three standing there now so the idea is to finish the three off and add the additional one that was in the original plans correct the pool was also in the original plans to safety standards that 's what 's proposed and we 've got conditions down there too sure it spins properly and the other thing that I wanted to ask was I 'm the first dot point states that that they were going to build a shed so there 'll be an additional shed on is it on the site where the actual three units are now or is it over the fence where the original house dwelling was built here it 's associated with the dwelling Council so with that stated the people that own the three units now are they the people that own the place over the fence with that are putting up the up yes there 's a there 's one landowner for the two parcels of land any further questions counselor 2e thanks Aaron in your opinion have the changes that have been made to this permit application have they addressed the issues that have been brought up from from a planning perspective from a planning perspective I believe the requirements that my office has been able to negotiate and the changes that the applicant has when we 're balancing the planning scheme that this is an appropriate outcome and one that 's worthy of support can slip out yes Aaron can I just um can you entertain me with what 's going to occur here with regards to the township boundary because in the initial in my initial thoughts I think it was discussed that the actual development of the units was outside the Raymond Island Township boundary and if he can explain the complications with that so councilor the township boundary was put in to put in place on time ago when this application was first approved back in 2006 2007 there was no chance you 've boundary at that time by my recollection but indeed there is no requirement no need to change the town boundary in this particular case it is an allowable use on rural living zone land so we have no intention to increase a Township boundary cancel the Roberts thanks again madam mayor how does the application conform with councils plan a livable region goal one and two well counselor we suggest that if we 're going to have have to obviously make sure that we allow for not just our own population but to encourage and support our visitor sector and visitors and also to include that we 've got support for our economic development of our townships so we feel that that 's a good outcome we also believe that once again say congratulations to my officer for being able to negotiate a revegetation of this very denuded site in my opinion and I think that 's that 's a very good outcome and that 's why we 're achieving their vision councillor pouts mr. Halloween regards to the many many letters that we 've received and then everyone I thank you all for writing in and ringing us up and expressing your concerns in regard to this application a lot of it was you know it had compassion and passionate means behind it and they were stating things like um you know that it would be overcrowding people will be you know there 'll be many car more car movements very movements etc etc the rationale behind what they 've actually written in and said do actually a means for this to be consideration this to be considered in the application counselor my opinion I believe we have undoubtedly there 's a lot of passion that was expressed both through objections and in the planning authority of meaning we are aware that the residents in Raymond Island are very proud of and rightfully of the landscape settings did they live within and the fact that they live on a very beautiful island in our opinion the eighth accommodation units accommodating a small number of people will not cause an adverse energy impact on the island our engineers have had a look at traffic volumes and what are the street networks can are capable of handling and that will not cause an overwhelming of those roads and we believe that the number of vehicle movements wouldn 't put overly adverse burden on the theory as well so I think we have covered those matters in our consideration of this application counselor Ellis I think you made a make mr. hallow taking to account the precedent that have occurred in relation to this planning application and the actions of time can you tell Council how Council itself can police or ensure that the conditions as part of your recommendation to Council could be policed or supervised to ensure that any applicant would comply with those conditions so council we will have a fairly proactive stance on this particular site not just because of the history but also there is a requirement for a number of officers of council to be signing off on approvals for instance vehicle crossing approvals vegetation removal Bri vegetation stormwater development and the like so we will have regular officers out there having a look at this site and we 'll be able to bring to the attention any any breach of any conditions or maybe matters that aren 't in accordance with endorsed plans or the life now would that action be in the in the short term or into the longer term to ensure compliance going into the future that would be both in the short term so as soon as the permit applicant started getting a building permit and taking advantage of the permit and in the longer term as well we 've even got legal agreements in place that the applicant would have to enter into that we would have to make sure of cambria compliance with any further questions councillor Roberts thanks again madam mayor Erin what would eat what would what would occur if council was not to approve the recommendation so counselor if cancelled determined to move a motion of refusal the matter could be appealed by the permit applicant and indeed we if it was appealed we would see through that appeal and we would support council council 's position of refusal and see what VCAT determined was the outcome if he can 't determined to refuse the application then council would be in a position of having to take enforcement action and that would mean during an enforcement order to VK and see what we can would would feel about that enforcement order I understand in the application there was a number of regulations changed around apologize for getting the terminology incorrect with overlays and consideration of neighborhood character and things like that changed so it was it was said that the initial built out to be constructed most likely wouldn 't have been improved now is there any is there any precedence at V cap for any similar cases that might have been considered because quite a peculiar way councillor that 's a bit tricky because I haven 't had a look at precedent for a little bit of time but what I can certainly say is that on occasions where a planning scheme amendment might change the planning scheme and there 's an overlay control or a different policies enacted that that can often require an application to be amended to address those requirements in this case we 're in a bit of an unfortunate situation where we 've had a number of controls change over a number of years and we 're trying to balance now some quote competing controls and one of those series competing controls is obviously the bushfire management over I which would manage to achieve before I forget one of the one of the previous applications is actually refused forget the year can you please remind me what that was on the bounds off I believe counselor that and at that time the bush fire management overlay had been amended and incorporated the property the previous application and women cysts wasn 't considered against the bush fire management overlay therefore we said it 's not appropriate to extend the life of that permit what were changed counselor what change was the mapping the bushfire mapping overlay came over the property where it wasn 't_''_2785.54 in the past counselor tui Thank You Erin you you mentioned before about the conditions that have been negotiated with the with the proponent I 'm just wondering what would what would potentially happen there if if carrots are were of the mind to refuse the application tonight that I 'm assuming then allows the proponent to appeal to vcap correct and secondly what then would potentially happen to all those conditions would they potentially be lost if the cat were to overturn our decision they potentially could so the conditions that that you 've managed to negotiate would potentially be lost and and they 're a lot of those conditions along the lines of what the objectors were objecting to so my point development that is less in line with what locals were asking for and that 's a question so counselor just just to make it clear officer is negotiated changes to the plans and requirements about landscaping in the line we haven 't necessarily negotiated it out the detail of the conditions but going to your point yes if we went to VK VK would then determine what conditions are placed on a planning permit if they were going to issue one and there may not be these type of conditions placed on that planning permit any further questions councils okay there 's a motion before you councillors do I have a mover madam mayor I 'd like to move the alternative motion is there a seconder for the alternative thanks counselor Ellis councillor roberts do you wish to speak to alternate information I don 't think there 's anything else to be said from I 've asked a lot of questions of Aaron as the other fellow councillors but I 'd like to move the the alternative motion as it is written there Thank You counsel alice jewish to add made very clear to council and members of the public in the gallery they can see what we 're proposing here that 's we could go back so we can all understand that what councillor Robertson are suggesting that the pro the project be not approved and perhaps I 'm I 'm not sure on prices here and look at the government 's officer Mehta mid for advice where we would be required to read the main part of this new motion out thirdly I 'm not sure in some cases we are required to do it I mean others we 're not so can I seek some advice please mr. CEO through you madam mayor it certainly wouldn 't hurt to do so that way it is clear and everyone can be absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt of what is actually being moved councillor Roberts do you wish to read it first plan can I just ask whether or not he needs to go through all parts or the principal parts one pitch to part one rather than the entire life I move that counsel being the it determines the planning permit application to to 20 18 p is inconsistent with the requirements and objectives of the East Gippsland planning scheme have met the SK plan planning scheme and therefore resolves to issue a notice of refusal to create a permit for use and development of the land for group accommodation alterations and additions additions to a dwelling creation of a carriageway easement and the native vegetation removal at 27 and 31 gravelly Point Road Raymond Island subject to the following grounds a proposed use and and development is inconsistent with the planning policy framework and local planning policy and the local and the rural living living zone purposes B the proposed use and development will represent an unacceptable hazard to life and property from bushfire threat and in times of inundation of Raymond Island C at the proposed use and development represents an unacceptable impact of the natural environment and the land and results in excessive native vegetation removal D the proposed development represents a built for a built form outcome that is inconsistent with the objectives and decision guidelines of the design and development overlay detrimental impact on the amenity of the area F the proposed use and development will result in unacceptable traffic volumes that will have a detrimental impact on local roads and traffic conditions and point to the council notes that Planning officers will pursue planning enforcement action under the planning environment act 1987 in relation to illegal works 27 and 31 gravely Point Road Raymond Island subject to any review of this decision by the Victoria Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal thank you [Applause] there any further speakers to the motion counselor Ellis sorry I 'll just in seconding just want to endorse the sentiments of councillor Roberts in this complex situation and commend the recommendation as presented before councils this evening thank you I have a question well where does this leave the developer what 's his next move gonna be because he 's not going to pull the buildings down is he we 're not pushing them that far surely what 's the next move the people just kind of walk away to develop a walk away or what mr. high councilor may suggest that the permit applicant if will have to make a decision about whether he wishes to appeal counsels decision otherwise council officers will take obviously legal advice from our planning lawyers about the extent of the enforcement that may take place and that could include anything from just a cease-and-desist requirement through to remedial works of the property any further speakers cancel the race counselors and to the members of the gallery you may be disappointed by these comments but the fear that I have is what was alluded to by mr. Hollow and an appeal to VCAT and this is an eyesore there 's no doubt about it it 's an ugly an ugly development it 's been going on for years and and it and it breaks your heart on Raymond Allen and it breaks mine as well and I wish there was an easy way around it but the fear I have is that if it is appealed at VCAT is that we have lost all control and the significant conditions have been placed over it which would have produced an outcome that might have met a lot of the concerns that 's what I 'm concerned about and my initial consideration was to support the decision to grant a permit based on that because the conditions were stringent the section 173 agreement was a legally binding agreement and the concern that I have and I think you need to hear that concern and I 've considered this and agonized over it dispassionately because I know there 's a lot of emotion in this one and there 's a lot of legacy feelings around this that 's happened from a long time and people feel very aggrieved by what 's happened and justifiably so the removal of vegetation and the developments so we 're done illegally are really they 're bad they really are bad and I wish there was a way we could run back the clock and make it good but we can 't_''_3390.12 do that and my concern is and you just need to hear that but the concern is that if they do appeal it and I have no connection to them don 't know who they are if they do appeal it and the discussion has been a worse outcome that we might have otherwise otherwise had so and we don 't want that but I have seen that before and I do put that counterpoint up there so I can 't support that alternative motion on that basis and it 's nothing personal I do love everybody on raymond island and that place thanks councillor Reeves any further speakers right off reply from Council Robert 's I don 't think I 've got anything third of that further to add apart from I do actually really feel for the proponent in this situation I do agree with councillor Buckley that if it does get to a point and if it does get appealed at VCAT and it is not it is lost I 'm hoping that that council can come to a reasonable agreement with the proponent that doesn 't necessarily result in them doing demolitions or whatever is the result because that 's not necessarily an ideal outcome either but I just don 't think that the application as it is is in these suits the the local environment so that 's me thanks thanks in favor all those against emotion is lost true six so we revert back to the officers recommendation well it 's something 's got to happen to not make a decision ladies and gentlemen puts us in a worse position than ever before we have to make a decision so unfortunately I will move this motion as originally stands thanks counselor Reeves do I have a second I counsel about Buckley very quickly if we were to refuse it we can go back and we can refuse it and then the applicant can take it to the cat and that 's at this point in time that seems to be the only logical way out of it that 's in my view otherwise we could have an alternative motion again that we relook at the thing we we adjourn it I 'm looking towards the council now to say should we adjourn it for a couple of months and talk it over and see if there 's a way out I don 't know where you have to give me advice on that mr. CEO but we 're caught in mr. CEO can you please provide some clarity on deferring the motion well madam mayor exactly there is that there is a motion that 's been recommendation of the officers has been moved it 's currently seeking a second if if if it isn 't second it would lapse for one of a second and counsel may then wish to consider its options but at the moment there is a motion on the table and then I 'll be happy to address councilor Buckley 's query council felt second motion dear wish I 'd like to talk to the reasoning I myself I tossed and toiled on this one and we 're damned if we do and we 're damned if we don 't the bottom line with this is it is a legacy building construction illegal as it may have been in the past the bottom line is it is 80% finished close to completion it is it was originally built with the best intention in mind with previous planning with plenty previous planning you know idea was around it the bottom line to me is it is something amount of Bush that 's been cleared the offices internally have worked extremely hard to come to negotiations and something reasonable reasonable for this application to move forward I do feel the hardship and I 've heard all your letters and all your phone calls and I do I do mean to say I am compassionate for your means but the bottom line is the people have an asset already in this construction and it needs to come to fruition so on those grounds I second this motion tonight thanks counselor pouts are there any further speakers against counselor Ellis there has to be some something said in relation to the support of the community and the residents that have appeared here this evening I 've read every one of the objections and the arguments on amenity through to the care for the environment and the local locale I 've read the reverses report and they do not fully in my opinion address it that or provide guarantee of proper development in this particular application that 's not to say that become the current applicant will not comply with what have a unique place in Roman Island and it needs to be protected the history of this application is throught with tragedy and as a result I believe and I encourage Kansas to rethink their their position in relation to this matter I 'm not intimidated by the concept of a cancelled decision going to VCAT and I do acknowledge counsel reads concerns but that that 's a review group we are elected to make decisions on behalf of the count of our community and to be to take into consideration their concerns as well as any proponent on any particular issue that comes before us we should not be afraid that there is another panel somewhere that 's going to challenge our decision making we should be strong decision-makers on behalf of our community those words said I do ask you again to sincerely considerate for those who have been there to that site just more recently consider what you saw and the history done and and the place that you have read thank you only for the speakers for now I 've got another question which is needed this is refused which I feel it 's gonna be like the applications gonna go down the developers going to go down what can be his next move can hear a submit another planning permit with the more satisfactory conditions and every I believe he can I think he could couldn 't he every this is refused and is that right counselor yes the applicant could submit yes the applicant could submit a new application but I do qualify that answer with technically yes they can submit in your application but the new application would have to be substantially different to the current application because counsels made a decision to reviews refused the current application if it was just submitted again the same the officers would be bound by the decision of the council previously yes yes potentially any for this week is for or against one of the matters that isn 't dealt with I think in the conditions is around the ferry use which is outside the planning matters I think it 's a timely matter at moment councillors end to remind the members of the community that at some stage in the future and we have to tie that in with inevitable growth it 's going to happen right across the Shire end on Raymond Island and to that end I think that we need to reassure everybody not just the Islanders but everybody that I think that there 's an a an opportunity for us to talk about ferry provision using a trial for on demand of the ferry rather than a strict timetable to get rid of that backlog at the peak times and that that may also assuage some of the issues not just about this development but also about big holiday times and the other users of the island so I think that that 's something that we can bring in into the council chamber in the future as well thanks counselor Reeves we 've got a motion on the table so I 'll put that all those in favor all those against motion is carried 62 five point three point five is a planning application number four twenty 27 2017 p v Penrose place Newlands are multi lot subdivision mister hollow thank at five Penrose place neons on the land is 2.3 hectare parcel the property is on a fairly large site that used to be a former farmland area the it is proposed that the subdivision would be undertaken to allow the existing dwelling to remain on one lot lot 16 is substantially constrained by topographical and some innovation issues and will not be developed and its proposed or it 's it 's we 've been informed by the applicant that lot 16 would be consolidated into the existing farm property next door at the end of this subdivision process if it was approved councils really recall there was a planning consultation meeting that was open to disobey mr. hawaii can members in the gallery please be quiet as we are still continuing through further items on the agenda please carry on me Stoli thank you madam mayor Matt Meredith you 're the council is aware that the planning consultive meme was undertaken with respect to this application where there is numerous concerns raised there was a total of 75 objections that we received by council I 'm aware council laws councils suggesting that there was additional objections rather than 75 we have done a forensic review of our file management system and it is only 75 objections and I took the liberty just to ensure that I was completely correct to take some advice from our legal advisors which says if you lodge an objection and then you Lodge further submissions as an objector you are only one objection you don 't get to lodge multiple objections so I just want to make that clear cants sorry counselor counselors this land is owned general residential zone it has an erosion management over line and is partly covered by land subject to inundation overlay the land is an elevated lakeside location and is can be easily viewed from the lake system through some Achuar vegetation that is his planted in the foreshore reserve the lands not like hiding within a bush fire management overlaid but it is bushfire prone and under the current planning policies of the state government that we have to consider the impacts of bushfire on that proposed subdivision counselors there 's been multiple multiple qualified professionals and associated with bushfire erosion flooding and they 've also been prepared and had signed off a cultural heritage management plan the land is not within the design development overlay that you 'd be familiar with with New Orleans and the land is outside of the New Orleans settlement which we believe by looking through the history of the planning scheme development and amendments that have taken place that that is an error it should have been in the design development overlay it should have been within the town boundary settlement because this land has been zoned residential for many many years on balance we believe that this application with the conditions as proposed strikes a good balance and I want to again with this particular application take you through those conditions because it may assist both the gallery and counselors with how we 've considered this application in terms of addressing some of the concerns that were raised at the planning consultative meeting and outlined in objections so counselors I 'll take you to condition two where we 've required a raft of conditions through a legal agreement that replicates our so what we 're saying is and we 've negotiated this has been offered up by the permit applicant that in order to ensure that the built form outcome is that which we 're wanting for the Newlands arm Township that we we hopefully get a consistent built form outcome on this land we 've also required that each slot must be only development developed with one dwelling no buildings must be constructed within six metres of the eastern boundary of lots nine at thirteen and no building must be constructed with six meters and other boundaries of lot six and nine that 's to protect native vegetation within the foreshore and to protect the interface with the public open space reserve to the north vehicle access from Lots to the council reserve is not permitted development of what 16 with buildings is not permitted buildings constructed and Lots must be constructed to a minimum before attack level of 12.5 which represents the findings of the bushfire management plan and bushfire documentation that was launched with the application so that gets the bushfire attack level down to a low bushfire buffer to be developed on the neighboring property and that 's also to protect these Lots from a bushfire event councilors if I could go to also condition five which talks about development of drainage infrastructure which I know there was some concerns about stormwater quality and that dovetails into some other conditions later condition six requires the development of the road to the current standards required under the court under the infrastructure design manual condition semi councillors has a construction management plan and that is to ensure that the manche of the locality and the way this subdivision is constructed is done in a sensible environmentally sensitive and in a manner that tries to maintain the immunity of the residents and and their enjoyment levels while the development is in place and taking forward we have requirements for landscaping of the streetscape we have got requirements condition eleven and twelve to ensure that erosion is made we have requirements to be connected to services we have requirements by the different authorities who have all consented to the application to connect to services we have requirements to also ensure farming land but comes into the site and we 've got requirements there to make sure that stormwater is collected on-site used on-site and we 've got requirements to ensure that we hopefully can reduce nutrient flows and make sure that the lake system remains in good health councils happy to take questions thanks mr. hollow have questions counselor Ellis yeah I do apologize before for breaking news very good I just wanted to clarify you your opening statement and that was that you stated that you 'd receive 75 written objections but that 's not to say that you didn 't receive 91 submission it 's contrib ejected to the application is that correct thanks counselor that 's fair to say 75 objections but we have got further submissions from objectors in relation to further considerations they may have point taken but it 's still a substantial amount of objections to a planning application indeed counselor tui thank you madam mayor Aaron in condition condition six the roadworks it 's noted air condition six a fully sealed pavement for the X for the road minimum effective width of 6 be is that this standard width for a street of this size given that at the beginning of the street it has a center median so it sort of changes immediately once it goes into this development so councilor yes it is the standard width and councils will recall that the state government changed the planning scheme requirements for roads to get consistency across the state in terms of what the roads carry what which they are what traffic volumes they hold I was to also ensure that we 're not over developing and putting too much cost on developers of having large extensive roadways which are necessary for the traffic volumes that they carry so yes it 's consistent it 's consistent with the infrastructure design manual approved by an adopted by council as consistent with state provisions given the the locality here and my thoughts go to cars with boats particularly in this locality and and potentially caravans I am aware of some of the the six meter wide street I assume they 're six meter wide streets in some some subdivisions and the the fact that it particularly if there 's cars parked in the street so do we have the ability to ask for any more than what is there or would that be shown to be going outside of what we should be doing I don 't believe we should be asking for above and beyond there are requirements and standards in the planning scheme and in the infrastructure design manual they have been adopted by council and I think we have been uneasy waters if we did so further questions councils counselor hours I 'd like to raise the question of amenity and appropriate amounts of blocks one of the 75 accepted objections the message of amenity has been a strong strong point flowing through there in planning law what strength does the question of amenity have in terms of decision making in terms of decision making counselor it 's one of the key concerns I 've counseled so in this case there was a Shandy of many issues but also neighborhood character issues you would have recalled in the planning consolidating many people were concerned about the extent and size of the Lots undertake a revision of their subdivision to ensure that each lock was at least a minimum a thousand square meters to reflect the minimum subdivision size in accordance with the design development overlay on the rest of the township of New Orleans arm in terms of further amenity in particular loss of views that is a matter that the vacate is to determine quite extensively on within the last five years to say if there 's an option of you atchoo being it should be made and I think we 're we 're partly going to achieve that with the use of that section 173 agreement to replicate the design development overlay controls in terms of making sure that the general amici from matters such as dust noise tons of construction we 've covered that in a construction management plan as well taking note of the fact that we 're talking about 1,000 square meter blocks was there any consideration given to me the wider general size of the blocks within the Newlands arm community that the design of that particular location to say 2500 square meter blocks to allow you don 't almost feel like being in the supreme court win the castle here in relation to that that feeling that vibe of vision and feeling called the community of Newlands are probably said too many words well did you consider 2500 square metres at an appropriate a more appropriate size of the allotment and two wooden would not there are larger blocks and meet the general amenity if that 's the right word I 'm looking for in terms of the community or the the design of newland tom yes Kansas so I think I understand where you 're coming from so the Lots traditionally as they 've been developed a long Newlands arm itself have been larger than a thousand square meters as you start coming away from those water blocks they 're now generally around a thousand square meter and the thousand square meters is not a miracle number it comes from the fact that New Orleans arm was an appropriate subdivision and lots had to be consolidated to get lot sizes up to a thousand square meters we think in this situation thousand Lots is and in this situation we also have got a competing requirement where when you 're developing residential land you 're meant to develop it to make best use of services and and reticulated infrastructure we think we have struck a decent balance here so that what we 've got is we 've got development and a good density and we 've got development the reflects the majority of the light sizes of the township sorry but if I was don 't say an acre of land at New England 's arm would it be more appropriate and better use of that land to have it subdivided down into say three or four smaller blocks of a third let 's say a thousand square metres then keeping it as a one lakeside prop north-facing property difficult one to answer counselor because new lands arm is not the typical estate it is subject to the restructure overlay so that in some cases you can 't re subdivide but also there 's the other competing issue within the planning scheme that says you 've got to make best use of service land and be making best use of it but we 're also got to take into consideration the neighborhood character and given yep and given the the one thousand square metre neighborhood character for the majority of lots within the knee lands and Township we believe that we 've we 've reached a good balance and it 's consistent with the requirements of design development overlay on the majority of the New Orleans arm state on to take from those words that the application before it is seen to be in that good neighborhood sense yes we 've taken the view that 's consistent with the neighborhood character Council the Reeves thanks Maron I think lot 16 includes that waterway just out of curiosity how is water in that waterway treated in terms of who owns it because it looks like it spans different owners or yeah and how do we maintain the quality of that water across ownership yep so counselor when we visited this site on a couple of occasions half the lagoon is on the crown land for short or a significant person parcel of is on the crown is on private land it 's been part of a farming Enterprise for many years there 's a larger waterway that runs towards that Lagoon from the farming area that 's why there 's a requirement to enter into a waterway management plan and also requirements in conditions to make sure that the drainage of the residential lots utilizes rainwater tanks and also utilizes rainwater gardens to ensure that the quality of drainage that will eventually lead to that Lagoon in some circumstances for some Lots is it a better quality than what it would be if it was to just simply be pipe and petered into that Lagoon any further questions councillors council palace moves to recommend recommendation do we have a seconder thanks counselor Buckley councillor parts do you wish to speak to it that 's not to say I took my father down here this morning to have a good look at this block for a drive and and we thought originally that the sizes of the blocks were probably a bit on the smaller side and then reiterating back on the information tonight a lot of know the the bigger numbers the bigger number blocks seem to be within more realistic to the the sizes of the Newlands arm project original project you know 1,300 or 1100 was a lot of the newer ones were like 14 a lot of the old ones were like 1,400 but to me this is a lovely piece of land and I 'm sure in the future there 'll be some really in people some people really appreciative of these blocks and I think the staff have done a good job negotiating the terms and points that need to be covered I 'm happy to move the recommendation thanks council pouts councillor Buckley do you wish to speak to it just because I second it it doesn 't mean to say I need to speak to it now I 'm posing it I think those blocks are too small now you look up your local government actor I only moved at just a break a deadlock yeah and to to break a deadlock no I think those that blocks it they 're too small it 's there there 's enough what I think it 's packing I 'm in a bit much and we 've got funny room in this in this locality to have bigger ones and no recommendation okay thank you madam oh yes counsel Italy sorry Aaron if I could just clarify the fact that this subdivision as presented its within the guidelines of the zoning that it sits within all be that zoning and anomaly this is within those those guidelines is that correct correct do I have any further speakers for the motion further speakers against I 'll speak against it councillors look I think you know Shire being out to provide a range of land product is really important and Newlands arm it represents that I think it provides a range of products and opportunities for for development and I think making all a lot smaller and comply with some of the developments that are a nearby colony circle I think it 's called I think in consistent with blocks that are larger around new lands arm that are facing the water and that 's my concern so there 's two of them actually is the the view of the land from the water which is often something that 's not considered so to have a high intensive development there the amenity of the view from the lakes and then we want the likes to be a thriving recreational fishing destination and we want that that view back onto the land I think to be consistent there are other sites around the lake around Raymond Island Painesville where there 's high higher intensive development around the lake but I think on this particular occasion I think the consistency around new lands are having bigger blocks is what sort of swayed me so I think the another development has many merits but I can 't support it because of that shoreline amenity and the the smaller block size that 's proposed as well as their many other concerns that have been raised by the objectors councillor hours I don 't do corroborate councillor Reeves comments and revert back to my tongue tiredness earlier and trying to identify the word neighborhood character and and and ask councils to think about new lands arm and the character original developers and the advantage of taking at full advantage of a northern aspect piece of land abutting the Gippsland lakes the values are coming through by both on water and off water to say neighborhood character being selected along here I think the blocks you know I have been creased a little insight from earlier earlier information but I think I have to agree with council Reeves in relation to the consideration of this particular environment I oppose the application I think it 's canceled Ellis any further speakers councillor we thank you mad at me I must say after looking at looking at the the plan that has been provided and looking at the the properties along Colony Club Drive which is where we 're talking about neighborhood character what I have found is that a lot of those Lots on the on Colony Club Drive with the north-facing aspect certainly appear to be similar in width to the proposed Lots the only difference being that the that those Lots are much longer in length than the than the proposed so my opinion of the view either from are a very similar size they just vary in depth so from a neighborhood character point of view I do believe that they would be very similar from a visual point of view now would that be fair to say size wise width wise in particular that they would be similar Aaron would have you any idea there in terms of width on the northern side you 're somewhat going to be close to it yes you 're pretty close but certainly you 're correct from a debt to perspective that these lots are quite don 't quite have the depth thanks counselor tui any further speakers counselor pelts do should have a right over apply okay I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against motion is lost three five so we have an alternative motion just to help out there than me it 's too late the met has been put to the vote and it was just lost five through our three five there was no no offer by any counselor to put forward an alternative nation at during the debate okay remuneration policy sorry sure we will okay we 'll just have a break for two minutes while we clear the gallery and councils need to Oh some people are leaving oh sorry sorry I just meant while they are leaving excuse me counselors on behalf of the mayor I would like to invite you all back into the chamber okay item 5.1.1 is draft chief executive officer employment and remuneration policy madam mayor I 'd just like to confirm that I do have a conflict of interest a direct conflict does this matter directly rates to myself and my employment thanks mr. CEO I will now ask mr. Mecca Astin to speak to the report thank you and good evening councillors this report seeks councils adoption of the draft chief executive officer employment and remuneration policy new policy the purpose of this policy is to support the requirements of the Local Government Act by establishing an advisory committee known as the CEO employment and Remuneration Committee to help council fulfill its obligations in respect of determining the CEOs performance criteria determining or assessing the CEOs performance against that criteria and the mayor there may be a past mare and to other councils appointed by Council and an independent member there are three recommendations before council tonight thanks miss Aston are there questions from the councillors thanks counselor Reeves thanks counselor Ellis councillor raves do you wish to speak no I think there 's nothing said and we 've seen this report and it 's detailed in its content thanks council race council Ellis thank you no further speakers Oh counselor 2e_._6080.79 thank you madam mayor there was a lot of work that was put into this by a number of us that have been involved with it and I think the outcome is is exactly what we were after from the point of view of ensuring that number one we follow at the statutory requirements and number two that we get a good outcome for our community which is what we 're here for thank you I said counselor tui no further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you miss Aston 5.1 0.2 is the draft annual financial statements mr. Collins thank you madam mayor council every year is required to submit an annual report to the Minister for local government within three months at the end of the financial year as part of that process the audited financial and performance statements are included in the annual report in order to meet the timeline requirements council would normally appoint two councillors to sign the certification on the financial statements and the performance statement in their final form once the Auditor General has given their approval for that to happen that approval has now come through already and council is in a position now to appoint two councillors to sign those certifications in their final form also to note that this morning at the Audit Committee meeting the order to spoke to the audit the financial statements of performance statement and their management report and final closing comments the Audit Committee at that meeting recommended the council appointed to councillors to sign and the certifications in their final form as per the report and the recommendation to Knight thank you mad at me thanks miss Collins are there any questions the recommendation and with the inclusions of pointing councillor O 'Connell and councillor white in those breaks pace spaces to be signing off on the statement please thanks council parts do we have a seconder thanks counselor II can 't slop outs you wish to speak to it well I 'd like to say thank you losing your team for our financial statements I feel our capsules in good stead in underneath your controls and you 're always honest and true with regards to anything that 's arising I 'm happy for this to be adopted tonight thank you thanks council pouts councillor 2e_:_6264.8 any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thanks miss Collins item five point one point three petition degradation of delegate River Road and bridges and boning Road Bridge by log trucks councillor pouts I 'd like to declare a conflict of interest on this one in regards to the load trucks that they 're talking about are part of our family business operation thank you thanks counselor pouts I 'll now ask Miss Fiona Weigel to speak reporter for each night is in response to a petition from residents of the delegate river regional area that originally went to the member for Gibson and has been referred to Council it is around the condition of both the delegate River Road and the biowing Road and it 's asking Council to provide a suspension of the use of those roads by log trucks as councils are aware only one of those roads it 's actually a council controlled Road the other Road is actually as detailed in the body of the report and our manager works it 's been up to that area and inspected the roads and whilst it 's acknowledged that there is some wear and tear to those roads it 's not considered that it is of the level that will require the suspension of the the use of the road by logging trucks and there 's detailed in the report it really looks like the roads are getting to the point in their life where they just need a Ravelry sheet and that will be organized for them and therefore the the recommendations before commit the use of log trucks on the delicate River Road and notes that we will only take some actions including writing to the haulage company and requesting their consideration of the community 's concerns and that they minimize the use of our Road and that we reshape the delegate River Road it 's a tow alias convenient and then we then get picture the petitioners and with the advice of our actions we 're going to take however having said that we also acknowledge that the bowling road is not in this good condition and therefore there is a final recommendation before you tonight counsel is that we also write to the premier and the Minister for roads I 'm requesting the victorian government invests in sealing the final 12 kilometres from the unsealed section of the burning road and the upgrade and the maintenance of McKellips Road is thank you thanks miss Vogel are there any questions councillors counselor Ellis I 'm taking to account these are timber roads and the issues that we 've had with cross-border movements of timber trucks with our neighbors from the Monaro that one of the bridges is on the border area in terms of cooperation in terms of management of these roads so we 've certainly started those conversations and will continue to have those conversations with our neighboring councils across the border and this is really an issue that we can also raise with the cross border commissioner if we see fit and won 't believe we have a meeting with the cross border Commissioner coming up very shortly it 's because from time to time those routes will change and that gives that the council is the opportunity to work collectively to make sure that we 're not just looking after our rights but looking after the roads generally in that region thanks counselor Ellis councillor II thank you madam mayor Fiona the point three and the recommendation carry out a gravel reshoot of delegate River Road at the earliest convenience can you give us some time frame in regards to that to some extent it 's about the availability of contractors owners councils are aware this is quite a remote location so we just need to make sure place we have a it 's get a panel of contractors that we can go to so we don 't we can act on that quite quickly so I 'm confident that we should be able to reshape this before Christmas councillor Roberts I 'm having trouble finding the the specific line where it says it but I remember previously we discussed that there was a limit of four trucks from the company that 's that correct okay I should say it 's currently fully understanding it from conversations with the the haulage company is there 's currently four trucks per day each way and there 's single axle trucks so we have requested that the contractor keep through you said about that level have we got any controls or any follow up on on ensuring that that 's comply to the controls can place when it gets to the the companies submitting a harvest plan and that 's when we can actually put some conditions on how the roads are used as part of that harvesting plan until next time there is a harvesting plan submitted we can tighten managed and maintained yes I guess the point of my question was for day-to-day operations that we don 't have any direct control on ensuring that those numbers are adhered to only if we have a planning permit that stipulates that which is what we look to do next time around when we have a logging type approval sensory-type so at the moment there 's no actual controls that we can place on this road it 's about looking at that into the future what we can do is maintain make sure that we 're maintaining our road to the best availability and work with the contractor to ensure that they look using the roads appropriately you know you know and in an informal way essentially an in faith agreement that 's right councillor Alice know this question probably should be placed with the next item in relation to the southeast Australian Transport strategy group each the burning highway listed with that group is one of our East Gippsland principle projects and being so topical on with both the local member and in local interest Thank You councillor elephant most priorities to the seats group and that was one of them we 've also been working quite diligently with our colleagues at regional roads Victoria to keep this on their agenda as well and requesting that they 're going up and expecting the roads regularly and also requesting and that consideration is given to for funding the final sealing of the final Road we also put in our advocacy documents to both the federal government and the state government leading up to both of those elections so yes we have been advocating on behalf community to to push this along any further questions thanks counselor to e for moving it do I have a seconder thanks counselor Reeves do you wish to speak to a counselor to we cancel Reeves sure I 'll say quick words we 've got some some good community friends strong community up there sometimes I feel a little isolated I feel closer to New South Wales and Victoria but on this occasion I think that this is a bit of an indication that we are listening we are reacting and we are being proactive around other councillors have received many calls from members of the community up there I think you have I certainly have and and this is this is important and we should continue that advocacy around those last twelve kilometres of the boning but let 's get the roads that are in our remit into a good condition well done to all those involved in particular our residents and friends up around delegate boning and bin doc thanks counselor Reeves any further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against motion is carried six-one item five point can someone get council felt tonight thank you five point two point one is place feature name proposal Topher Hill thank you Miss Collins thank you madam mayor this report seeks counsel endorsement of a proposal to name a feature on the job Enzo dog I wrote in the in the locality of Wolper as telfa Hill councils are aware we received a proposal some time ago and as the office of geographic place names requires council to do we undertook the public consultation in terms of that of the office of geographic place names requirements for naming of a feature there are no objections received in terms of the proposal this is the last step that counsel is required to undertake in terms of providing endorsement before it is submitted the proposal is submitted to the office of geographic place names and there 's a recommendation before you tonight councillors thank you thanks miss Collins questions councillors motion before council what you you wish to move it thank you have a seconder council buckley thank you council why do you wish to speak to the recommendation thank you madam mayor some time ago a very concise and passionate letter was written into I said council regarding this matter the Telfer name is is a very old family name of that area and I think it 'll be wonderful for those residents and the descendants of the TEL fastest he see that name used for that part of Wolper and I just fully endorsed that we we get this over the line and we can have a couple of nice ones on each side of Wolper there 's Buckley do you wish to had anything can 't count for two II just in support of the motion I must say that some of the decisions that were made to not have been agonizingly hard this was very very easy to support yeah great recommendation thanks counselor to a counselor pouts yes I 'm just not just say I 'm thank you for riding in this one the stories were great behind the base of it all and I think um I really enjoyed it and they were really warranted the naming of tell flick Hill and yeah thank you for sharing your story with us thanks handsome pelts put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thanks miss Collins item 5.2 point to membership of Southeast Australian transport strategy seats thanks counselor pouts i 'll ask miss Weibull to speak to the report thank you madam mayor um the reason for this report is that there 's been a new organization set up in in Canberra it 's a regional joint organization and there 's been some queries about whether that duplicates the whether we should still continue to be a member of service which is says councils would all be aware of the Southeast Australian Transport strategy group which advocates on transport matters for councils and groups between Melbourne and Sydney along the eastern seaboard councils been a member of this group for many years and has had many of its projects advocated for by this group and that 's really well documented I believe in the body of the report the camera regional joint organisation is a more recently formed organization and council sits on there is an associate member looking at the objectives of the two organizations we can see very little overlap and therefore the recommendation before you this evening is that we recognize that both the Southeast Australia transport strategy and the camera regional join of those Asian groups as having different objections and therefore there is minimal overlap between the organization 's charters and objectives and therefore we continue to be a member of the seats thank you and happy to take any questions thanks miss while or questions thanks counselor to e counselor our second do some of the benefits of being a member of this organization I agree absolutely with the recommendation and it 's a very good summary of exactly the benefit that seats has to our area so thank you thanks counselor to a counselor Ellis there 's no real point of citizen and well established successful lobby group representing both Victoria and New South Wales councils and has been doing so for many years now the alternative group is a regional group yet to really provide any real benefit or showing you real benefit to e skiffs then sure they were very pleased to be able to partner with them and look forward to further cooperation to our mutual benefit in the future but seats is our principle group and I support Council to each words and you further speakers councils put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously council pelts will rejoin item five point two point three disability advisory committee progress report 2018 welcome miss Tasha John 's to speak to the report thank you madam mayor I 'm pleased to present to you the committee supports council to work towards more diverse accessible and inclusive communities the committee have provided advice on things that matter to people with a disability and a framework for council to consult on access and inclusion related issues the report found in Appendix 1 has been developed by the members of the committee with the support of council offices and it highlights the work undertaken during 2018 it covers areas including transport in the built environment recognizing the critical nature of

questions from the counselors thanks counselor Ellis counselor Pelt second at counselors do do is wish to speak to the recommendation very briefly madam mayor I 'm very humbled to be able to be the council representative on this Advisory Committee to counsel as sasha is identified and the committee 's made up of some terrific people who each carried their own story and life experiences the country to my experiences and I 'm really grateful that they 're able to share that the Advisory Committee provides counsel with the I into the life experience of someone who may be caught in a wheelchair or this vision impaired or any other those disabilities that impact we take four great issues that we take for granted become quite difficult for them the the committee was particularly honored on that the recent meeting will express their thanks to council and you madam me for being able view to council and as an advisory committee I look forward to them coming to Council and providing insights into the issues that we 're responsible for on a more regular occurrence I commend the motion before you thanks counselor Ellis can slip out this I just like to say I reiterate my colleagues words just now and and also would like to contribute the fact that these people you know they 're fantastic at their work and they make out the lives for many of other people many other people that have similar issues in the community a lot easier and their work over the years has been it 's been substantiated with some of the implication in inputs that we 've been able to implicate in to our own in everyday life and some of our Road rules some of our just everyday let 's go down the street kind of situations from you know all ability parking places and you know ramps everything and they 've actually highlighted a lot of areas that our region was not was not doing so well with we were failing in really added depth to and a second thought to our everyday building in construction of public amenities public facilities and you know I take my hat off to them I really appreciate their contribution to our council thank you and your work to Setia thanks counselor pouts council arrays mayor are we too light to suggest a addition to the recommendation made of me wrong I 'm happy to accept a correction to the motion that I 've obviously made well thank thanks counselor Alice it was just that the recommendation at this stage notes the advisory committees progress report but as as per our meeting councillors when the advisory committee were with us I made the comment that really that work the rubber hits the road of that work if we use the advisory committees lens on life through all the decisions we make as best we can and I said that to the CEO at the time that um you know do do we put a lens on our decisions on our actions and processes that makes us a more inclusive Council as a result and I 'm some words in there about doing that to ensure that the decisions we make as a council are inclusive so not just noting that somehow have an action in there as well councillors I haven 't got the words at the moment but counselor Ellis Azzam the committee the representative on committee would that be useful and helpful I yeah I 'd think you counsel reach for that assistance and direction and I and I would like to take full advantage of that I think that if we could have words such as the council has acknowledges the advice and were and inside into a were a need to be inclusive or something like that that 's we could look to the words mr. councillor Roberts might come up with something for me but I 'm looking for a present that the issues of recognition of disability and inclusion and in our decision-making yeah so perhaps we could habit some words to the effect that council acknowledges the insight provided by members of the committee into issues of inclusion and the challenges met by persons we face by persons with 'll go back yeah no no I 'm grateful for you to do councillor Alice can you just counsel Alice can you please just go over to Colleen and check that the words to clarify the wedding Rock councils do that for us to which an or okay counselor raised this is your amendment so I 'm asking you to please read it out so the alternative motion is that council notes use keeps the entire council disability Advisory Committee progress report has provided at appendix one and acknowledges the advice and insights provided to improve an understanding of the needs and challenges for our community to be more inclusive sounds terrific Thank You counselors mr. CEO counselors and through you madam mayor I think we 're actually amending the you 're amending the recommendation so it simply requires someone to second that amendment mark do we have a seconder thanks counselor white okay do you wish to speak any further to council what no okay we 've got the amended motion before you so yep I 'll put the amendment to the vote all those in favor motion is motion I would just simply ask councils to support the motion before them and ask you to put it to the vote thanks counselor Ellis I 'll put it to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you Miss Jones item five point three point one future Land Management Arrangements Bullock island Lakes Entrance Wagle thank you madam mayor council is the discussion Moran Bullock Island it 's been held around this table many times and goes back not just to the adoption of the volatile and master plan in 2015 but beyond that to the adoption of the Lakes Entrance portion or management plan which recognized Bullock Island there 's a very significant part of the foreshore and a tourism node for Lakes Entrance I don 't think I need to talk to you about the importance of Lakes Entrance other than to say that for many years now we 've been looking at the tenure Arrangements around Bullock Island and how to make them work when we adopted the volatile and master plan back in 2015 there was a requirement for us to look at for the public land areas of Bullock Island remembering that there 's also some land that is managed by left call some that has managed by Gibbs land ports and some that is by Gibbs managed by get phone tags and Federation University so that has taken a little bit of time because we 've investigated the quality of sea walls and really worked with them to help us the Crown land representative to get to a point where we understand the condition of the assets and believe what we have come to a point where we can suggest to Council that we enter into a partnership agreement with with Dell to provide for the management and future development of Pollak Island and that partnership agreement in its draft form is provided as Appendix 1 to this report and there 's basically really that says that we wouldn 't take on the management of the sea walls but we would take on the management of the the public land including the roads including looking at provision of public toilets including some of the landscaping and the pathways around the island to council and is that that 's outlined in the financial section of the report it really is looking at concept about with myself in the report over four hundred thousand four hundred seventy five thousand dollars in capital upgrade and then ongoing maintenance costs so while what we 're suggesting in the recommendations of the report is that we also investigate some of the land that we 're currently managing on behalf of the crown that comes with a cost to council that we might be able to return back to the the crown in so that we offset some of the costs the agreement that is provided it 's a partnership agreement also has some suggestions around how we may be able to offset some of those costs recognizing that we can 't just keep taking on new and managing new assets but also recognizing the importance of this particular effort in this particular area to both the Lakes Entrance community and to the visitor economy for our region Thanks councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor Fiona it says here costs of implementing the entire master plan have costs you just mentioned that you would like to offset some of the costs by returning some crown land to the Victorian Government is there any guarantee that the victorian government wants to take the crown land back and can you foresee a figure that might be able to be returned from that crown land because five five million dollars plus maintenance cost is not insignificant and I can 't think of any other crown land that would probably cost council close to that much money it correct me if I 'm wrong but it 's a big chunk of change the five million dollars is really to reconfigure Bullock island and reconfigured some of those public spaces so that means the moving of quite a load for the road network and the upgrading of the public open space is quite significantly so the five million dollars isn 't really master play it 's for the master plan and we would be thinking we would only be doing that work if we can work with Delft and others to seek external funding and then we 'd be looking at how undertaken so that the maintenance is it 's as lower cost maintenance as possible while still providing that amenity the only works that we 're suggesting that need to be undertaken at the moment I 'm taking it on the the community management responsibilities for the island will breed a provision of a public toilet we 're aware that there is no public toilet until you get to the fishing club which really some would suggest isn 't really a bullet island so it 's a long way and it 's a very popular fishing spot so we think that we need to do something around a public toilet relatively quickly and we need to bring the roads up to a reasonable standard at the moment the road network is not under standard that we would have under our right management agreement and and we really need to bring it up so we 're suggesting that we bring it up to a reasonable standard and jelp has already made a contribution towards that there 's been a 50,000 contribution made towards that and then we 're suggesting that we just asset so give it that dust suppression seal beyond that the maintenance is really around that ninety seven thousand dollars per annum until we get to the implementation of the MRSA poem which we 'll be looking at how we offset some of those additional costs that would come with further upgrading came with like a I accept the cost is for him it 's a what essentially a one-off for implementing the master plan because it 's going to be considerable works that are required I asked before about is there any guarantee that the crown we are the victorian government will accept land so really we 've discussed this with Delft and they understand our position on that so we 've worked with them on this agreement and also some of the other arrangements that we would believe would need to be put in place and so we can hand land back to the that 's not an unusual thing for the local government or an entity to do if it feels it 's no longer able to manage it or there 's a better management arrangement we 't believe we 've done it regularly but I believe we have so what we 're doing now is working out which was the both most appropriate to hand back to the ground councillor hours mayor if there were no other further questions not to foreshadow that I 'll move move the recommendation before us and okay yeah councillor tui thank you madam mayor Fiona my question is along the lines of Jackson 's position point four in the recommendation states that we that could potentially be returned to the crown now I would be very hesitant at agreeing to this if we 're working on a potential hand back in so far as potential means may not happen it may I see it and I I then assume that let 's call it hundred thousand dollars per annum that that 's an extra burden of 100,000 per annum if that doesn 't happen so is there any guarantee can we can we put in some stronger wording to ensure that that doesn 't happen what we 're doing is working through along this buildings that we 're currently maintaining for those facilities and there are a number of facilities that are facilities and we believe that we can amalgamate my hand back some components of those facilities without negatively impacting on those communities in those areas so that Peter work just wasn 't quite ready to come as a companion piece with this recommendation and we knew that there was some keenness to get this before council given that we 're moving we 're moving into the summer holiday period and it would be nice to have some of the works that on the island prior to Christmas so that full-time is well presented so that 's why they haven 't come as a companion piece there are we were looking at some figures today there are 60 holes and reserves and things like that that a crown reserves that we have some sort of management responsibility for without being the committee of management so that 's where we 'd start looking at those ones and then we have a long list of land that we 're managing that has no obvious community benefit at the moment Council what I understood for some time that the council really only maintained the breach and the short piece of Pietschmann Road onto the island and the Delp of been in control for a long time is is there any reason why they have not at this stage undergone any any development themselves it 's a reason why they would expect council to to take on the responsibility so for our discussions with Delta around understanding how their budget process works and it was quite different to ours so whereas we would have a maintenance budget my road maintenance budget or parks and gardens budget that is out on your ongoing operating budget that funding has to be bid for every year in that process is my understanding and therefore there 's not that guarantee the funding coming forward it 's all based on priorities across the state and how how it fits so therefore whilst they have money to some money in some bethe budgets in some periods they don 't have the same surety and the same certainty that we can provide and recognizing that it is a tourism asset be maintained on an ongoing fashion not maintained one year and then not the other which is why we 've really undertaken these consultations with them Telfer very keen on if you reach through the partnership agreement I came to keep working with us and try to work out how they can continue to contribute to the ongoing maintenance and I think the goodwill they 're shown in finding some money to contribute to the road networks demonstrates that there is a real willingness and that 's captured in this partnership agreement that it 's not just pass it to Council and then walk away it 's about us continuing to work together on how we 're going to continue to fund the maintenance councillor Roberts thanks again madam mayor Fiona I have the predicted implementation cost of this master plan and maintenance going forward being included in the budgets up until this point or is this going to be an additional that will be have to that will have to be factored in next year or even into this year 's budget oh we have the capacity within our 't budgeted for the toilet because we really need to do some planning and design and costing around how long 's the extension will be but we would need to take that that into a future budget or seek external funding beyond that we have even when we adopted the master plan made no commitment to funding the upgrades in the master plan so they would all be subject to us being able to attract external funding for those those upgrades so really at the moment we already provide a limited rubbish service to the island because there wasn 't when we recognized that that didn 't showcase our tourism assets if there was rubbish everywhere so we 've been providing a limited rubbish service to the island for some time as the councillors pointed out the road and the bridge is already our assets so that 's budgeted for so once we put a dust suppression C or on the roads it 's so the limited maintenance budget for those every year and then it 's the cleaning cost of a toilet once we have that in place which of the attachments sorry I don 't have the attachment oh it 's a big attachment I do have it so the five million dollars is projected for the total master plan is projected to be it 's but it 's it 's projected to be spent over one year two years this is going to be a a short term out letters there 's going to be a five ten year development what does that sort of look like really unless we found funding for it it would be a very long-term outcome we 've been putting this into budget bids that we 've been working with with the state through their process we 've been putting it in for Commonwealth funding through things like the Regional Growth Fund and so we will continue to keep packaging elements of it up but I would say that honestly it 's probably a ten year program and we would need to when we 're looking at those funding opportunities look at this is a priority against our other projects that they meet those funding criteria as well this doesn 't mean projects that may be eligible for that funding as well we need to go through and went through a prioritization process with council about what funding we were going to apply for councillor pout well Fiona can you just remind me there was an audit done on dope and it wasn 't so favourable with regards to the state of their assets and virtually which means of saying a lot of these things and can you just in light of those issues Thank You counselor pals there was a vago report done an order undertaken on the state of coastal assets throughout Victoria and the investment in the state in those assets and it you 're quite right it wasn 't glowing in its rec in its findings and it made a series of recommendations about how to improve it some of which are being picked up with by the near coastal and marine act and I think there 's also a lot of work by council and other local governments on coastal areas throughout Victoria to advocate for more funding to be put back into our coastal areas so our our coastal assets and the advocating for job two or whoever the right agency is to receive that funding to maintain coastal assets for communities throughout Victoria and using examples such as Bullock Island as examples of why there is a need for further funding for these assets so let me understand this the assets that we would be potentially giving back to the crown would be you know favourable most suitable maintained Manor and we actually gained something that is needs five million dollars spent on it and he 's in such a favourable maintained manner the aspiration would be to spend five million dollars on it just as we have master plans for streetscapes and for structure plans that have a whole outline of works that we aspiration that we work with the community to implement over a time that is the aspiration and the master plan is very much an aspirational document so it 's not necessary to spend the entire five million dollars to bring the asset up to a suitable condition what we 're suggesting is looking at the quality of the roads and an extended rubbish service and providing a toilet service would have a capital cost of about four hundred and seventy five thousand dollars an ongoing maintenance of ninety seven so we 've been looking back to hand back assets that had a similar maintenance value of that around ninety seven hundred thousand dollars as we said the agreement also identifies that there 's opportunity for council to become a third party to some of the leases that the commercial leases that the crown already has on other assets in the local area and in the lakes entrance area which would derive an income stream for us without actually having to take over those assets or maintain those assets so we 're also working hard with Jeff on those because they 're another source of income for us that doesn 't require the handing back in assets but would provide us with an ongoing income stream that 's linked to the commercial lease of those assets just further on that line of questioning there 's no time frame on the recommendation around offsetting some of those costs so if they 're offsetting that cost is there a get out clause just as we 've talked about Hanna gather back other bits of Crown land to the crown there would be the opportunity to hand that Bullock island to the crown and could they refuse it I 'll check with my colleagues but on I don 't believe you can refuse to take that crown land which is Carl and it is we are authorized as the committee of management so we manage the crown land on their behalf it is still always Crown land and therefore what would be saying is we no longer want to be the committee of management which would mean that it elapsed and if there is no other community management it returns back to Delfina returns to the crown through dealt to manage directly any further questions counselor OS counselor to e counselor Ellis do wish to speak to the recommendation the garland saga is something for you know for counselors to learn about this was one of the mattes I first stood for counsel for was the were the improvement and the promotion of the it 's a very popular site and from tourism usage and culturally for the well-being of the town it 's even incredibly important so to tidy it up from the neglect that it was exposed to by the crown and in particular by adult and I don 't point the finger at them in any particular way because they simply don 't have the budgeting to take care of many odd their assets input and the tourism is not their business as such this is a this is really an important decision of counsel for the community of likes entrance as I say it 's been with me for a very long time and this behind is providing information to you we 've been through so many meetings creation of plans from the for management plan community consultations on different aspects exercise walks pathway walk all sorts of things in and culminating with really the the next episode which is the Jimmy 's point development the importance of this particular run recommendation before us is that the Quran has maintained ownership of the sea walls I would not have supported and the question on the Choi was from in relation to the state looking at delp 's coastal management assets identified sea walls across the state in fact in Lakes Entrance I think that cost is up to thirty million dollars worth of work to be to be done we could not accept that and this is quite an achievement and and and it 's a calming a commendation to officers in the negotiating process that we were able to exclude the the sea walls from it if any council cares to traveled down to bulla Cole and I will see people of all nationalities taking advantage of what the island has to wear and provide right now with improved passive and recreational activity facilities there and I 'm talking about simple things like pathways grassed areas and tables and chairs and of course the the health of a decent toilet the usage of this particular iron will undoubtedly increase in being at an attraction to the town so in these few words I really look to you to support this recommendation before you tonight and to address some of into account I think the Shah has about thirty eight kilometers worth of urban foreshore under its committee of management responsibilities there is one one little area down at a faraway place called mallacoota that we could easily return to the Quran or to delve in that being best in point boat ramp I 'm sure that we would find that the exposure from Bullock Island would be reduced dramatically so counselors on that frivolous note I put the recommendation to you Thank You councillor tui do you wish to speak thank you madam mayor after those few words miss counselor Ellis put it I do believe that management of this particular asset is far better vested in Council instead of Delp said that it is to say that they 'll don 't have the funding to look after an asset that belongs to them the stupidity of that is you know mind-blowing to be honest but having said that if we can offset the costs incurred in doing this I believe that council is far better placed to to look after Bullock Island and maintain that in a manner in general would like to see it maintained so I say this is a positive thing I agree wholeheartedly with counselor Ellis in regards to the sea walls I would not be voting for this if they were included so I see this is a great outcome for Lakes Entrance and a great outcome for our into our community thank you there any speakers against councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor and I don 't disagree with the word that uh counselor Ellis and councillor he just said but one of my main concerns is I feel that with our tight economic situation at the moment rate increases it 's been a common theme I would like to see that we find the money first before we commit to a project like this and given that this project doesn 't appear to be completed tomorrow this is a long-term project I think we 've got we 've got the time to be able to budget for it correctly and have that discussion bit about returning Bastion point or otherwise and then slightly change the order because once the money was but I 've just really hesitant to push the additional burden on at the right pair at this point thank you speakers four speakers against ya I 'm gonna speak against this I 'm not comfortable I think there 's too many loose ends and open-ended issues in there for me to commit to this at this stage me for this speakers counselor Ellis you should have a writer apply appreciate the care of our ratepayers it 's something I share but I see why divan benefits by do the acquisition of Bullock island under air care as a committee of management if it 's shown that it 's to be such a burden that we are unable to manage it properly which is something I would dare then as we 've been advised we can return it to the crown I in response to calories comment so acknowledges comments and I have no further comment in relation to it I just ask that councils support the motion before us then make a lot of people makes entrance very happy thank you I put the motion to you all those aye I think I 'll remain then as the status quo which is to not take it on to throw it against it okay next is five point three point two which is the proposed changes to male waste transfer station level of service Fiona waggle Oh Karthik sorry thank you madam a good evening counselors this report seeks endorsement billion from Council to approve the reduction of how is it Marlow transfer station to three hours over for spread of four days from seven days operation and also note that the proposal of the mallow transfer station opening hours and bringing its requirement to upgrade the facility in this financial year for which we have a budget allocated as part of our capex program so council is just to give a gift of this whole strategy the waste facilities and disposal strategy was endorsed and approved by council in 2014 with 46 action plans and we have tried to work through with different 42 different communities providing them services and introducing recycling and this particular action is part of the 46 action plans proposed with the strategy the initial proximity from oboes transfer station which is within 25 kilometers which was identified as part of the strategy and also the operational hours in the number of days the spread of days seven days a week wasn 't feasible and practical for the overall operation of the West and the management of it we went to the community with undertook the consultation and there wasn 't much support to close the facility down so we have basically struck a balance with the operational needs and overall sustainability and the operation you know the managing the facility and reduce the hours to four days a week and three hours a day so basically with the consultation we follow the follow by survey that was conducted across the Malo residents and to choose the days and the hours of operation the report presents the findings in the analysis in the statistics and recommends that the Malo transfer station be open for four days a week three hours a day on Mondays Fridays Saturdays and Sundays as indicated and you know selected by the community there is opted by the community members so endorsement on this Thanks thank you other questions from counselors do you have a question counselor II know no counselor ease move it can slip out second do you wish to speak counsel raised very briefly we 're grateful at Marla that there 's there is a waste facility there now that we don 't have to drive to or bust we heard that loud and clear that consultation I was at the pub that evening that afternoon when we did do that consultation and it 's clear to see that Marlo the residents omalo are very active early on the weekends and Friday and Monday council Pope 's I 'm just pleased to hear that the officers have had some really good constructive to get a really positive outcome because just to have it closed and them to be expected to drive 25 kilometres ease probably unacceptable and it is isn 't the best outcome they would have liked so I 'm really pleased that the officers have come to a happy medium and the fact that it 's only open for the four days I think that 's locals they don 't have to actually drive 25 kilometres and remember to put their rubbish in the car and I think it 's a win-win so thank you thanks counselor pouts any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you item five point three point three capital works and landfill rehabilitation projects report 2018-19 for the ended 30th June 2019 mr. Sam McPherson thank you madam mayor and councillors councillors the report before you this evening details a summary of the council 's capital works and land fill rehabilitation projects to the financial year ending 30 June 2019 the report also details the capital works changed as a movements for the three-month quarter or the fourth quarter of the 2018-19 financial year for endorsement as well in summary the capital works program for 18 20 18 19 and up totaling 55 point two million dollars which reflected some increases in grant funding that was received during the financial year and also projects which were brought forward for delivery from outlying budgeted years as at the 30th of June 2019 just and landfill rehabilitation on the ground with the further 3.8 million dollars committed or under contract at the end of the financial year so that 's a great news story it 's the first time in a number of years that council has been able to deliver over 30 million dollars within one financial calendar year there are details there of the individual projects but as a high-level summary the the program works included 219 individual projects of which 551 of those have been completed by the end of the financial year with the further 68 either scheduled for a multi-year delivery or being delayed or running behind schedule so councillors there 's a recommendation there for adoption before you happy to take any questions thanks questions councillors counselor tui thanks Sam or just noting here under spins of project budgets of 3.5 million now is that that 's roughly 10% so is that a 10% saving on what we budgeted to spend in some degrees yes but it should also be strongly stressed here and loose Collins will ensure that I make it quite clear that that 's not is a 3.5 million dollar coming in under budget but I 've seen of those projects are externally grant funded so that 's not a return to the council bottom line if I 'm a holding account for very much this thing so some of that 's 3.5 million dollars has gone through the holding account and it 's allowed us to fund additional projects as well so it 's both through the savings in those projects we 've also been able to fund on the extension of projects so my question the reason why I asked that question was that if we can make 10%_``_10043.46 saving I know I 'd be extremely happy if I could save 10% on my budget my home budget so to make it a net saving over the course of a year I think is outstanding and the fact that that money will be invested anyways that 's even better to be honest but that was my question whether that that was actually how it works so there was a saving and we 've spent that on other stuff and counselors I do direct a summary of the the holding count transactions for the 12-month period so counselors are quite easy able to say the income that 's coming or social call it income but the savings that have come in and council cash into the holding account and then where they 've been reallocated into providing additional budget for existing projects or the creation of new projects and also there is the the underlying balance of the holding account as soon 30 and I 'll just remind counsels of that does get returned as a saving to the organization at the end of the financial year and then you financial year that balance starts back at zero any further questions there 's some do I have a mover for the recommendation thanks counselor to e second counsel white thank you do you wish to add anything counsel to e not not much really to add aside from the fact that in the current environment as a sight to find a saving attempt senton is some is a credit to people organizing this work and I 'm really pleased on behalf of their community our buck effectively cancel work thank you madam mayor I would just like to back up what councillor he said because this is a really great outcome considering that we first got on council there was some outcomes that were nowhere near as good as what 's happened now in fact suffering a few good hits so this is great news oh nice but so well done absolutely any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you item five point four point one is the rail freight Alliance campaign was to Syria through you met Amman thank you this item is being brought to Council because it relates to an advocacy campaign which effectively is a political process there is a small amount that is being asked for by the rail freight alliance of which council is a member this request for funds was was sent to all rail freight alliance members as well as all non-member councils across Victoria I think the report is fairly self-explanatory in terms of the purpose of the what they describe as they 're fighting cost I believe it 's appropriate that there 's a council decision on it questions from the councilors thanks counselor Ellis do we have a seconder councillor Buckley councillors do you wish to speak to their motion just simply to mention quietly that this is a really important issue for Gippsland and let 's rail network though the roll likes argument it 's based on the failures of the murray-darling rail network coming into Victoria it also impacts upon the freight rail infrastructure that services Gippsland looking into the future that if our rail infrastructure is not of a secure standard or a superior standard we may suffer in some form into air or our economy may suffer some form as well as in terms of loss of amenity etc this is that worth while fighting fund it 's been addressed to all members of the Victorian rail Alliance which is a local government body it 's putting up a strong argument to ensure that the round networking not only is improved but expands to provide the needed services to our state I commend the recommendation to you thanks counselor rails the better thank you madam me any further speakers I 'm going to speak against it councillors I have a problem with supporting a political politically driven campaign even though the intentions are good the Transport Minister spoke in Parliament last week last Friday actually and reassured Gippsland is that there 's no indication that there 's a threat 20 rail services in fact and the Upper House member John Garrett only reiterated announced the other day 95 million of that new bridge across the Stratford is being expended there I don 't think that there 's a need to buy into a political argument around this any further speakers councillor pouts I just like to say I do believe that there is an area of assumption here the bottom line is I have no qualms with being you know affiliated with the rail alliance because I believe their works excellent and has been consistently improving rail lines across a straight across Victoria and they 've done some really great work the only and and for those who don 't understand the wording that was used in the letter Minister I can understand how they would actually take it in the you know misused manner but I am on behalf of our council I would think that we wouldn 't mean the wording as such to be delivered in in support of what they 're actually saying but the bottom line is to be a member of this alliance I think it 's important for the a skip slanders and for improvements to our rail line as to what was put in the letter the political all wording I don 't believe is relevant to our council because we we wouldn 't actually intend it in that manner further speakers if not right over apply to counsel us I just wanted to assure counsels that the role Alliance is not heading down a political political line it is simply stating a a very strong voice to against a problem that 's existing particularly in the west of the state and where it 's particularly evident the rile Alliance has lobbied and advocated on behalf of improved rail services for for several decades now and in particular more recently under was a counselor and the current chair now we we do have threats in them and we don 't know what 's coming out there we still have the the threat of pack them being the end point for the Gippsland passenger line so to say that we we we cannot be political we really just have to know and advocate whenever any opportunity arises for the betterment of Gippsland rail and and which is not a good place for us to take second place thank you I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against motion is carried seven one item five point four point two drought budget allocation mr. CEO madam mayor thank you this report seeks to for council to consider allocation of the 500,000 that was adopted through the 1920 budget process towards drought response the report outlines what council was seeking in relation to those funds and essentially to paraphrase that looking at having funds that it was able to determine the destiny of the second part or the second point that is worth raising is that council in partnership drought response this these allocations also respond to that document in a positive manner so the report outlines five possible areas for allocations with some indicative amounts to those as well that being individual support community support future focused strategic advocacy and awareness raising and a contingency so essentially counselors as that the report is laid out and the recommendation is before you we 're seeking direction from Council in relation to the allocation of these funds questions counselors counselor pups second counselor to e counsel poets do you wish to speak to their motion I wish would get some rain it 's really hot jerking out there and in the communities and hoping that the spring grass will pop on through and and hearing all the rain that they 're getting down the line and we 're not getting much of it at all and and it is it 's a real concern I really feel for the farmers in that sense and and you know looking into our third year in going into a dry season it 's not at all exciting we feel and this is a part of a solution of what we can actually offer and it 's and if we could offer the rain we 'd give it I 'm sure but the bottom line is this is as much as we can do at this stage Thank You councillor 2e any further speakers I 'll put I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously five point four point three endorsement of the draft marine and coastal policy submission welcome mr. Cole Reynolds and mr. Aaron hello thank you madam mayor and councillors Nicole Reynolds our strategic plan coordinator is here as a co-presenter of this report counselors we 're seeking endorsement by cancel the written East Gippsland Shire Council submission to the draft marine and coastal policy as was proposed as has been proposed by adult jiu-jitsu I 'm constraints they 're in submission as appended at appendix one has been lodged with dealt by the nomine do date of the 15th of August 2019 and counselors have been briefed on this matter so I 'm sure you 're aware of some of the issues but and I don 't want to waste your time but I think there are fundamental issues with this draft policy that will have impacts very x-cube same community by way of summary the fundamental issues are that the draft policy does not recognize appropriately the current East Gippsland local government module as committee management for coastal cran land it aims to over time retracted and decommission building structures and access provisions to private land by withdrawing permission to use coastal crown land it seeks to implement policy objectives which will prohibit buildings and structures on rich lines on rural land between settlements and implement policy which prefers tourism within defined activity notes it does not address adequately funding arrangements for coastal infrastructure and assets particularly for maintenance it does not provide adequate recognition of the economic social and community values associated with the use of and recreation of coastal sediments it proposes unclear decision pathway it provides no guidance with respect to coastal management plans and activities it proposes to implement new zones overlays and buffers relating to coastal crown land with an inadequate level of detail provided it imposes population growth unnecessarily and overriding well considered local strategic planning it proposes a complex marine and spatial planning framework it proposes a table which seeks to remove structures buildings and infrastructure such as private jetties boat sheds access and fishing huts as opportunity arises the opposition not explicitly stated prohibits erosion works and preventative actions which the purpose of benefiting private landowners counselors we believe is Drive policy will fundamentally change the way of life for East Gippsland communities and will have a negative impact on recreational boating and tourism and we hope the Department of Environment land water and planning can amend the policy appropriately and provide counsel in a meaningful consultation process thank you I 've just got some questions can 't_''_10886.029 slip out this is the policy that that was endorsing the the no building or construction work two kilometers out to sea and five kilometers inland from the coastal line this is that one this is a policy will have direct impacts upon development out from the coastal line as you 've indicated and in which five kilometers from a coastal area the submission that the put in is something that isn 't in support of the policy recommendations as such because you feel it 's too onerous and too inhibiting on development within our region and along the coastline of Australia basically correct councillor white yeah thank you well just in in some of these structures they 're talking about will that also include those long term leases of the homes on the on the sandbars that lakes entrance would they be included as you know with those people who lose their right to occupy those holiday homes councillor one of the concerns with this policy is a lack of detail and one of the concerns with this policy is such matters as those structures but it 's also just structures such as jetties both boat houses and even access from Crown land to private land so we 've got a lot of island Islands in our keep saying links that depended upon jetties for access and then access from the crown land to those houses so it 's very concerning further questions councillor Alice you have to move Chancellor Perry I just thought quickly 's attention in relation to this new policy and the impact and I think mr. hollows and Miss Reynolds for endorsing that and doing such a comprehensive study the thing that I 've just lost in relation to Bullock ah and he 's in an action that will be impacted upon that into the future the matters that we were briefed on today and in relation to Jimmy 's point will also be impacted on by the policies of the coming in this this new policy will rebound and it 's a originating act replaces the coastal management act when that will require local government to make application for any development on now at this stage for Shores whether it be crown the crown land all private lands it has a serious planning implication that will seep out as a policy into our own other plans and policies that we as local government are required to do so the strong wording of this policy of this submission is important it 's not trivial we 've already had the opportunity to highlight that to the marine and coastal council when they last and I encourage councillors to become familiar with this policy because it will impact on many of the decisions as we go forward and it could well hold up a lot of development it 's it 's it 's such a seriously it 's not just aimed at both in a Beach checks down in Port Phillip Bay it impacts the whole of the Gippsland lakes as well as the or remote regions of Ayrshire so I encourage counselors to support this this document thank you cancer pups yes I 'll be curious I 've got a question at the end of this but um this is probably the worst bit of work I 've seen in my 12 years or 11 years on council that a policy like this should actually come before us it 's a very difficult policy for any planner to deal with I think our officers have done a substantial job in in spelling out the basics of what this policy means to our community it means any building construction within five kilometers of the of the the waterline cannot be can cannot be be buy back land buybacks as these properties aren 't able to be recognized to their full potential so people that are wondering if they 've got or sitting on land banking properties that have really great views of the ocean they won 't be able to build on them because of this policy if it 's fully implemented by the state government and it means that any construction two kilometres into the water won 't be able to be constructed it 's a very very difficult piece of work it 's equivalent to the inundation overlay and the bushfire overlay in in its restrictions too and if not more in its restrictions to building and development within our potential future community so anyone who is out there and is inclined please feel obliged to writing a submission to the the the committee who 's taking submissions now because this is absolutely the the most important piece of work we 've had to deal with within the last 12 years which has development issues in our community whilst I 've been on council and I mean that very sincerely flip-outs to you all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you item five point four point four endorsement of the regional tourism review submission mr. Stephen clients Thank You Madame an the purpose of this report is to seek Council 's endorsement of the submission to the regional tourism review as proposed by the department of jobs precincts and regions due to the time constraints the written submission was lodged on the nominated due date of the 30th of August 2009 a discussion paper was out was outlined why the reviewers instigated in indicating that regional Victoria is falling behind other states in Australia in terms of the average span by visitors and other key metrics the intention of the review is to look at both traditional tourism functions and high-level advancement of the tourism industry in this at a state level councils written submissions thought and considered feedback from key industry groups in East Gippsland and Gippsland including our own advisory board his Gippsland marketing business and tourism East Gippsland destination Gippsland and we guarded feedback from industry at a workshop held in the 29th of August in summary a number of issues which are rating 22 key questions outlined in the discussion paper some of the key points in our submission were around the fact that up to 85 percent of our land he 's publicly managed and they 're publicly and just play key role one of the recommendations looked at reviewing the role of land matters manager sorry to ensure they have a stronger consideration of tourism opportunities examples being longer term leases on public land and investment to major icons we also consulted with Glowacki who recommended the traditional owners raise awareness of what experience may exist locally and that investment opportunities engaged closely with traditional owners earlier on in product development we also looked at the changing tourism market in Gippsland we looked at key tourism roots and products such as Sydney Melbourne coastal Drive and Greta pond to prioritize its high-end investment into product into the changing visitor market looking at the lack of coordination at a state level we also recommended the development of a statewide regional tourism plan that is based on existing or current destination management plans like it 's is to later on this year thank you are there questions from the councils thanks councillor Roberts the second of councillor what do you wish to speak you know council what any further speakers I 'll just commend you on your work there and your team because obviously it was another large body of work and an important piece of work especially for East Gippsland who realised heavily on tourism for its economic output so thank you I 'll put the motion to you all those in favour a motion is carried unanimously okay item six urgent and other business council of what madam mayor I would just like to move that Ellis be granted permission to raise an item of urgent and how the business relating to a motion of support for the Barry Sheene tribute ride Thank You councillor Buckley do you reached a second thank you I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously none unanimously and the motion is now on the table all of us counselor Ellis to read it out I think so the public concedes to to the short time before the Barry Sheene memorial ride occurs which is at the end 20 27th of October I bring this matter to Council as a matter of business and of some emergency my motion to counsel is that council welcomes all riders in route to the moto gp at Phillip Island on an annual basis working in to working in close cooperation with the Australian Grand Prix corporation the RSL been style and associated local clubs will continue to deliver an enable a successful annual Barry Sheene tribute ride commencing in Bend style and three will work to maximize the economic benefits and opportunities to the region as a whole whilst promoting safe riding my rationale I 'll just refer to my notes just very briefly the Barry Sheene tribute ride has been associated with these Gippsland and the wider Gippsland region since the early 2000s in 2009 the ride was arranged to commence from been stopped this had an immediate economic and societal benefit to the city and the shire as a whole a benefit that continued to grow over the succeeding years unfortunately for the of this loss has been attributed to the lack of commitment not by the many volunteers and businesses to support the ride but by the perceived lack of commitment by Council to address this loss and perhaps a misinterpreted perception the motion has presented an expression of councils wish to address those misconceptions and to ensure the ongoing success of the ride into the future noting that the event is designated as a normal part of the show as economic development teams annual work plan and an early rods recipient funding recipient from Council it is councils continued desire that the ride before most amongst the events the manager economic development promotes and that he or she report on an annual basis to council on the success or otherwise of the ride as was previously his other responsibilities in meeting this desire to of course a good relationship be reignited with such partner groups as the been style RSL to ensure that the success and enjoyment of the riders Staind been style is to the benefit of all councils I commend this recommend this recommendation to you thanks counselor I you wish to speak okay councillor tui thank you madam mayor I I would just like to note that Victoria Police do play a significant role in the Barry Sheene ride and if if possible if we could add that to the Associated local clubs and perhaps mention the Victorian police because they do a lot of work in regards to to this particular event thank you that was easy is it a material change that 's really mad at me I don 't believe that that 's a material change to the to the urgent business is just adding in another organization for clarification I think that 's fine to continue any further speakers counsel why thank you madam mayor um last year I had the honor of waving those bikes off and it was an absolute buzz now somewhere in the process of doing such an act I may have been inadvertently suggested to a young man who was so keen on the bikes and looking at everything there is a he 's a young man with special needs and might have inadvertently suggested that he he may it 's at all possible or achievable by council um we 'd like to I would like to pursue that but please contact me later about the details but it would be he it would be a buzz for this young fellow any further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously now concludes that part of the meeting and we now need to move into camera so I ask that

CEO 3 madam mayor we have apologies from councillor tino and councillor jackson roberts thank you item declarations of conflicts of interest through you madam mayor none have been received thank you I will now ask that mr. Rebecca asked an acting general manager of business excellent giver beef brief background to the purpose of the hearing thank you madam an the proposed local law number one the procedures for council meetings was approved by council on the 25th of June this year for releasing to the community for comments and public submissions in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Act 1989 the proposed local law number 1 documents were made available for review by the public on councils website and at all service and outreach centers on the from the 27th of June 2019 the closing date for public submissions was the fifth of july 2019 7-7 local not law number one with one of those seven being a late submission four of the seventh submitters have indicated they wish to present to the committee at today 's two to three address counselors on the issue they will not be eligible to speak to the item at the council meeting on the 8th of October at which the final decision will be made thank you madam mayor thanks miss Aston we have had four submiss submitters who have advised I wish to address the Committee on their submission so I will ask each submitter in turn to address the committee in respect of their submissions and in doing so advise that they are asked to keep their presentation to no more than five minutes and avoid going over ground that 's already been covered I will now ask mr. Baker others to come forward and speak to her submission I sure thank you Miss Judith Reed would you wish to come forward and speak to the committee [Applause] thank you for that consideration there I was quite upset about the last meeting where all this issue became knowledge and I 'm glad we had the opportunity to speak especially me and this is what I 'd like to say I request time of three minutes to address mayor councillors be extended we weren 't pre advised as you would have known it would be quite an issue as an introduction body and enteral it is most important and to shorten a letter form contents without pre knowledge is not in my opinion open and accountable there any questions from the counselors no thanks miss Wright mrs. Wright please Debbie Carruthers thank you for the opportunity to provide my feedback there are two clauses that I wanted to address into question the first one is clause 1 sorry L 1 point 9 which is definition of acted upon I strongly believe the proposed definition which is in three parts is highly flawed for the following reasons the first part of that definition is has been formally communicated to a person whose interests are materially affected by it this definition is highly ambiguous and will be difficult to enforce or determine how is it possible to know whether a person is materially affected by it is the person to be asked how does one define materially affected is this the same as a conflict of interest which also extends to any family member know if they are materially affected what guarantees are there that the person is not materially affected in addition to these questions a more fundamental one is how does a person being materially affected make any difference in determining if a decision of counsel has been acted upon the second part of that definition in the new amendment is that is proposed is had the effect of commencing a statutory process what does effect mean how is this to be determined and the third part of that definition the new part that is proposed is otherwise practically incapable of being rescinded what does this mean this needs to be defined what are the tests to be applied as to whether practically incapable has been satisfied so in conclusion those three parts which are the parts to form this new definition of acted upon need to be defined and there are definitions there definitions that need to be defined and therefore they 're ambiguous and it makes them highly unsuitable as definitions the commonly accepted definition of acted upon in my view is action was taken to implement the decision as be used the second clause that I would like to comment on is clause 11 I 'm sorry cause L 7.52 request to speak on agenda item and that the proposed clause is each speaker on an item will be allowed between three and five minutes at the chairs discretion firstly it would appear that the mayor had no authority to limit speakers to three minutes as as has occurred at some council meetings this year otherwise why is it considered necessary to make this amendment now secondly under what circumstances would the chair decide whether three or five minutes would apply indeed how does the chair make that decision when a person prepares to speak to an item do they prepare to speak for three or five minutes will people be told this in advance of the council meeting to provide two alternatives will be difficult to administer and will create great uncertainty for those presenting and finally will three minutes become the norm for speakers it is my understanding that in the past no more than five minutes which is the current Clause was applied flexibly based on with this period being extended if deemed appropriate council must remember that hearing from speakers is the opportunity for the community to be heard and to thereby inform council decision-making reducing the speaking time to three minutes reinforces a perception that council makes up its mind behind closed doors regardless of community feedback reducing the time limit to three minutes will do nothing to improve council 's poor performance on a recent report around community consultation and engagement thank you for the opportunity to speak thanks mr. Cruthers councillor pouts the common leaks there is the common leak I believe the commonly accepted definition of acted upon would be action was taken to implement the decision whereas at the moment there are three clauses that are being proposed as a definition for acted upon and my view is that each of those clauses are very ambiguous and that it would be difficult for administering that that definition if those clauses were followed no I don 't but that doesn 't mean that as a community member I 'm not in a position to provide feedback and it 's about looking 're ambiguous and whether they can be counseled the raves yes thanks Dave thanks for that contribution it 's important just in the second point the three or five minutes to get rid of the ambiguity is what you 're really saying you know so that whoever 's speaking can actually prepare and have a really good pitch up it 's either going to be three minutes or five minutes just so you know what it is that 's really what you 're saying and I 'm saying that that needs to be made clearly circumstance for that ahead of time so that when people are filling in the form they know how long it 's going to be but there 's a further point to that that with the three minutes it leaves the impression with the community that the community is being shortened in in a period of time to present and three minutes is a very short period of time so if the council is wanting to fully appreciate the potential inputs that the community can provide to help inform council decision making that the five minutes be lead to administrative difficulties yep good thank you that 's great thank you I think council pouts sorry well as was under clearly what happened here was that councillor Reeves had a question to ask of me about that and I believe that the issues are important enough that that it 's to ensure that there those issues are heard and that there 's an opportunity for councillors to ask any questions about those issues and without having been here today to present that and I feel strong very strongly about both of those issues which is why I 'm here and that I 've spent my time to come here to do that that it 's not exactly worded as my submission was worded but the obviously the points are there but I felt it was important to come and express those here today because I feel very strongly about it any further questions no thanks mr. Cruthers mr. Wynette treasurer I refer to proposed changes to the local law regarding public speaking times and I oppose the time reduction most strongly currently the local law allows five this but the proposed change will allow the chair to reduce speaking time to three minutes with a limit of five minutes for important matters the public needs to bring to the attention of the whole council a live the time limit of three minutes amounts I believe to a parody of engagement as a condition of becoming a councillor all must swear to abide by the Local Government Act which sets our part for role of accounts of sixty-five e facilitate effective communication between the council and the community and set out in the councilor code of conduct as a requirement to office inclusion we will be accessible and active in engaging with our community we will invite listen to and seek to understand the views of others central to the role of councillor is to be the representative of the people not an autocrat a dictator or a rubber-stamp of bureaucracy communication is a two-way process vital to democracy and although in Australia we take it as a given democracy is seriously eroding I remember a time in local government when the monthly full-day council meetings were open in attendance councillors were comfortable relating discussion of the day and opinions of individual councillors were reported to the press people knew what was going on then came amalgamation sold to the public as a more efficient and therefore less costly operation but as its scope expanded and the bureaucracy grew and grew councillors became more and more dependent on their so-called experts now people question we have counselors at all they meet regularly with staff at closed meetings where the real decision-making occurs staff open and respond to mail on their behalf their speeches for functions are written by the propaganda department and public comments from counselors other than the mayor as sell them in the press there is a sense that the public be excluded from early consideration of projects so by the time they are to be finalized it is too late for modification we saw this with the budget public input is an interference and therefore a threat and so the statutory process for required hearings is simply something to be endured not seriously considered and made us brief formal and it 's unwelcoming as possible of its people compared to other councils across the state we are performing badly although in one of the lowest socio-economic areas our rates are set to the max and our councillors cost us amongst the highest we were shown to be the most secretive in the state and now the latest surveys reveal our very low customer service and public engagement records clearly we are not getting good representation for money and that is why people now question why I have counsellors at all I was at that meeting last year when a huge crowd attended concerned about a toxic mine in our clean green environment they had spent hours preparing submissions and travelling long distances but arbitrarily their time was cut from 5 to 3 minutes although the issue has serious implications for East Gippsland future clearly people 's concerns were irrelevant and while councillors spent hours on social activities they would not listen for 5 minutes to the most serious issues of their people I would like to know which councillors supported the proposed time reduction in the local law and I intend standing for the next the propaganda machine as much as you like but the people are increasingly cynical and the latest blow to democracy human respect and genuine interaction it is the council 's new tele screwing over there which ticks away of the seconds of the time a person may speak bought at rate payers expense it epitomizes a new level of arrogant control and dehumanization I don 't know whether you 're old enough to remember but in the 1960s when television was new doctor who came out and I remember the robot Daleks who threatened us to a money machine hundred ninety seconds to speak and then you must desist ten seconds left thank you thank you miss treasure alas key to finish plays thank you are there any questions counselors all right mr. eagleson thank you the plan here it 's to amend the local law meeting procedures well that 's fine most of the pretend amendments I have no problem with however the proposal to give the chair the right to restrict speaking times two three minutes I feel is totally unacceptable and I say this in the context poorly and back that up I 'll have a local government community satisfaction survey coordinated by Dee Welk and these Gippsland sure and when you go through it there 's some very damning things about the this particular sure performance performance is rated significantly lower than similar councils to customer contact performance is ready to seize nearly lower than statewide and large rural group areas average three areas for improvement consultation and engagement in community decisions it is very relevant to what we 're talking about today you know move on to the state sponsored know your council site if we look at transparency here we have nineteen permit for six percent of council decisions made in closed meetings similar councils eight point six six community and common so community satisfaction and community consultation and engagement lower than similar councillors councils but all is not lost cost for councillors we score very highly there he skips they enjoy council fifty two thousand nine hundred and eighty six dollars and fourteen cents per councilor similar councils forty two thousand eight hundred and sixty one dollars that means the ratepayers of East councilor than similar councils now with that context in mind if we move to page one of the local law that we we 're now dealing with you 'll find that it is it says promote and encouragement encourage community participation by providing mechanisms for the council to ascertain the communities of use and expectations now that more than thirty proposed changes to this local ordinance in here which have allowed five minutes it gives a person like myself 10 seconds per an amendment now if in the wisdom of the chair we work up to three minutes it would give us six seconds per amendment now that 's hardly providing mechanisms for the council to ascertain the community 's views and expectations I believe that no mere here the past present or future has the wisdom to decide in advance what knowledge a person is going to bring forward before they have had time to adequately present their case so the restrictive three minutes is denying them procedural fairness if time at council meetings is a problem I would suggest that rather than cut community presentation time to three form which would save at least eight hours per year significantly more than three minutes with that thanks mr. Ellison are there questions from the councils thank you I wanna ask Miss Austen the process following the section two to three committee hearing Thank You Madame there the committee will now formulate recommendations and these will be incorporated into a report to be submitted to the October meeting of Council at which local law one will be considered for adoption with or without amendments thanks miss Aston I 'd like to thank those who submitted and also those who have attended today and who have presented their submissions and I now now declare the hearing closed thank you _"

David Radford manager of communications and corporate strategy thanks madam mayor and good afternoon counselors counselors the Local Government Act requires all councils to prepare and improve a four year council plan following a general election the council plan must include the strategic objectives of Council together four years the council plan must also the council must also review the plan on an annual basis to determine if any adjustments are required and this occurs collaboratively between counselors and staff and of course the community which brings us to today 's process the revision process which commenced earlier this year has included workshops with councilors the executive leadership team and relevant officers having regard for any changes that may have occurred since the original plan was adopted in 2017 the draft revised council plan 2018 21 has been exhibited for public review and comment in accord with section 2 2 3 of the Local Government Act and as per councils resolution of the 7th of May members of the public were advised through multiple communications channels such as newspapers website and social media that the draft revised council plan and the revised draft budget were available for viewing and open for public comment so nine submissions were received against the draft revised council plan although upon inspection officers deemed that the submissions were more aligned to the revised draft budget due to the topics that were covered manager finance and are included to be presented to councillors during the revised draft budget hearing which will follow it should be noted that all submitters received an acknowledgment of their submission and that it would be considered as part of the revised draft budget hearing and not the draft revised council plan there was one submission received throughout this process that officers could could not link with either the draft revised council plan or the revised draft budget officers attempted to contact the individual by telephone on numerous occasions and via email but were unsuccessful and the submitter was asked in writing to make contact with us by the fourth of June and if the response was not received it would therefore be considered that they had taken officer 's advice and chosen to withdraw it from the formal process due to the lack of linkages as the individual didn 't provide a response to the request the submission will not be considered therefore councillors no relevant submissions have been received on the draft revised council plan Thank You mr. Radford and thanks to those who are in the for discussion and deliberation by the committee thank you _"

a lot in regards to the degradation of lions and tigers in South Africa and the effects that it 's having on on the economy over there and just exactly what 's happening with the lion and tiger population worldwide and the decline of that which is down to about five percent of what it was 100 years ago very very interesting thank you thanks counselor Julia council the retainer thank you madam mayor firstly madam may I 'd like to acknowledge that there 's a history making here today with having the first ever Mei mere presiding over an omiai meeting here in Oh me I see gratulations [Applause] that I mean I 've submitted my report but the one item I would like to talk about was our visiting keynote speaker of two weeks business this was a fitting theme for our visiting keynote speaker and many thanks to our East Gippsland Shaw economic development unit for coordinating this year 's speaker Jillian Colby Jillian was visiting and she has set up what 's called the exchange in dubai new south wales Jillian has been described as having the logical thinking of a civil engineer in the roll-ups sleeves of of a farmer 's daughter there was a great crowd on Thursday evening around 130 councillor Reeves and councillor Roberts were also present along with yourself and councillor to you Jillian approaches life optimistically and delivered an inspiring keynote address to this crowd of 130 people Jillian was extremely generous with her time having addressed the East Gippsland secondary students during the afternoon prior to the event and conducting another breakfast follow-up event and then also up here at the annual M&D fundraiser event Jillian 's created a co-working space as a startup incubator in Dubai and I know from the night there 's been a lot of discussions around what could be possible around East Gippsland along similar themes along with these other both national international business from her regional New South Wales home base Jillian commenced a business called the infrastructure collaborative this collaborative works hard to create thriving regional communities by shifting regional infrastructure priorities from planning shelves to be shovel-ready through being able to advocate on a united front whenever they approach either level of government the infrastructure collaborative refocuses infrastructure conversations around the benefits to the community productivity for agriculture safe and secure water supplies or access across regions it was a great networking night which has inspired many within our region hopefully this type of event can become part of our annual economic development calendar thank you madam mayor thanks councillor retainer councillor Reeves yeah hear hear Council retain oh thanks for that I also attended that presentation by Jillian kilby and it was spectacular but ladies and gentlemen I wanted to just note in particular the citizenship ceremony this month and these are always fabulous events and a real celebration of the realisation of becoming an Australian citizen and it 's difficult to imagine ladies and gentlemen in our safe and privileged as country that this is 's a second year we have taken the council meetings to the community these have a price but hopefully you who are here see the value why do I say this well there 's been negative press around the expense of operating a shire her counselor recently compared with and usually compared with small and very different settings and shires ours is the second biggest Shire in the state and I wish I received the figure quoted as the councillor expense something like 54,000 or something I think we were being paid that was what was listed in the press far from that ladies and gentlemen far from it we just don 't receive that as is a huge shire the value of democracy engagement and community participation is only a apparent when one compares this with the cost to country 's people and communities who don 't have it citizenship ceremonies being here at omiyo and meeting our good locals are a reminder of the investment not the cost of good governance thank you well said councillor Reeves councillor Buckley I don 't think you met at me briefly of my friend Parker and he had a lot of other friends as well in a crash up in Fiji Yoga Parker he was one of these blokes who could turn his hand to anything except perhaps to mix domestic bliss and was a great supporter of local things particularly sports I remember once we were very sort of footballers and this fella hadn 't played any competition football before and he acquitted himself extremely well and you know he was a great fellow around this district and he 'd been operating out of New Guinea for a little while and establishing a quite a business there so anyway I 'm very sorry to have to report that because many of you would have known him quite well okay thank you thank you madam a councillor Buckley counselor Ellis I think you made a merit I 'll follow the trend of reports today and to say that I 've prepared a written report and relations or the number of meetings that I 've attended over the past month I 'll just draw counsels attention to a couple teams one is Paintsville Maritime Museum mr. Rob was a real driving force in any counselor that cummock had been confronted by Rob would know he 's his passion for that particular museum its activities and of course he was also the author of the most informative newsletter among the history of the maritime activities at Paintsville would like to express my sincere condolences to mr. Cook 's wife Jane and their family and friends just gonna touch on something it 's impacted me and others just more recently and I don 't want to go too far into it because it blurs the lines of government and that daddy you know you know which is Council has been accused of this across the industry including in the herald-sun just recently where we step outside the third tier of government and going to matter self the second tier but having attended yet another funeral yesterday of a young man who died in unexpected circumstances I consider that we should as a community start to look at what we have in our community to help young men and an ethical all men all members and I encourage members of the State Parliament on the other side of government to address that and particularly here in East Gippsland and where we have very poor so a limited amount of service I shouldn 't say the word Paul and I I really would like to emphasize that for all of us as caring members of the community to look to these province and to address them I 'll leave that those words at that thank you thanks counselor Ellis council what thank you madam mayor and councillors I 'd just like to mention a few of the things that been involved in this last month still because of the drought I have a quite a big involvement now in in these committees and subcommittees which have met again because we are not we are certainly not through this drought at this stage so just to let people know that the council is still actively involved in trying to find solutions and a way through this for all of our communities we also had our quarterly Audit Committee meeting which I attended and perhaps a highlight for held in Ballarat weekend before last in that have to congratulate them on the quality of that workshop and the and the absolute quality of the guest speakers that they had and the subjects which were incredibly current you know right in our face things like the the problems in waste management and recycling that 's affecting a lot of councils and the fact that right now we unfortunately are seen a large quantity of what should be recycled going into landfills particularly for the suburban councils because they do not have a landfill facility so then they have to try and fall in space where somebody has a hole in the ground and it 's not an ideal situation at all there was also one very topical was a guest speaker who spoke on and his was involved in some of these recent council dismissals and he just went through the process to to explain to us what had happened and why and what the outcomes were so and of course the most recent one being South Gippsland and then something else that 's probably relevant not only to guest speaker who spoke on bullying and toxic behavior within work workplaces and he was we good and lucky he really did he to hit a nerve and had got great applause at the end of it because I could see around the room that he engaged everybody there because they possibly all had something in the back of their mind that they they related to this so that was just as I said it was a extremely informative weekend and I did enjoy participating so thank you very much thanks counsel white counts the pelts thank you madam me first of all I 'd like to reflect on I recently had was fortunate enough to have a trip overseas and ended up here unexpectedly in Washington DC and what I wanted to share with you was some of the innovative the innovative tourists things that are happening over there and to my delight I saw uber ebikes and uber scooters being lying all over the the pavements and things in the city area so within the CBD there was this new innovative usage of an e scooter and quite at the front of their offices and they would travel down their streets delivered documents and get back on and travel back up the street again to their office they paid a dollar twenty-five for the original usage and then five cents a minute after that so it was a very cost-effective cheap mechanism of of transport instead of having to wait for a cab or to walk or to catch a bus of some sort it was instant and it was very effective and I thought um I was curious as to how this might be used in our community it was not only the businesses using it but was also the tourists and the tourists were mainly people of maybe in their early 30s that would have young children they 're traveling around or anyone that 's used a scooter or a a skateboard or something of that type whilst they were growing up and they were very useful they had a throttle and a brake and you just stood on it and and went it was all a operated and you just picked it up at the it on the sidewalk and somebody else came along and used it after you so I was curious as to how long it would take for our community to utilize this but I thought it was a very effective useful tool of a providing transport in a business community but also to the tourist market which I found a bit exciting so and I wanted to share that with you but one other thing that we as a council group have have requested to the man we 've asked her to to follow up from the recent Current Affair program in regards to the been style Secondary College that aired on the 22nd of July this year and we will we 've asked them the mayor to write to the Minister of Education the Honorable James Molino MP and have requested that he takes some consideration with regards to the damage that 's been done to our community with regards to the programs airing whilst council would normally not commit comment on school operation matters the councillors were appalled at the representation of this school and how the impact how this does little to address issues raised in our community this kind of negative press simply highlights many of the challenges facing rural and regional communities and we thought it was a great opportunity to welcome Lee warmly invite the minister to come down and come and see for himself and to help mend this community from the damage that 's been done by the current affair program and we 'd strongly ask him to come and meet with the students the families and the teachers and to send a strong message from the andrews state government the commitment of the work and the school improvement programs that the Labour government has committed to we know that they 've committed to the funding of the stage two of the redevelopment of the Secondary College and we 'd like this to be doors by his representation in our community so we 've asked our mare to on behalf of our council to send the invitation out to the minister and to help our community men from what 's the damage that 's been caused thank you madam me thanks counselor pelts touch on over the last month I was pleased to officially open the new Gippsland solar showroom in Burns Dale which you know despite the challenging times that some businesses are going through at the moment it 's great to see a small business establish itself and see the prospects that East Gippsland have and they are employing six full time staff including one apprentice so that 's a great news story for our region on that same day I was also able to officially open the new and improved upgrade of the bends Dale Aquatic Center which was a six and a half million dollar project co-funded by the state government and carried out by local contractor broker builders and it 's an absolute credit to them and their Shire for completing a significant project and you know during that time membership numbers also increased for the pools so and since the new and improved facilities have gone in the number of people visiting the pool has been incredible so it 's a great asset for our area and lastly I just wanted to talk about the fifth annual MMD we have a local resident here who 's been suffering from remedy for a number of years and it 's always a great event to support that resident and over 100 people were fortunate enough to hear from a range of guest speakers including former AFL greats current AFL women 's player and also Jillian Kilby and two and a half thousand dollars was raised through the option which will be donated to omiyo district health and so moving on to our officer reports now 5.1.1 is the report on audit and risk meaning held on the 23rd of july 2019 mr. Paston Thank You Madame mayor this is a report that comes to council on a quarterly basis following each audit and Risk Committee meeting as Madame mayor said this is for the audit and Risk Committee that was held on the 23rd of July it outlines just an overview of the issues that were discussed and the recommendation to councillors is obviously to note the report and the issues that were tabled and discussed at the meeting thank you thanks miss Aston are there any questions from a question madam ear but more a statement and it relates to the vago report tabled may 20 19 which has been referred to our audit risk committee to you know challenge and check our protocols and ensure that we 're doing everything we can in relation to some of the issues raised in that vago report but interestingly whilst you know there was no significant fraudulent activity identified through that report I believe that some of the activities are not representative of the modern workplace protocols or behaviors and probably certainly making some of those points when it comes back to us thank you thanks councillor Tino any further questions or comments from the councillors no we have a recommendation before you I think this councilor routine oh thanks counselor Reeves all those in favor motion is carried yeah item 5.1 point to review of council policies the risk management policy miss Aston thank you madam mayor the risk management policy is normally reviewed by councillors once a year it was last reviewed in September 2018 its proposed through this report that the policy be reviewed every three years administrative changes to it it was reviewed by the order and Risk Committee at its meeting on the 20th of April 2019 and the recommendation is before you councillors thanks miss Aston are there any questions council race thanks man miss Aston just can you remind us while we 're moving to three-year reviews rather than one year reviews please absolutely last year we reviewed well counsel has reviewed the OHS policy and that was a policy that was reviewed annually and it was recommended at that time due to the the lack of changes that occur each year to that policy that had be changed to three years which we did and it was also mooted at that meeting that the same happened with the risk management policy it 's anticipated that there 's going to be no loss of efficacy and without consistency that 's been demonstrated in counsels position on risk management and also the legislation each year hence the reason that a three year of you instead of annual be proposed councillor pulps if I may miss Aston is can you just clarify whether that 's our duty of care yes that has been reviewed and checked councillor palsun that is in line with legislation and also what other councils are doing and that 's not to say that if there 's any changes that occur within those three years that the policy can 't_''_1742.15 be updated either no further questions councillor Pelt 's happy to move counselor Reeves second all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you five point one point three investment policy review 2019 miss Aston thank you madam mayor this the investment policy is a key financial management document that provides clear directives for the investment of surplus cash while also minimizing risk to council through any investment decisions made this has been reviewed by our manager finance it 's reviewed annually to ensure that it continues to reflect industry best practice and counselors approach to risk it 's recommended in this report that the review is changed from annual to biannual the review that 's been conducted this year there was only one minor amendment that was identified under the investment in locally based financial institutions section with an reviewed this revised policy at its meeting held on 23rd of July and the recommendation is before you thanks miss Aston are there any questions counselor Reeves thanks miss Aston can you just also remind us about how our investment policy policy might support local communities Thank You councillor Reeves um I haven 't_''_1838.12 I 'm not fully across the detail of that one so potentially mr. CEO through you madam chair the the council and part of this policy does allow for council to invest in local community banks for example particularly where they 're on a start up a process so there is a there is a mechanism within the investment there are quite strict rules governing how councils invest their money but within its policy framework it does allow for example support for some local banks such as community banks and again for example at mallacoota thanks Mia it 's good to have that on the record thank you thanks council race there 's no further questions there 's a recommendation before you do we have a thanks counselor Pelt 's second off thanks counselor tewi all adoption of the draft eagle point structure plan miss Reynolds mmm good afternoon madam mayor councillors mr.

CEO or our director of governance miss Bennett can you please refrain from calling from calling out madam Mara I would take the contrary thank you me spent so as I have previously stated presentations will go no more than five minutes and I 'll now ask mr. Chris Nixon who is the farmers voice or boss branch vff to come forward and make his submission his okay we can hold off till the end to see if he arrives RM treasurer if you would like to come and present to the committee right I appreciate being able to address the council in regards to the council 's working future plans and budgets I trust to have your full and undivided attention as I am NOT an eloquent speaker it is important that you concentrate on my principles rather than the data in my submission I did tick on the online submission I did take both boxes to speak to the 21 and the 1919-20 what whatever categories they called right counsel needs to cut your garment to your cloth translate this as correctly understand ratepayers situation of drought the economic flow on of farmers lack of spending to the business sector decreased interest markedly or freeze the rates to all and also cut by 50% the rates to farmers it appears there is a profit or a surplus in the budget so a reduction can be afforded for example this agricultural seasonal downturn has an impact on cattle breeding herds for a minimum of five years and will continue to impact for possibly another five years before livestock numbers can return to capacity so the economics are tenuous for a long time for a lot of ratepayers it is not possible from the draft information to understand where dollars should be excised as detail is missing I do think that many projects outside state statutory obligations need to be axed user play pays should be arranged only however if management improves markedly so costs are enormous Lee decreased please note that the live stock exchange seems to be a user pays profit rehna revenue should should not go into general revenue this will show how much the exchange makes in profit management needs to devise a way to decrease user pays costs extensive money as depreciation physically or needs to be put aside account with the rate system strenuous continued consideration and a move to change to house and curtilage for rating is paramount it gives greater equity of rate costs the housing sector is increasing in high numbers basic use of a calculator or pen and paper and start from the position how much money is there from the rate payers and with the rate freeze or 50 bit and 50 percent reduction and the harson curtilage system then decide what can be afforded this needs to be the culture and shift in attitude of staff and whoever present items to counsel the assumption rates need to continuously increase is not my mode of thinking shift to council will do better delivery and financial management be more efficient on less and be more responsible with the taxpayers rate of money importantly council cannot be all things to all people thank you thank you Miss treasurer are there any questions from the councillors charging in rates there can be an explanation to the public as to how these surpluses come about and what it 's put aside for and as to why there in the memo you know operating capital grant income operating accounts so council has you know a 35 plus million capital program and that 's funded partly from those government grant from council cash and and other contributions so in terms of what 's in our surplus there is significant funding towards the capital works program we need to make a surplus as you referred to when we 're talking about the cash and we look at the cash flow statement how did that is about ensuring we have cash readily available to meet our short-term commitments in terms of employee costs and other payables and year-end as well so the statements do explain that if you read through that and the notes within the budget thank you thanks mr. treasurer oh now this is not no thank you I 'll now ask Janice Coates to come and speak first of all I 'd like to apologize for the brevity of my written submission which was a one-liner saying that I wanted to mention my objection to what our rate increases are and that I would submit submit a verbal fact that being very busy trying to keep the farm going under drought conditions I had limited time to get all this together however what I have done I 've prepared a summary of the right situation for our particular farm enterprise to support the evidence that the rate increases have been I believe unfair for a number of years so what I 'll do enough of only got ten of these to go around so somewhat have to share one between two but I haven 't actually put the actual rate amounts on this submission but what I have done is shown for a number of years what the rate increase in dollar terms was for the four different titles that comprise our farm enterprise that we run and I 'll explain that for property everyone 's got a copy of that yet to look at but in 2018 property two and three actually had a decrease in the rates and that was due to me putting in an objection to the objection to the evaluation that occurred the revaluation that occurred at that time which showed a significant up the totals of all that you can work that out for yourselves you 'll see the municipal charge has been set out in that right-hand column and it 's a bit all over the place I think some of the reasons for the big increase there was that waste management was included in that charge in 2015 at the time but you would know more about that myself and might correct me on that however going down to the percentage rate increase which is the second table at the bottom which really paints the picture of what I 'm talking about today that over a number of years that rate increase from 2012 to 2013 was put at 4% which I think that year the council had a policy that everything had be a straight four percent increase now the following year you 'll see that the rate increase there was nothing under 10% increase it went from between ten and twelve point four percent increase the following year once again there was a overall increase for the rates and in 2016 once again it was a bit all once again I think that was due to the council deciding on a blanket rate increase for that year 2018 as I said the property two and three actually had a decrease because of the objection that I put into the revaluation that year but the one property had an increase of thirteen point two six percent on it in that year now when I read in the paper that we have got certain rate increases occurring with the Shire when I look at my rates when I get them it doesn 't tell me at all with it 's been put in the paper and I wonder why this discrepancy occurs now I averaged out all those property rate increases and then I averaged the averages and got four point six four percent increase over that eight-year period and when I compared that to the rate of inflation for Australia at one point nine three percent I wonder why over all those years we are seeing more than double probably two and a quarter times more than the rate of inflation for the way our rates go up so done about this thanks mr. Coates are there any questions from the counselors thank you mr. John Dalton okay mr. diamond eagleson thank you okay first I 'd like to start by saying I strongly disagree with what your ruling on the five minutes I think it 's completely out of order the to section two to three hearings should not be confused with the local law that covers council meetings this is not a council meeting it 's a hearing of submissions and to cut it to five minutes it 's totally out of order and I 'm most disappointed yeah lovely council plan talks about vision for his Gippsland we will be accessible and active in engaging with our community we will invite listen and seek to understand the views of others proactively share information about council 's plans projects service and then now to cover the submission to five minutes on a huge document like the budget he 's absolutely in contrast of you planned vision for East Gippsland I 'd say this has not a good budget at all the despite two pages of rhetoric in the council plan talks of wonderful things like and has lovely statements like building strong vibrant communities enriching lifestyle dynamic and through and thriving economies in the council plan I don 't see any mention of the word rate payer I see the council plan is and I planned the screw as much out of ratepayers as I possibly can over the next three years it lists the 2.5 percent rise planned every year now when you add that to the increasing number of properties being rated it actually works out to be an eight point six percent increase in revenue for the Shire and that 's until the end of the planned and a very cozy little setup for selected tenders and staff it 's the time the council has started to do what they 're elected to do let 's represent the ratepayers represent the ratepayers not the shy on the staff its represent the ratepayers and I support the suggestion that 's going around that there should be no rises in the rates for this year and a 50% cut for farmers rates this is not any in the gross overcharging that has been done in the past if the show was run with an interest of the ratepayers this could be done without could be a much greater reduction this free suggestion and cut can easily be achieved by cutting back on some of the extravagances nor do we need the large surplus these cuts could be easily achieved for many years I was a commercial building with many years experience in that so at a quick look at some of the figures in the council planned expenses 50,000 to design a toilet block herb and Porter bends down twenty thousand dollars to design a mallacoota for short all o 'clock thirty thousand dollars to design and amenities block that 's a hundred thousand dollars just there surely to goodness we can go to the plan draw and pull out some plans of a taller block it 's a hundred thousand per cell and saved straightaway you have a building surveyor on staff surely he 'd be capable of pioneer plan of a toilet block surely we don 't have to reinvent the wheel every time ya you gotta actually build the toilet block two hundred and forty thousand dollars for one two hundred and fifty thousand you 've got to be joking another item like relocate their toilet block at Eagle Point five hundred and fifty thousand what 's going on I demolish the existing toilet and build two McMansions for five hundred and fifty thousand it 's a joke and we 're supposed to just back and think it 's wonderful and we 'd only get five minutes to come into them I get further on the economic development service and what they claim they 're going to do that segundus service the economic development and assist the organization facilitate an environment that is conducive to a sustainable and growing local business sector and provide opportunities for local residents to improve their skills and excessive Limon we 're going to give them one point four nine six million dollars to do that surely to goodness we 're setting up in the opposition to TAFE or something it 's not this councils responsibility to train people and in in jobs we don 't have the not ratepayers responsibility to do this we pay taxes the federal and state governments to do that not the council can you please conclude mistake soon I 've got a little bit yeah can you just play the next one all that is there all that is going to do is going to drive businesses out of the area who 'd come to an area where they going to be rated out of the place through higher taxes because they 're going to be paying it of all taxes all the time now legal expenses I see there 's an item at 400,000 surely we 're not paying to persecute another councillor a lot of the may that went into the last legal bill was just persecuting one councillor anyways conclude we do some writing half the new local newspaper with all the propaganda releases and it could go on but you 've obviously won 't give me a chance but I could listen about it doesn 't more things that it 's just ridiculous if you even consider thank you are there any questions from the councillors we have can you please come and present at the outset of my presentation I 'd like to acknowledge that the CIO mister Bashford is new to the position and he has inherited the culture and processes which are now under close scrutiny he did not create the processes which have developed over the past 15 years but clearly he will be a creep higher if genuine changes to take place these gifts then Shire is moving towards a crisis point I don 't say that lightly for a number of years public concern has been growing over escalating rates closed processes and extravagant spending East Gippsland is one of the poorest areas in the state with the median household income of 37,000 being 10,000 less than the Australian median and yet this Shire among is among those with the highest rates on a par with some of Melbourne wealthiest areas over the past 10 years compounding rates have region risen far beyond rises in wages and prices with farm rates in East Gippsland among the highest in the state what has developed cannot be sustained the culture that has developed serves that blocks genuine interaction with the public and I think we 've seen that today if we can 't listen for a few more minutes to a very very serious issue that underlines everything we do we 're in a very sad state there are regular closed briefing sessions where councils are expected to reach consensus notices of motion put up by councillors to bring matters in to the public a few as they are frowned upon as being bad team playing like broadsiding your colleagues quote councillors are kept busy with social attendances so they perceive when they come in to be councillors that Rolle is a sort of vice-regal one calm eight culminating every month in a primary schools like show-and-tell display for the public the real work of counselors has been largely abdicated through increased powers of delegation and a lack of questioning of information given in the briefing sessions there is a very clear need for all counselors to be familiar with the Local Government Act and other relevant acts even their own local laws and meeting procedures briefing sessions need to be open to the thoroughly track budget read trajectories two of the most important roles of a counselor the sixth election of a CEO and the approval and working of the budget not blindly but after careful consideration and questioning what has grown up over the past 15 years is a culture of compliance to the administration after the hype of elections for councillors to represent us the candidates cross the drawbridge to corporate fortress and almost immediately swap allegiance continually they are told they must be team players but they are no longer leaders of the ratepayer team they have become the corporate team isolated from their constituents last election due to the dissatisfaction with the Shara record thirty nine candidates stood with the two most touted issues being the needed for greater transparency and lower rates last year three councilors moved unsuccessfully for a rate freeze and were publicly chastised by the others but on the other major issue processes have remained closed at the rate set at the highest allowed by the government there is a groundswell of opinion that the Shire is living beyond its means with senior staff on and litigation slack compliance processes with questionable tender processes ridiculously high capital works projects needing a more common-sense approach waste on Interstate trips with councillors taking along staff miners to steer their thinking serious questions have been circulating throughout this Shire now for you denying just a few the Reimann doll and fairy bastian point works the waste management facility the tower landing a stake Matheson 's road subdivision and the expenditure at benamber in terms of lease to benefit a mining company there is a need for overall independent review of the operations program staff numbers and improved compliance protocols of the East Gippsland Shire this should include significant reduction in staff numbers particularly in the area of governance and public relations the local paper should write its own articles to include sheriff activities people are not duped by continuous hype and they are aware when speeches and quotes have been concocted by the PR department it would improve the council 's credibility if councillors opened and responded their own mail and if they spoke with their own voices on variant issues there is a need to rationalize workspace between ordinary meetings if they had other smaller meetings we have now downstairs great big room under utilized as per under utilization customer services in service street very much underused underutilized but it 's costly to maintain why not sell it and put the money to better use overall the message is for more sensible responsible and frugal operations a reduction in staff and flicked vehicles the rates this year should be frozen and farmer 's rates cut by 50% this could easily be done from the surplus of thirteen point eight million as well as the profits from out of the farmers at the livestock exchange which is probably in the order of something like a million dollars I wish our new CEO well he will need integrity conviction and courage for the massive job ahead east gippsland has been teetering for a number of years on the breack of a major inquiry i 've heard that now about six times from different groups of people and it 'll come to a head I assure you can round swell as we conclude miss treasurer the groundswell is rising the thank you are there any questions from the counselors thanks have you read the budget have you studied it Thank You mr. Joe Thank You mr. ken white afternoon all I just wanted to make a brief submission to the I mean regards to the upcoming budget for what it 's worth a few observations so whilst these plans are capping rates at the at the rate increase of the mandatory rate cap the timing for the implementation of rates valuation increases couldn 't be much worse given the state of play with drought and reduced stock numbers for many East Gippsland farmers the release of the budget probably in its first instance showed the lack of respect empathy and how in touch these Gippsland Shire is with its ratepayers and in particular its farming community I 've mapped out the increase in rate revenue and increase in total wages and remuneration to staff over the past 15 years and it tells a compelling story since 2004 in general rate revenue has increased approximately 170 plus percent from 21 million in 2004 to 58 million last year wages have increased million in 2004 to 28 million last year what does this tell the average rate payer that most that most of the rate revenue 62 percent of the increase in rate revenue over that period doesn 't actually hit the ground in capital works and maintenance much of it is lost in wages in in the officers I realize I 'm generalizing here in that some of those wages would be frontline wages and there are some wages that are funded by capital grants not rate revenue however these are compelling numbers and if the show I really wanted to be transparent with its bigger stakeholders it should open up and tell exactly where the money money goes not just give us a pretty little pie chart not our rates bill further on the debate of rates I personally have no objection to paying rates bearing in mind the terrible timing for the increase as stated above just like paying taxes however my biggest gripe is the lack of accountability on where rate revenue was spent has stated above much of it has been spent on wages which I 'll this much of the rest of it is spent on capital works and maintenance the shire has had some epic fails on accountability and maintenance and capital works in recent years I believe and I 'm happy to be proven incorrect that under previous leadership the shire as I 'd complete disdain for accountability and anyone including myself who wanted to bring them to account a few examples of this include a having exclusive supply agreement with a roads maintenance contractor for the provision of road materials without a contract and without a tender for over six years be approving a budget and project for the redevelopment of Pike Street offices for the show without carrying out an asbestos audit which resulted in a project overrun and the tune of 600,000 on this particular job to cover tracks the show I simply changed their council approved budget figure in its tracking of its capital works program so when it reaches which is the end of the project it magically meets budget C repairing the Ryman Island ferry on a council approved budget figure of around 1.2 million only for this the space of four months and that and that particular job bought about a separate that took an independent independent accounting firm to look into that one and tell us tell the Ayrshire that we dumped the wrong thing and if you read a couple of lines out of this summary of the findings this is a Crowe Horwath report into that particular job summary of the findings overall we found that the procurement undertaken was not compliant with the council 's funding legislative or policy obligations secondly the procurement and financial controls in place we 're not adhered to and there was insufficient oversight an account of expenditure related to those works so we have systems and controls in place we just we just don 't adhere to them at all D Street beautification projects for the bends Dale CVD that were stuck through councillors with little oversight and then will only cause greater retail stress than many businesses are already suffering I see a shop across the road from my office clay put up with a closing sign on it just just in the last week apparently stakeholders apart from a two-page survey where I made a clear car parks were already at a premium we rely on some consultants report from Melbourne to tell us that we have adequate long-term car parks in Delmore Street so we can get rid of a few dozen in and around Safeway of all places so we 'll see some more retailers closing in the next 12 to 24 months this is not just a result of size of size actions I get there 's other issues but there but the size actions are not really helping now I 've got plenty more where that came from basically within the show there 's a culture that you guys know best and we all know nothing consultations only done so you can tick a box and say that it 's done I I don 't believe it 's genuine the Shire has an audit committee so the public are told and the public would think that by its very name it 's more than just a tick and flick oversight capacity that 's not the case this committee has no capacity to on panel beat and information fed to them by staff who will work to protect their own positions within the organisation this business does not like all want transparency when its biggest stake holders of the mania if the scheie was genuinely keen on transparency and accountability it would give the Audit Committee more power get properly qualified people on it and pay them for their time to give the public confidence in the service the cut and thrust of my argument is that the show is that the if this show I can demonstrate its delivering genuine value for rates instead of debacles like the ones I 've just talked about then the arguments about rate revenue itself does not do not have anywhere near as much clout waste money which is what 's happened in recent years and it 's no surprise you 're facing the opposition that you have on these issues thanks mr. Wyatt are there any questions from the councils councillor pouts you know just in regards to the point that and I 'm curious as to how that 's come about only and I we do have base guidelines so different offices if someone 's taking up the role and they 're being paid for a job it easy within a guideline and counsel has to pay within that guideline for it to be fulfilled and I 'm just curious for the public to understand how those increases come about during the time period response council made a decision to bring the parks and gardens services back in-house previously that had been provided by contract and so that was significant increase in terms of employee costs related to bringing that service back in-house and there was obviously a reduction in contractor costs but in reading the information in the financial statements you 'd probably really need to read all of the information because at the same time we 're also undertaking the Tambo Bluff private scheme works so there was a obviously increased income and expenditure through that period for that project as well not necessarily employee costs but in terms of the offsetting yes there was a plus for employee costs but there was a reduction in external materials and contractor cost significant Brewster Lee likes entrance action and Development Association okay please take a seat Warren so I 'm Lauren the treasurer for leader so the 2019 20 draft budget seems to indicate that funds promise for Lakes Entrance for use by 2019 for improvements to the foreshore and Esplanade whom now not be available until much later the majority in 2223 so it 's important to put the situation of lakes entrance into perspective we have 25 retail sites in town which are now closed the place looks half deserted with broken footpaths in the CBD buildings that have been vacant for years and key sites such as the slipway and Bullock Island remain in an eyesore there appears to be little incentive for investors to contribute to the town in its current state in short the situation needs to be addressed promptly promptly lakes is hurting and we need the council 's help after the most accessible Town Meeting to date with over 320 people in attendance and over 100 survey is completed the town priorities for lakes have cemented what we already knew Bullock Island the foreshore and Esplanade Island Eyre items on the town 's people 's agenda leader in the community welcomed the allocation of funds for the Jimmy 's point lookout and we are happy to do our part in bringing life back into the town but we also need the East Gippsland Shire to do their part to back on March 8th leader met with the federal Member for Lakes Entrance Darren Chester and the East Gippsland Shire at this time we all agreed that Lakes Entrance needed an overarching plan along with a vision and marketing plan to attract investors into the town after reviewing the draft budget we note that no funds have been allocated to develop these plans therefore we do request an allocation to be made for development of these plans in the 2019 20 budget back in 2016 previous council and management told us it 's now Lakes Entrance turn however we 're only just beginning to see its progress an allocation of funds to these plans would be a win for the Shire as it shows the people of Lake sanctions that it really is our turn it goes to streetscape in 2122 leader also requests a budget commitment of a hundred thousand in 2019 20 and request the extra funding restore sought from state and federal government for improvement to the four Lakes Entrance walks leader has been in talks with the Shire for over a year regarding the walks and has also been promised an audit of the walks to address maintenance of the tracks along with improvements such as directional signage however despite documented commitment there has been no budget allocation made for these important and significant walks Bullock Island so Bullock island has been on the agenda for over 30 years we know it 's not yet been finalized however our understanding is that East Gippsland Shire will become responsible apart from the sea walls the Bullock island master plan was adopted by the council back in 2015 and our concern is that there 's no budget allocation for development of Bullock Island despite aspects of its development being low cost and a high priority with immediate benefits for residents and tourists the budget document is a planning document so there 's no reason why _''_2878.25 are perhaps subject to the finalization of management arrangements these are indicative figures but leader requests a budget allocation of 1.5 3 million being made up as follows 30,000 in 2019 22 update the master plan this could be done in-house or with a consultant but either way it needs to be done in conjunction with leader the rest of the 1.53 million would be as follows 500,000 for stage 1 in 20 2021 500,000 for stage 2 in 21 22 and another 500,000 for stage 3 in 22 23 as I said these are indicative figures and once we 've refined and updated the master plan we would then have a more accurate idea of staging budget allocation and grants available leader appreciates the now regular me meetings with CEO and the mayor and appreciates that money has recently been allocated to Jimmy 's point lookout and to the works being undertaken along the foreshore it 's an important start to rejuvenating the town however much more is needed to address the backlog of much-needed infrastructure so Lakes Entrance is the number one destination in East Gippsland for holidays I 've just outlined for the development of Lakes Entrance it 's imperative for the survival of Lakes Entrance that these allocations be made to the budget thanks miss Barlow are there any questions councillor attend a question for the CEO could you please clarify counsels position on Bullock Island three three Oh madam mayor so I think it 's been widely discussed that we are not currently the land managers of Bullock Island Council has been in discussions with dope for a considerable period of time and are hoping to come up with an arrangement but it 's certainly not a fait accompli in terms of whether we will take over the land manager of the island the council have made it very clear to myself and other officers that they are concerned about the ongoing legacy issues of some of the infrastructure in there and you mentioned the other sea walls in particular and that certainly is a concern for us as it is a legacy issue across the Shire that we are dealing with so at this point in time council doesn 't have a formal position it will be the subject of a further report to Council for decision thanks councillor pouts if I may just with regards to expenditure in the Lakes Entrance for sure I 'm curious as to how much commitment we 've actually put into the the foreshore streetscape and also how much big bribes is put in as to total expenditure of what 's being spent in that town at the moment mr. my first interior wish to answer yes thank you madam mayor and council the pals for your question I can comment on the the funding that 's allocated in the four-year capital works program and unfortunately moment council pals I don 't have the Vic roads or regional roads of Toria contribution with me or in front of me in able to supply that figure looking at the projected four-year a forecast of the capital works budget I 'm just doing a quick calculation my head across the four years is 1.8 million allocated to Lakes Entrance straight cuts Street scapes at various stages across multiple years and then an additional allocation of 717 any further questions councils you are the last but that disappoints me deeply what I 've heard today is some very profound observations made by ratepayers and you talk a lot in your material about listening to the community and understanding what 's going on you 've had here several people who have made I think the first class observations and I think the notion of cutting them short is incredible we are a democracy and when you close down discussions like that that itself is a huge worry to me huge worry it says something and I think you should be more sensitive to that it also describes that you look showers clear to be process driven you 've decided that you must only go outside them at five minutes and that 's it so you 're not worried about outcomes you waited that process now a couple of people have spoken here have made some incredible observations that I would have thought counselors should have followed up on and explored further because in my view you would have learned more from that from a lot of other things certainly from stuff that 't heard from some of these people before I wrote my material otherwise it would have been quite different what we have to remember is that I know you are a creature of the state I know you 've got a local contact but we must consider democracy we must consider freedom of speech we must consider the freedom of the individual to be able to have their say and but what you 've done today is contra to that now this has been a very steam process as far as I 'm concerned I 've had I 'm a relative outsider and I 've had some incredible feedback that 's coming through to me and I think read a tipping point in two ways first of all we 've got a new CEO and I think that offers a huge opportunity to do something about the sad situation we 're in but my sense is that if you don 't take advantage the situation the new CEO and a relatively new mayor we 're going to be in serious trouble if I were government I would seriously consider putting only way you will sort out a lot of the problems that you 've got now that 's quite apart from the fact that my own view about this the charm that the model of char 's is flawed and that if it 's off is very interesting because what 's happening is the issues are being raised here the going well beyond the Shire I 'm getting feedback from all around the state now that 's that 's a bit of a worry it 's also a bit of an opportunity it 's a worry in the sense that you 're not alone in some of the problems that you face that they are widespread and there are a lot of people in other showers want these problem solves so there are shared things but there are you know this unique things for this for this council to face up to and what a fantastic opportunity is to to start from scratch and rethink things rethink now one of the things that distresses me is but we 're in credible economic downturn and it 's my opinion that the in this country underplaying it and I 'm privileged to get information that others don 't get to telling it how sick the economy is how sick things are in East Gippsland I noticed today in Paynesville I 've heard about the shops closing and lakes entrance and been stopped but they 're closing in Paintsville there is deep deep pain in this community and I find it incredible that you 've been prepared a budget that doesn 't have any economic indicators associated with how can you prepare a budget that doesn 't take into account the economic circumstances in which we live in but if most of you gathered about the capacity of the community to meet or a community to paid nothing there 's no economic indicators I 've really seen a budget that doesn 't have some assumptions about economic indicators however if we had some in the economic indicators when you start they would be a lot now so I plead plead plead with you to worry about our ratepayers and how they 're coping I plead with you to freeze the rates Matt time good look at the model I accept the fact it 's a great model is flawed and and I think we should put a lot of options on the table how to deal with it and I think that would be a very helpful and constructive thing but in the meantime please PLEASE freeze the rights but get the farmers a half 50% reduction net net of the government of the government subsidy just to keep things alive look can I say to you if you don 't do something about this my conviction is my sense is that this shot is going to be in serious serious difficulty the groundswell it 's incredible the emails I 'm getting are incredible and I said to senator 18 a few minutes ago which I would like to repeat now there 's two categories of people that are coming up that are talking with me there 's one that have been agreed by individual planning decisions and those that are concern about race know things I want you to understand that I will not get involved in individual ratepayer concerns about individual I am concerned about the health of this community the health of the Shire nothing else thank you mr. Tolson are there any questions from the councillors councillor Buckley thank you marry me in European Mintz mr. Dodgson what would happen to this council they declined to support budget as it is coming up in June what 's your it 's a simple question are you saying if the if there isn 't a freeze and if there isn 't fifty percent reductions for farmers so but please now a correction I 'm just saying if we as a group declined to support the budget basically well I don 't understand the intricacies of Shire management but if it 's if it 's like government then there 's no supply I don 't know how you can carry on but I 'm not I 'm not typically qualified to answer that question but if it 's like a government if you 've got supply you can 't carry on would you like to reply to that question mr. C mr. Sayre I 'll have to I 'd have to say today but I 'm happy to take it on notice and and find out the answer which i think is probably wise given we are not constituted level of government as is the state and the federal government so there is there will be slight nuances to how that occur so we 'll take that on notice councillor Buckley me miss counselor Buckley we 're asking questions from the counselors at this point in time so mr. CEO has said that he will answer your question on notice excuse me respectful even had a man ask you a simple question would you mind it 's not the forum for this this is not the forum it 's a refusal Thank You counselor pouts um if I may towards the staff what percentage of a skip snow shower rates are generated from the farm community as a whole miss cones of the total rates and charges it 's just under 10% of the total rates and charges including our wasting missable miss Bennett did you have Thank You Madame mirror I just had a query that I 'm not clear on contemplating sub stating Li the farm is rated by 20% and if I 'm well if I haven 't_''_3751.93 got that right I 'm sorry is it I would like to know the answer themself I thought that was announced my metier but I will have some material that tells me that they were they were contemplating a subsidy of what would considering a subsidy of 20% anyway what I 'm suggesting is rate reduced by 50% are the gross or net thank you can 't_''_3791.499 slip out I 'm a meta me you might enlighten the table with regards to your response from the minister in charge of our rating area and I 'm in charge of local government and what their response was when you wrote and asked for special consideration for a rate relief for the farmers of our region please we haven 't had a risk we 've had a response from the Minister for agriculture who has not refused rate subsidies but hasn 't committed to anything so we 're we 're unaware as a council however we are in frequent communication with her on mr. treasurer can you please stop calling out counselor retainer did you have a question I 'm just wondering madam mayor if mr. Dalton was referring to the 20% differential that we 've suggested look at my records and find where I got that 20 percent from I 'd be surprised if I 've written something like that without having some evidence that it was either contemplated or whatever and if I 'm wrong I apologize but I would just like to say I 've written a massive amount of material in two or three weeks with no assistance from anyone else and that 's not an easy feat and if I 've made a few little mistakes like that then I apologize can 't slack thank you madam mayor um thank you to all the presenters there has been a theme here that it 's pretty much about farm rights what I wouldn 't like to see but I wouldn 't like to see the of where we farmers that sort of thanks counselor watt counselor Alice do you have a question I could ask mr. Bennett in the for this hearing today did we have anyone to speak on behalf of those less fortunate than us in the community age pensioners people on disability pensions people who are suffering from some illness or downturn someone in the retail sector that 's struggling you know the people are less fortunate who don 't have a means to meet any rate increase or any of the other concerns that have been raised because this issue of dividing the community is very important and I would like to think that there is someone out there speaking on behalf of these people as well as the farming community miss was that question directed to miss Bennett counselor Ellis Miss Bennet Miss Bennett can 't slip out with regards to the fact that we 've been working on this these figures since November last last year basically when we started on the budget so it 's something we have gone over and over and over in that time have we had many submissions for consideration of council payments with regards to hardships in the farming sector or in any sector special payment systems any further questions I will now ask the executive manager finance to explain the process following the section two to three committee hearing following and noting that the meeting in terms of considering the budget for adoption is she George for Tuesday the 25th of June so thanks miss Kahn 's I understand that if there 's people who wish to talk to counselors following this hearing that we we do we will convene to discuss and deliberate but I will make five minutes just to talk to people who have attended just so that we can hear this because we 've already had the forum for presenting to our submissions so on that note thank you for attending and I now declare their hearing closed at 37 thank you because it 's nice to be respected by all No _"

    "text": "okay thank you we up to item three deferred deferred business however just before we carry on with that I just like to ask this CEO to like to ask their CEO to say a few words three three through you madam mayor Councillor white as people would have seen I was very emotional his family 's gone through a significant trauma he he needed to go home and has done so supported by friends and family he wanted me to pass on his thanks to counselors and to staff for their support to him and his family and for the kind words and things that have been said to him over this difficult time that he 's going through so he is an apology for the rest of the meeting but he wanted me to pass on those words which I thought was appropriate Thank You mr. CEO item three deferred business there is none item four counselor reports counselor tui sorry thank you mad at me my report is fairly short but amongst a number of counselors went out to on the 24th of January went out to which was very interesting and I did enjoy and I enjoyed the hospitality that people out there the following day the 25th opened an exhibition at the Gippsland art gallery sue Fraser and Clara Jones and I must say it was terrific the the the artwork was was varied the mediums were varied and it was surprising that there was so much variation from just two artists really really good day or evening I should say the 26th Australia Day I was I went up to proven this year as opposed to Paintsville have done paints for the last two years but went up to brew then and thoroughly enjoyed it a very very different feeling up there to Paintsville not quite as formal but very enjoyable and the highlight of the day again to me was the the the lion Lions Club who who catered and you know again those members of our community that give back to our community are just fantastic and sadly there was CFA people and others who couldn 't be there there was fire issues up further but a very enjoyable day and a I thank you madam mayor I was on leave from the 17th of December through to 7th of January I have on the week ending the 21st December 2018 there was an apology and retraction of statement made by council Chiklis this was printed in the East Gippsland news on the 9th of December 2018 and the Bansal advertiser on the 21st of December 2018 and the apology and retraction said that on the 30th of October 2018 at a meeting of council I made statements about the mayoral office and council ratinho I retract these statements I unreservedly apologized to council ratina and I am remorseful and I in the interest of the community accepted that apology on the 15th of January along with yourself madam mayor we received a some information about work ways Gippsland engaged mentoring program and the representative from work ways to discuss the merits of their mentoring program and the positive effect it has had on our region work ways delivers the Gippsland engaged mentoring program in been stopped or by Swiss creeks and lakes entrance the program is about supporting young people at provide mentors one-on-one on a one-on-one basis who will become a friend to the young person and help them with career choices further education and enjoy other activities like Christ 's sport and life experiences once a friendship is formed the student mentor can continue to work together to work through and overcome lots of life 's challenges it 's a really meaningful thing for a region like ours which has lots of disadvantage in lots of France and in particular young people maintaining their education many regional organizations like East Gippsland water have a significant involvement and commitment to the gem program and I believe our organization could actually do more and have a bigger involvement as we have presence right across the Shire and I believe to this end madam mayor that you 've asked for a briefing to come to one of our counselor briefings on having a bigger involvement and the other thing that I 'd like to talk about is the 40th Australian minnow Championships hosted by the Gippsland Lake shock Club which was launched by yourself madam me it was it was a national event the mayor welcomed competitors families and friends to have magnificent kids LAN likes to compete for these national titles there were competitors from all states and territories and as far away as Darwin Munoz is a category for children aged between 8 and 15 years of age and wanting to enter into the sport of sailing a really fantastic program the East Gippsland Shire Council supported the Gippsland Lakes Yacht Club with this event through sponsorship again it highlighted to me the importance of hosting such events especially national events in East Gippsland again like any successful Club in East Gippsland there were many of the club volunteers around for the week to ensure the visitors enjoyed their time here and and on the Gippsland Lakes also a reminder that there is a compelling statistic that confirms that 30 percent of people who invest in our region once a visitor so just another reason to make sure that we continue with our events thank you madam here Thank You councillor Tina council the race thanks man so there 's two matters I 'll know tonight firstly Australia Day celebration I just wanted to congratulate the award recipients across the Shire and I also wanted to congratulate and thank the or boss 'd Rotary Club for their outstanding efforts in catering and looking after us at all bust foot relatively small numbers this year actually I think it was the heat of the day before Friday was I think everybody was just cooked on that particular Saturday and hard to get out of bed secondly counselors tomorrow it 's ten years since the Black Saturday fires and with fires threatening our local community it 's a timely moment to remember the fragility of our lives our community and our environment and I know personally what it 's like to be in that situation because in 2003 on Australia Day I was with a strike team from Glen Ala Dale SAS field and hillside and we survived a terrible burning event at cabin gray in the Alpine fires and he skip slaying and our residents affected by fires and natural disasters so often but what I think is the upside of this is that we are so much better at planning every community needs a limp local incident management plan when we as a Shire as our active in this matter now and I 'm pleased to note that our Marlow residents and rate payers Association recently distributed our when in our little community and every resident in Marlow has that on their fridge now and I think it 's important just to take a moment to remember those more than 170 lives who are lost in Victoria many in Gippsland to note the survivors here in afar their loved ones and their friends of that terrible event ten years ago they 'd never happen again but it 's hotter and it 's drier for longer thank you Thank You councillor raves councillor Robert thank you madam man I on the 24th of January attend the fingerboards mine site tour I attended the Australia Day ceremony in Paynesville which was I think was down on numbers a little bit also but it was well organized and emceed by Martin Richardson he did a fantastic job hosting it and afterwards I I feel a little bit guilty about this but I I truly impressed by the quality and quantity of the hard handcrafted wares at the Painesville craft with a very impressive it 's not so little organization operates similar to a or more accurately a woman 's shed they have over 100 members that work 364 days a year which is quite an impressive feat for an organization made up of volunteers I hope that when their lease agreement is reconsidered by council that it be renewed for the long term community community groups like this play a vital part in the well-being and mental health and as such should be nurtured attended the Australia Day citizenship ceremony here in this chamber and we intend I attended a planning consultation meeting and on the 1st of feb 10 de France of bats and habitats East Gippsland community meeting in response to the the extreme heat event that occurred on the day before Australia Day when we have was it believe it was the Australia Day weekend when there was approximately to hit 2,000 gray-headed flying foxes that died so we met with this I met with this organization among a lot for assessing gray-headed flying foxes in future I intend to get the required vaccinations so I can assist with bat futures and sari rescues in the future the grey head of flying fox plays our vulnerable species and play a critical role to our forest as one of our only long-range pollinators it was also nice just to be there in the presence of a couple of baby bats that were getting bottle fed and a baby wombat which made it nice so until I get the shots though no pets thank you madam ear I think it 's councillor Roberts councillor Buckley thank you mad at me Australia Day was a bit of a physiognomy Oh however the Lions did their usual excellent job binax organising the egg and bacon breakfast and was much appreciated by the minimal attendance and we hope we can do better next year bushfires in the area was the main reason for the poor attendance we think there thank you madam mayor and there 's a PSE Jeff Cooper is the chief lion organizer and does a great job thank you Thank You counselor other matters of visits that counsel Jackson Roberts alluded to I 'll just run quickly through my report pleased to report to having experienced a quiet lengthy Christmas recess with council meetings being concluded earlier than expected this is January stutter commenced with the truth with gusto and with many interactions with their community a couple of civic and other events were the you mention include the Australia Day event at lakes entrance which contrary to the others would well patronized with over 300 attendees entertainment this year was provided with the music of Ayrshire sponsored brass band been some brass band and we 're really good together with a most entertaining and appreciated push power lots of highlights and insights into the Australian culture the lakes entrance line Club like the omiai Lions Club were again the the successful unintelligible organizers of the event I also attended the citizenship ceremony before going to that I 'd like to mention this special likes entrance citizens who are recognized here and that was mrs. Judy Burgess senior citizen of the year from the Lakes Entrance ambulance auxilary someone known to us MP who was our juniors citizen of the year from the Lakes Entrance Surf Club Jameson to a delightful young lady and were most worthy of that award the Men 's Shed was the event of the year the opening of the mention which got canceled routine I think from memory opened when he was men the team was first in the creation of this value community as asset people are recognized amongst the numbers were mr. Daryl Patterson from the men shared and Wendy Brady and the fellow lines eccentrics Lions Club coming I want to make is Australia Day also gives councillors the opportunity to address the communities on matters that affect their everyday life in my address to the community this year are not only made mention of the celebration of our nation but also to the challenges that face people on a daily basis in struggling to be part of and enhancing this great country in particular made mention the challenges of the burden of mental illness upon the peoples of our country and the need for us to exhibit a more emphatic approach to the depressing and impact on all of our communities and at any time in doing so I spoke of the great opportunity next year I start again in doing so I highlighted the great opportunities Gibson County currently holds with reports that the Hope drug rehabilitation center said to be capable of housing up to 115 beds for those less fortunate my sense start construction on its first stage with the lack of adequate or sufficient mental health facilities reported in these good plan what better opportunity is there for all of us as a community to unite with those associated with the care of others and encourage the state government to purchase the land on which the rehabilitation center is to be constructed proprietor propria try and personnel and thus provide us with a current a facility to address both the mental health and drug addition issues of our community perhaps the Hope Foundation board may wish to consider this suggestion as an aside I hope that this might have been picked up but with the Chinese wall in existence and I won 't go into that that all said Australia Day and our great country oh no no no no no I congratulate our current mayor and the 18 members of our community who became citizens of our great country on Australia Day on a personal note I would like to welcome my friend mr. James Murphy of Lakes Entrance and a past work colleague mr. Tony I 've been Star Wars Australian citizens I 've also been asked by a number of people who make mention the work of miss Alison Brewer and her community and their committee for ensuring that new New Year 's Eve in Lakes Entrance was again such a success in doing so would also be remiss not to acknowledge the positive impact the chance carnival has had upon the seaside holiday experience of likes entrants for many over the over the season mr. mrs. chant are to be congratulated I would also like to make mention of the good work at the Ben star Motorplex Ben star matter sports club so in running their various offense attracted around 10,000 actual visitors to our region over several meetings in January their committee is to wider benefit it brings to our economy many other sporting bodies must be envious of their success and in concluding I 'd like to to record would council the passing of a of a most respected been stolen East Gippsland citizen there mr. Roger McComb recently many of us here in in the chamber will recall mccombs observations and suggestions to council on improving a lot of these skips lenders my sincere condolences go to his wife Katherine thinking that of me thanks counselor Ellis Katz lapels thank you madam me counselor Ellis she gave me in front I thought you were going to President American president about the Great Wall thank you mr. Trump thank you madam mayor I would just like to say what a hot dry summer we 've had and I don 't think anyone is disappointed with the recent rain we received over the past weekend and I managed to tip out 37 meals out of my rain gauge from the beans fell property so I just thought I just put that in stray today for me was in can River and without gorgeous community award for their volunteer acknowledgement day and it was just awesome now we 're all there at the park in can River enjoying the and they were all doing what they normally do 75% of the community up there are actually volunteers and it 's awesome they 're so nice and they do the best they can on a really tight budget and I just really wanted to commend the efforts that they 've put in the fingerboards visit that we shared with many of the counselors Roberts between o2e Ellis our men was really interesting and it occurred timely which was just after an interesting presentation from calibre that same week so it was really good to have the two together and and no one can deny that we haven 't heard everything possible about the aspect of the proposal of the mineral sands mine so I think we 're over that and tonight showed the passion of the community from the region and you know and also hats off to the caliber representatives that were here in the audience amongst 150 delegates who were opposing the position so a process to go through and there 's still a time factor involved but um I think we 'll get there with regards to looking after our community I 'm in the middle of December I attended the GSD princess highway review inter algún from Sydney to Adelaide which was initiated by our beloved Honourable Darren Chester our federal member of 80 skips man one of the great initiatives mr. Chester you instigated whilst acting in his role as Federal Minister for transport and infrastructure was the review which he came up with after being presented with the princess Highway petition from the seats group which I chair so I 've been really pleased that this has been something we 've been able to follow through and contribute to and I have to say the meeting was well ran in three different locations on the day being Hamilton Geelong and tur algún and and we all had a webinar link facility so that we could basically chat about our findings and share what we actually came up with other delegates from the Western District and you know our fellow councillor Train the Train Alliance meetings and you know what there may be transport infrastructure meetings and was good to be able to share a common interest in upgrade safety upgrades to the princess highway concern so you know it 's great to be able to advocate on behalf of council and our community on better roads safer traveling and more improved transport mechanisms around our communities it 's a really integral part of the work I 've been doing over the ten years of my term on council the week before GHD had also held meetings in New South Wales and they had the same set up for the their community which was in Wollongong and then halfway down what I mean you know bigger I think and and and somewhere in the middle like a Shoalhaven or somewhere like that I 'm out of it all we we were looking forward to the findings of the improved safety upgrades for our communities and for the travellers who actually visiting our region with caravans and boats and enjoying what our reaching and had tourist miles for them and that concludes I 'll just quote talk quickly about the drought which has been on the forefront of most people 's minds in recent times just before Christmas we myself CEO and the deputy met with the major the coordinator general for drought Major General Stephen Day who came to Wellington Shire to speak with local farmers financial counsellors local business owners and council representatives and feedback was given on the drought package and concerns and we are expecting his report to this month we also had a visit from the Honourable Jacqueline Psalms the Minister for agriculture who hadn 't further roundtable discussions with drought affected farmers in the drought reference group coordinated by a substantial I was reinstated the and had a first meeting for 2019 and we discussed many aspects of the drought nuts well represented by a variety of stakeholders including the CWA AV FF s Kipling CMA health services and AG Vic and will continue to meet bimonthly and we also had a drought phone hookup with Darren Chester our federal member so as council will continue to work with the state and federal government and advocate for me it was in pence Dale and the celebrations were organized by the band 's Dale classic car club and supported by the keeps on classic car club and they did a fantastic job in pulling together an event and special mention to David Radford who also put in a lot of work to ensure that that event ran smoothly and he was also emcee for the day and we also heard from our young citizen of the year Ty and Troy who spoke beautifully and I had the privilege of presiding over the Australia Day citizenship ceremony and it marked 70 years since Australian citizenship was introduced into war so it was a great day had by all and I 'll leave it at that thank you okay moving on to officer reports 5.1.1 council meeting schedule 2019 mr. Radford thanks madam man good evening councillors this report seeks a Council resolution to set the dates venues and times on which council meetings will be held during 2019 late tune in 2018 councilors will recall that we held a debrief in relation to the three meetings that were 3rd of April Lakes Entrance on the 5th of June and almost on the 3rd of July the purpose of these council community meetings combined with the alternating starting times between 00 and 00 p.m. of council meetings and the commencement of live-streaming has increased the community involvement and the engagement in council meetings and activities the report before you tonight is the proposed council meeting scheduled for 2019 and summary key points of the proposed changes from the traditional schedule are as follows combining the traditional special and or ordinary council meetings to maximize the best use of counselor and staff time for council in the community meetings proposed outside of the council chamber in 2019 compared to the three that were held last year and the town 's nominated by councillors of mallacoota proposed for March 5th Lakes Entrance on June 4th only Oh on September 10 and almost on November 12 localized community and council activities would be clustered around these meetings to maximize the involvement between council and the community building on the success and positive community feedback that we received in relation to the departure tonight would provide a council community meeting for each calendar quarter during 2019 and also allows for a winter recess from meetings in July which is consistent with the other two tiers of government councillors would note the two meetings in the schedule that you have before you tonight are proposed to be held during June the reason is this is due to tight timelines with a draft council plan and budget development and it will also allow for the incorporation of submissions through this section two to three process where appropriate so the review of 2018 council in your community meetings that identified only minor budgetary impacts predominantly based around travel and holding these meetings during the day will allow the minimal impact compared to night meetings and that 's what 's been reflected in the schedule so councillors it 's a requirement of our local law that the dates venues and tires for council meetings are set by a resolution of council and if the schedule is adopted by council receiving it would be widely promoted through our traditional digital communications channels such as local newspapers papers of counselors there 's a recommendation before you and be happy to take any questions Thank You mr. Radford is there any questions councilors moved seconded by Councillor to ii speakers for sorry madam may I 'd like to move an amendment to include a point three on the recommendation and the council meeting scheduled okay speakers for okay anyone like to speak for initiative last year to hold some council meetings out in our community I think was was terrific and to see four in here I think he 's even better so really looking forward to getting out there and meeting people councilor retainer I just like to add the work that 's gone into putting the program together his first class and really really delighted to see mallacoota included in there I mean it takes a lot more effort but I 'm sure that community will enjoy having us up there having our ordinary council meeting up there on the 5th of March thank you thanks counselor Tina can slip out thank you it would be remiss of me not to say I 'm sorry I am I say it 's a great initiative to be back out on the road again for us counselors because in the past we 've always enjoyed the traveling and getting out amongst the our outer IRB 's and getting amongst the community so I think with regards to that I think we have done a really good there is a really great program in front of us and also tonight that and there was a curious holiday time putting between june the twenty feet and our next meeting follows the 6th of August to highlight they 've actually given us a month of grace so to know that we can get all the same work done in the same amount of time is refreshing to think that we actually have a terminated period in the middle so I look forward to I 'm enjoying that as well and doing getting out and marks the community so thank you for that Thank You councillor pouts any further speakers if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you mr. Radford five point one point two appointment I think the report is fairly self-explanatory in relation to white is being presented but there is an opportunity and despite the fact that councillors are actually appointed for the term of office there is an opportunity after an election of the mayor and deputy mayor to have a look and for councillors to determine whether they still have capacity to attend the meetings hence that is why the table has been attached to this report for councillors consideration and also you 'll see there 's there 's two appointments that need to be considered by council as well thank you mister Bashford are there any questions no do we have a mover Thank You counselor Ellis okay Thank You counselor robots meta may try again with this item I 'd like to put forward an amendment to the recommendation to include point three and point three reads that a comprehensive review of councilor committee representation inclusive of industry forums be completed and presented to our may 20 19 ordinary council meeting the review to include but not limited to the need for the council representation point be a structured by councilors including industry forums ie example alga and Canberra point C a cost-benefit analysis be completed on what value our community is receiving by councillors attending forums and being represented on external committees and point D that I wish to be removed from as a committee or a second committee member for the Municipal Association Victoria 's professional development reference group because I feel my professional ethics and standards and values don 't align with the MA V 's view of professional development thank you thank you it Thank You councillor Tina do we have a seconder that yep Bingbing three does that there 's I wish to be removed as a committee member specify yourself thanks counselor robert 's counselor raise you second good speakers the amendment I just think that we 've we 've had this sort of system and process in place for a while now and like all good things we should do a review if the review comes back and ticks all the boxes will so be it but I think it 's a good time to do a review and I 've checked back by May which will mean some sort of briefing before that meeting and I 'm assured that the timings okay to do that sort of a review thank you thank you speaker question because this is such quick notice and we only I think Jo just mention it briefly this afternoon that he was looking at this I didn 't expect this to be here tonight I have no I 've got no real at the base it we got no rule but there are things there that probably we need to have discussed these in a better manner because we need to know exactly what we 're talking about representations which are quarterly meetings you know we if we 're going to have this coming back by May it 's perhaps going to be one meeting you know and then when you look at these representative meetings the secretariat of each of these groups provide minutes and and attachments etc so you know you 're creating perhaps and the money saying perhaps because I haven 't given this enough thought unnecessary demand will work for a particular council hate to be the counselor coming back from the Audit Committee try to explain something when there is full minutes already available cost the benefit value are really you know I 'm not sure about what we actually mean by that and then the conflict professional development on I respect but yes I 've respected Joan your training in your education but I 'd like to get an understanding of what that challenge is and if you have some better skills than achieved the and and they may be a lacking will do you really should be there to sort them out night so I don 't know where we can read with which to early this and perhaps we should be deferring this and having the matter of subject of a future counselor see our discussion and bring it back saying March I 'm not trying to thought this but I 'm just thinking it 's a bit quick and there are questions there that could be discussed and I 'd be happy for Joe to respond to me on that because I 'm not trying to make things just curious as to with the reporting back from you know everyone will that all be formalized in one single folder or you know we 'll be able to have it collated and then do we actually have some kind of cost analysis attached to that particular issue or is it just done on a counselor base thing I mean I 'm happy either way it doesn 't worry bit I 'm just sort of wanting you know spoke out and see how you know how far it needs to go in regards to cost-effectiveness analysis that 's all anything further speakers I 'm happy to speak forward I think it 's a good amendment I think the two councils that I 've been involved in these sort of just rolled along and there 's a great opportunity now to to review it I think it 'll be very easy to produce some sort of reporting template that we can populate very simply and easily and and share that I think the cost-benefit analysis well there can be up to the offices to work out how how best to do by meeting benefit and whether it 's a social benefit of financial benefit environmental benefit for our community there is a cost to democracy and governance but there 's also I think a great opportunity to see the benefit as well and the view of transparency and reporting to our community art I think it 's a good idea yeah I 'd have to think about it for a while but I think it 's worth prosecuting thanks counselor ease any further speakers I 'd like to move to defer it like this is this is the first time I read it and I don 't don 't disagree with it he imprinted a little bit that 's just by picking up as there was a small issue with the writing now don 't know there 's anything else wrong with it but with just reading it once or twice I can 't confidently say that I support it but I 'm happy to to consider it later on and as counselor Ellis said the data that would come back in May would be pretty pretty limited yeah open open I just briefly that in May I mean not gonna die in the ditches if this doesn 't get carried but a review is a review and the relevant information can come back we 've been on this same sort of committee type structure for a long time I 'm sure there 's enough information there for um the CEO to come back with some sort of analysis and where we take it from there that 's all this is about if it 's all final that 's good in relation to just responding to councillor al-assad no way no and do I think I 'm more superior than anybody but my values on how yeah my yeah my views on professional development and developing people don 't align with the way that I think they 're maybe do it so I 'd prefer not to be involved with that but other than that you know the bottom line is stealing your thunder Maryann I need to make sure that whatever we 're doing that our community is getting some value out of it and whether it 's public value but I need to be sure that all the things and we all do a great job we 're going all over the place doing all sorts of things but I want to make sure that our community community is getting the best value out of it thanks counselor Tino I 'll put the motion all those in favor of the amendment all those against okay motion carried what was at five now becomes the motion sorry need to get that right okay so now we speak again sorry I probably much that up we 've accepted the amendment and that now becomes the motion okay so Jo and seconded by Councillor hours and councilors Roberts using this interesting of I 've got a support a motion I just voted against how does that work trouble is that I support the actual major recommend a alright what I 'll do is I 'll speak to it by simply saying councillors I do support the appointments and the the drive of the particular motion before us I had genuine hesitancies in relation to dot point three for the matters that I points one and two of this particular motion and on talking in circles but we 've got a lot of circular discussion seven things the motion okay are there any other speakers no I 'll put the motion to all those in favor all those against councillor Buckley motion carries seven one thank you okay five point one point three petition requesting expression of interest process to occupy council own property at fifty five Palmer 's Road lakes entrance miss kya Cashman thank you madam mayor yes we can circulate that sorry miss Cashman that 's fine at the council meeting held on the 11th of December council was presented with the petition requesting council to explore the possibility of undertaking a commercial expression of interest process for the occupancy of the property at fifty five Palmer 's Road Lakes Entrance in receiving that petition in December of last year council officers noted that a report would be forthcoming to this particular meeting whereby that that expression of interest proposal would be considered however officers when investigating this request felt that in the interest of the broader community the future further discussion in Riga so the report presented to you tonight identifies some of the historical and future elements requiring consideration of the property 's use both now and into the future with some of those being the decisions that have already been made by Council and respect to the future use of that site the opportunities that may be available to council to maximize the return on investment for the community in the short to medium term the longer term role of that particular site in respect of the lakes entrance note northern growth area which is now performing part of the East Gippsland planning scheme the council 's internal operational requirements and also the only you need tourism opportunity that may well be realized by an expression of interest process so given the need to comprehensively determine whether or not a commercial expression of interest process is in fact the most prudent use of this public asset and whether it complements the broader requirements of the shire and its residents officers would like to see request sufficient time to engage an external consultant to comprehensively investigate this notion to Council at its august 2019 meeting with that said and as a matter of courtesy officers will as put in as part of that recommendation officers will be required to write back to the head petitioner to explain their reason for this particular request as a matter of courtesy so that if there any further questions I 'd ask that you can see that the proposal in front of you thank you thank you Mr Cashman are there any questions councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor in order to engage in appropriate external provider and source all the you know relevant information to make a more educated decision on this do we have an approximate time frame or costing that this will incur Thank You councillor Roberts no not as yet we will be working like that obviously depending on the decision tonight that 'll be other first and foremost matter that we need to address miss Bennett the scope will be something thank you counselor Ellis I 'm just concerned about how we 're going to manage the cost of this and what we do so what are out and then it will come back to us as a report to an ordinary meeting advising us of the cost and counsel will then have to vote on whether we go ahead with that work officers believe that we have that view that 's the purpose any further questions no okay there 's a motion do we have someone to move it counselor Tino Thank You counselor to ii ii speakers for just briefly madam mayor this is a strategic piece of work it 's well overdue for our community our communities to know that we are working all our assets to the best community value ensuring that we always continue to deliver the best public value on all assets our community deserves this nothing more nothing less thank you thank you counselor I do wish to speak thank you madam me I agree with what what Joe has said making sure that we utilize our assets to the best of our abilities is one of the roles that we play as counselors so going through this process I think will will allow us to better understand just what where potentially we want to head with this I think this is a good idea Thank You counselor Pelt yes and I just like to make notice that we have actually probably within the last three or four years we did look at trying to get the fisheries or one of the federal government the government bodies when they were trying to decentralized into this building so too just for the community to fully understand it is something that we have actually initiated and tried but we were unsuccessful and they took a position on Bullock Island instead with that CMAC Center so the bottom line is it is something that we have been engaged in actively with in the last 18 months anyway and this is just a further push to you know see if we can facilitate some more stimulus and any interest in getting another person or some kind of income coming in from that body from that building or that site so you have really good initiative and I look forward to the outcome thank you thanks council pouts counselor Ellis thanks madam mayor I think strategic issue well as councilor ratinho referred to in management of assets I think I can see this justifying the need for us to look into our other I said such as the service street store there and how we deal with that particular building and and and the rentals associated with that we 've previously looked into this it 's probably the start for the CEO and company to look into the profit asset management of all our facilities our work yards and what have you so we could perhaps use this as the wider picture to look into Pro Asset Management it 's a total do we keep open our shop fronts in places like or Boston I mean oh do we you know he 's there value there as well as looking at the facility and Mike 's entrance it would be a good opportunity to take advantage of that and widen the scope so that we can now then turn around to the community looking backwards of course because this is not the first time this facility has been reviewed and then looking to the forward to open his mind to the wider asset base that we have and use this as the catalyst for it so I 'll support the motion with that sort of mine basis coming up out of this discussion any further speakers councillor Reeves hmm thank you look interesting thoughts councillor Ellison had crossed my mind to that it took a poke from the community to actually motivate us into action here and if there in terms of a petition and if there was a way of systematizing that but also perhaps pricing placing some limitations you know at what infrastructure or facilities do we not go investigating I mean boat ramps obviously you know that sort of thing so there has to be some limitation but yeah that 's a great challenge for the CEO and I support this thank you any further speakers if not I 'll put the motion motion all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you Miss cushon item 5.1 point for finance report period ending 31st December 2018 miss Lisa Gosselin Collins thank you madam mayor the finance report is for the first six there is range of information attached to the report but this report is the statutory report where we report our year-to-date performance against the year today budget and also provide a forecast for our end of year position councilors will note that the operating surplus forecasts for the full year as had been reported in the first quarter is less than what we had in the budget as a result of projects that were not completed until the current financial year but the cash for those projects was already in our bank also to note which councillors are aware that albeit this year is forecast to be a relatively small operating surplus that that was impacted by the advance payment of the just over seven million dollars of the current year general purpose grant from the Victoria Grants Commission so having said that there 's a range of information attached to the report there are no concerns at this stage a year to date result is being impacted by timing of some of the payments for supplier payments and contractor payments and payments for some consultancy works and you 'll terms of our expenditure for the first six months but at this stage there are no major material variances apart from the ones already reported there has been some minor adjustments in some income and expenditure items and to note also the in the interest on investment forecasts as a result of us some delays in the the capital works from last year and the prepayment of the Grants Commission funding so we 've been able to earn some additional interest which is good so I 'm happy to take any questions questions councillors you know if not do we have a mover councillor retainer councillor Reeves thank you speakers councillor retainer thank you miss Collins and and again please I just like to thank you and your department for the great work that you do and actually bringing all these reports together having spent some time in finance in a previous life and being tagged a friend of Finance I really appreciate the work that goes in behind these final reports so thanks Liz and yeah thank you Thank You councillor Jane oh all right any further speakers no carried unanimously thank you thanks mr. Collins and five point one point five draft writing strategy 2019-20 over to you again thank you madam me the draft reading strategy is an important document in terms of the budget development for the 1920 year and there 's only been a few changes in terms of the strategy and they relate to the municipal charge and the modeling in of various scenario scenarios to bring in a reduce municipal charge into the mix in terms of the calculation for the rates it isn 't proposed at this stage to change the differential rates and one of the main reasons for not looking further into other models for the differential rating is that this is the first year where the value general Victoria is undertaking the revaluation and it 's an annual revaluation of all ratable properties previously it was every second year but in terms of the impact of that through into the individual category of ratepayers that 's yet to be known the other while and why this also has come forward is just a single year rating strategy once again Act and where that 's at that it allows us then to look at any changes that we may need to make in terms of our revenue and rating strategy if that comes to fruition into the home near future so in terms of the modeling that 's been done for the ratings strategy it does propose that the municipal charge be reduced to 14 percent of total rates and charges maximum 14 percent from the 18 percent that I was sitting at and in terms of there has been foreshadowed if the new Local Government Act was to come in that that would be no more than 10 percent so that gives us a step down because that does lead to a redistribution of rates amongst the three categories of ratepayers just by way of the change in the rating the dollar that 's required same amount of rates just a different distribution there is information attached to show the impact of the various models to the document the I guess the other thing just to note also is the 2.5 a cap for that rate that will be with and that we won 't be seeking a variation to that there 's other information in there in terms of payment options etc that councilor do offer and including the rating strategy so happy to take any questions on that made a meal thanks miss Collins questions councillors councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor thank you miss Collins has there been any considerable changes to other service charges like service charges and waste collection charges so at this stage in terms of the fees for waste collection and the waste fees in general the cost recovery approach is used for the waste recovery in terms of working out what the garbage domestic garbage charge would be the fees and charges for waste are included in the draft fees and charges for all the tipping fees but in terms of the garbage charge that sits on the rate notes that sits outside of the rate cap and it 's very much used in the total model of full cost recovery for waste services as we 're working through in conjunction with the rating strategy sorry I 'm a little bit considerable charge to waste collection fees at this stage it would be proposed that the garbage charge that 's included on the rate notice for the curbside collection would increase around about the 2.5 to 3 percent that 's what we would be modeling in at this stage but once again until we 've actually finalized all the costs the waste you know that may need a further review but they will be put separately to council through the budget process for a review as well and a tick off yes thank you thank you madam an Thanks councillor pouts mr. cohen 's if I just may follow up with from jackson 's comment with regards to the waste when you said it was where we 're trying to get to full cost waste recovery are you saying or referring to what it was and correct me if i 'm wrong what was bought in a couple of years back where we were actually aiming to get 100% cost recovery with regards to our waste knowing that the chinese had actually decided not to take commercial waste from our region Thank You Cancer Council of Health yes there has been a number of costs that have impacted on that total cost for that waste service and in terms of the waste strategy there was a stepping up of fees overtime in the normal fees and charges that council was working through in terms of how that 's going to come out for this next budget and going forward where where it was projected that there will be significant cost increase for the processing of the green waste and the transport of the green waste as well as the impact on the the cost for recyclables we 'll work through that as we work through the budget process and we 'll bring those wastes will be if you like considered not separately but as part of the budget review process with council for further discussion in its own right because there 's a number of things that the waste area are looking at in terms of how they may deal with those additional costs and in terms of the recovery whether that 's a full cost recovery this year but into where we should be aiming but there 's obviously steps along the way so that will be form part of the budget workshops more information counselor Ellis discussion so there 's no misunderstanding this document and this discussion this evening is not about three increases or waste management fee increases at all there 's no Thank You councillor Allison no that 's correct even though it does lead to those questions this is really about our general rates and rating strategy use of municipal charge and also about some of the options that we actually adopt as council for people to be able to pay their rates yes and thank you so I would encourage anyone to read the briefing sheet to see that the balance of percentages on rating strategies and one and and percentages that are that will be the subject as the base of our rating process is to be said in this document we will be working through the budge process over the next three or four months for any other issues that arise as in the normal budget process its Thank You counselor Thank You change of the municipal charge I wanted to ask if if you for sort four if you could foresee any continuation to the reduction of the municipal charge I know we 're considering it if if all we 're required to do it if there 's a new local government act brought in but do you see if the new local government act isn 't brought in next year that will continue to reduce a municipal charge amount to get a closer to ten percent yeah ten percent I 'm thinking councilor Jackson that will be a decision of council was the council it 's the councilor decision in terms of the adoption of the raiding strategy and how they may use the municipal charge so if it wasn 't legislated to move that back down council it 's up to the council to decide if they wish to do that and then that just moves how the rates are distributed but certainly that 's just a council decision okay any further questions councillor Buckley oh this is another question this is just a comment that Dom opposed to the fair that you should have to pay if you 've got a vacant block for a service charge for services you 're not getting and there 's about roughly half the council 's in Victoria don 't even have it one of those confusing devising things so I 'm going to oppose this on those grounds thank you mad at me I 'm posing the budget my suggestion is we do away with it all together and be done with it and I 'll give that in debate so again you might like to argue that and debate yeah okay well that 's my position there okay thank you if there 's no further questions then I 'll ask to have a move on I 'm happy to move recommendation thanks counselor tanner is there a second off thanks counselor pouts that speaker mad at me I don 't want to say a lot other than wuj all counselors to follow on from what counselor Ellis was saying to actively participate and understand the implications of the rating strategy all assumptions and changes need to be included as part of to complete all the necessary complex calculations computations and scenarios to deliver a ballad but a balanced budget against our rating strategy it is not fair or good governance or being open and transparent to leave this to the final meeting where we adopt the budget Thank You councillor pouts yes I just like to say I 'm really refreshed to see Council the Buckley 's lifelong ambition to reduce or get rid of the municipal charge at least we 're reducing it finally and we 've been a contentious issue ever since we 've been on council but I 'm really refreshed to see that we 're taking the line of trying to reduce this at this and getting in front of the ballgame so that when the new local government that comes in we 're actually it 's not so impactful on our community I think it 's responsible governance and I think it 's really responsible of us to be initiating this to our community so I 'm delighted to be thickening this motion Thank You councillor pouts councillor Roberts yeah I 'd like to speak to time last year that I contacted Mary Ann Bennett saying that I wanted to run the numbers on removing the municipal charge and I nearly her to fall over over the phone but what I was what I was meant mean to say that I would like to see it conceded for the following year and here we are we don 't quite have the municipal charge completely abolished but I think it is a good step in the right direction and I would like to continue to see this sliding scale continue that way so thanks Liz thanks Mary Ann thanks all thank you further speakers okay I 'll put the motion all those in favor all those against he 's carried seven one yeah thank you thank you leads five point one point 6 review public space closed-circuit television surveillance policy miss Claire kashering thank you madam mayor councillors before you tonight is the annual review of the current closed-circuit television surveillance policy and the code of practice with accompanies that particular policy in part in the mid part of 2018 you will be aware that East Gippsland program by the Victorian order to general 's offices office which scrutinized the controls and processes that council currently have in place for recording and administering the content the content captured upon those those CCTVs while least keeps lancha a council did fare well in as part of that particular audit way I did make further recommendations to improve the strength and rigor around our oversight of that program which have been captured within this policy the with that said there are other changes that have primarily been made to these to the policy in itself is that we have transferred that policy from the old template to councilors new policy template which was adopted the other option that we are wanting to seek your consideration on is now that this program has been in place for quite some time some time that the review and adoption of the policy and the code of practice become two yearly event rather than it being an annual event given that council officers feel that the processes and the controls within that policy now give us a little bit more surety around the audit and Risk Committee have reviewed both documents prior to that being tabled here tonight and noted that there were any matters of substance that needed to be amended and further the CCTV steering committee which is made up of a group of Representatives local chamber of commerce Victoria Police Council officers and the maintenance technicians for those particular program have also had input and insight into the current version of this particular policy so I 'm happy to field any questions on the code of practice or the policy thank you thanks miss passion questions Thank You counselor Tina seconder thanks counselor rabbits speakers matter may adjust quickly this was a potential non-conformance that at the time was highlighted in in the auditors general 's report and unfortunately some local media outlets chose to try and make a story out of nothing the identified non-conformance was a challenge for us as an organization to close a loop of a potential issue that piece of information was unfortunately left out of the reported issue last year continuous improvement always is and always will be an area of focus for any Mr Cashman thanks counselor Tina counts the Roberts thank you madam mayor I 'd like to reiterate what councilor Bertino has said but I also like to continue to see council especially in this play in this space to take a proactive approach to maintaining these policies because these ones are critically important and can be really sensitive as outlined if the media picks these things up and we 're dealing with people 's privacy here and we should be on the forefront of policy and not playing catch-up so hopefully we can we can maintain and even lead the way like like we are in other areas so thank you for your work thank you any further speakers councillors if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor the motion carried unanimously thank you Mr Cashman and 5.2.1 Victoria state emergency service Memorandum of Understanding for support of Vick SES units occupancy arrangements miss Cashman thank you madam mayor so councillors before you tonight is a proposal based upon a memorandum of understanding that was executed between the Victorian Government the Victorian SES and the Municipal Association sites occupied by the SES volunteer units across Victoria part of that Memorandum of Understanding was a potentially a change to the funding operations of those those particular sites that fall under the auspice of their mo and in terms of their sites here in East Gippsland that do fall under that particular dock the control of that framework is the breathing SES site the can River Site the mallacoota site and all the site so following discussions with the director corporate of Vick SES and local regional director we the council office is actually set to determining whether or not the proposed changes to the lease arrangements under the MOU were in fact fitting of councils like a strategic direction for some of those particular sites and it was discovered that while we do agree that there are some of those sites where we can move our responsibilities to Vick SES there were some parcels of land where those sites it that could potentially be gifted per se under the section 191 of the Local Government Act to those to those particular sites there was a relatively large amount that was in fact an appropriate discussion and question to be put to you and also some financial analysis of not only the cost savings that will be attracted because we aren 't funding those particular sites now for 50 percent of their operating costs but also the reduction in costs in terms of insurance related premiums maintenance and and those ongoing I guess financial implications that could be part of that discussion so the to in mind in that respect were those sites at the almost five walls Lee Street address and the can river 29 manaro highway and though those we understand that they do have some financial value and they could be realized as a gain for council sure they wish to realize that at some point and sell those properties by themselves but council officers believe that you know you know to effect a positive relationship and make sure that those services continue well on into the future that it would be worth considering that we enact section one nine one of the Local Government Act and and transfer those particular sites to the Vic SES 191 the other thing to note that it 's that normally when we undertake such a process a section two to three is required but because of the fact that where we 'll be transferring that put in there but because it 's actually being transferred to a public body the requirement for us to undertake a section two to three process for that particular transfer is not needed so so that 's something to consider in respect of the Bruin the brooding site at 51 Main Street bruising there was a significant amount of internal consultation went has taken place and it was felt that although we do want to support the because yes unit at that particular site the the the proposal under the agreement was that that was going to be a very long term lease and it was considered that that perhaps leave that perhaps wouldn 't be the best fit for the strategic objectives for that site for council moving into the future so so we 're recommending it has about a 12 year term remaining on the current lease agreement and we 're proposing and then we would be looking to liaise with big SES at some point in time to try and offer a get a balanced lease arrangement whereby councils strategic objectives for that site might be changing but we don 't want to impede their growth and the sustainability of that service for the brooding community as well and finally the mallacoota the mallacoota site at 35 Lee 's Road mallacoota that is currently a hybrid of sorts whereby the council the building is owned by council however it 's situated on Crown and so the recommendation in front of you is suggesting that we again under Section 191 of the Local Government Act transfer the building to Vickers yes and they have made it known that they 're quite willing to assume the committee of management responsibilities for that particular site as well so those thought those are the four that fall under the the memorandum of understanding and the other thing that we also undertook at that point in time was that the bends don 't because EES unit the lease arrangements for that particular site we 're also that with that and it 's quite a relatively easy process that we reassigned that lease to V Casey s taking away any responsibilities for that particular arrangement moving forward so the attachment attachment one is like I said a detailed analysis of the financial implications so there will be savings financially in terms of operating costs but bearing in mind that there will be potentially some I guess a negative impact for instance if we decide to transfer those land those parcels of land and no consideration to those sites so that would be a decision for council to make so I 'm happy to field any questions on that report thank you Thank You councillor Phelps you 're just curious that if we were to go through go ahead with this the state of the buildings are at a hundred percent you know repaired and and you 'd being able to be used now would there be any time in the future that they bodies would come back to us for funding to do repairs in regards to upgrades to their buildings I think he counselled helps it this particular report normally when we transfer any land with associated infrastructure on it the responsibility for that is assumed by the purchaser so I can 't speak for those particular groups coming back at some point time but in terms of standard contractual arrangements their liability will transfer to the Vic SES any yep counselor Roberts explained like I 'm five so for a nil consideration transfer is that essentially a sale as a gifting of the property and if so is there is there a reason why we 're not just looking at a like a very low-cost lease arrangement long term lease arrangement something similar to the benamber school site Thank You councillor Roberts look that was conceded and I think that and director corporate and director community strategy or welcome to to join the conversation but in terms of looking at the ongoing costs that would be associated with keeping that at a low peppercorn rates lease it it started to tip the balance in terms of it being a financially viable option for us moving forward there you know I counsel Pelt said you know potentially be required to keep those buildings up to some sort of specification but I guess it was just thought that this would be a really good public public service to be able to offer that and potentially reduce our longer-term costs the reason I compared it to the benamber school side is because they 're liable for any maintenance costs in that lease period so some a model similar to that yes but I guess there there 's also the other wrong costs that yeah and you know like where we 're looking at other potential parcels of land that we might want to be realizing at some point in time that certainly could be an option for you but I guess those ones where there where VCS are concerned that we want to make sure that they have a secure and stable place to stay for quite a some time and that this may be their well the approach we need to do in order to affect that miss Bennett if I could just one the major yes we can do very much but the likelihood of those doing is and virtually all their races our responsibilities so the longer we the odds of us will recline he 's weak can 't_''_4875.57 slip out if we were to do these and pass it on other ongoing costs to the SES in the in regards to righties then become writable properties yeah I was just doing my other questions I 'm not sure how much what what the support is around the table but I 'd sort of like to see maybe an option B to because it 's Quadra there 's quite a lot to be considered in the recommendation I might be asking too much but that 's just my my initial feeling happy to take guidance from other councillors councillor to e Minds own minds about your comment and I was coming from your position during the previous conversation that we 've had in regards to this and you know realizing the the financial benefit from getting rid of an asset was where I initially come from but the benefits to the communities that they are reme the long-term benefits to the communities that these buildings in the last couple of weeks and I must say I have sort of changed my attitude towards that because it at the end of the day there are some cost savings and I hate losing an asset we 're all trained from when we 're young to gather assets as we go but from this point of view I believe this is it this is a good community outcome moving forward and it does allow those the SES is to actually invest in where they are and to remain where they are and to remain as part of the community and yeah I like this idea I think it 's a good workable idea just a comment if there 's no further questions do we have a mover of the motion thanks counselor Tina I think here counselor tui seconding speakers to you sort of just said what you were going to say yeah councillor Tina yep any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor all those against Russian carried 7-1 yeah thank you Mr Cashman five point three point one capital works and landfill miss Michael thank you madam yeah this is really the companion report to there from the finance report that was presented earlier by these columns as she explained and we like to give you a little bit more information around the capital program so it 's for the same period and you 'll find a lot of this information is actually in the secretary financial report as well I read just summarizes a little more for you it 's been a busy half year and this report gives you a summary of the movements and the forecasting for the program in that pool six months and then the movements within the program for the last three months and six to you to adopt the report as council is very aware it 's been a very big program that we are attempting to deliver this year somewhere around the 50 million mark the current forecast that we expect a a 50 1.6 million dollar program and that is where the budget is sitting at the we expect that in the next quarter there will be small additional changes to that forecast importantly and pleasingly to report that we 're currently saw at the end of some December we were sitting at fifty-five percent of the total budget either being commissioned via contracts and purchase orders or actually expended so we 're sitting significantly higher than we were at this time last year they 're still quite a way to go with that budget but we 're looking at expenditure of twelve million dollars and a further sixteen point seven million dollars of commitment which gives us a total of that are we twenty eight point seven million dollars which are in a normal year would be almost our entire capital program that we 're sitting at a bigger program this year within the program there 's been a number of carry forwards to next year and we 've tried to carry forward five program projects and we 've also tried to balance that off with bringing some of the projects that were scheduled to the next year back into these private things like the Aqua dome where we 've got a plan a scheduled outage it makes sense to bring some to B so we have now looking at the program we have a total of 187 projects up slightly from the last time we reported on it at a hundred ninety one significantly we 've had movements within the program which sees us now with a holding account balance of just over two hundred thousand dollars so we 've been had some significant savings so I think you look at the report we 've had on savings you identified across 17 projects and then we 've had some reallocations to projects as well and that 's summarized in Appendix 1 in detail we 've also added some projects through the to the overall program some of that is about breaking down categories we have a row from your budget we 're now breaking that down into some of those more significant specific projects so we can accordingly and we 've also had a number of successful grant applications I think there 's a number I think it 's nine there that a new project for their identified fire grant funding so it 's a mix of both reallocations of budgets report is in front of you along with the two thanks miss waggle questions councillors councillor retainer that 's so much you alright not so much a question but just a statement thank you Fiona for the great work you 've done since you 've been in that office of project or the project management office the reporting that 's coming back is really good it 's informative and we 've we 've discussed that it audit committee and we 've noticed some improvements so thank you for your efforts in that area but also this is the bar gonna be ready for the mayor to cut the ribbon in Easter you know on the program that the bark is running to schedule not anticipating anything that 's going to mean that we can 't schedule so yes we are looking at them having some sort of a soft opening and then having a more formal opening later in the year but it is still on schedule for an April hoping it looking pretty good can I just interrupt sorry miss Vogel counts the pelts and I 've just read but there 's an item here saying reseal buckin or bossed Road and I live on that road I 'd like to step out and of the possible conflict of interest I think it 's fair to the community that I don 't make it easy Thank You councillor pouts sorry for the interruption so with the park program it is um it 's whimper places on schedule it 's very close to budget it 's a largest single project in the budget thank you thanks mr. Halton counselor II just a comment in regards to the design mode funding for the Cenotaph which really thank you if there 's no further questions do we have a mover I think was counselor tui a seconder accounts Laura Tina I thank you any further speakers to the motion no there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor motion carried unanimously seven thank you thanks miss Walker module number six surgeon and other business he doesn 't have to go can you open the doors back up we 're still in an open business thank you I 'd like to bring to the attention of council an item called the Linda no Valley water security project and I 'd like to move a motion that counsel advocate for a copy of the 2018 feasibility study undertaken by Southern rural water so we can better understand the implications and options for this critical Linda narrow Valley horticultural industry this is important to our region because six of the top ten seller produce in Australian located right here in the window Valley directly 120 million dollars revenue of product comes out of the lino Valley and a further 250 million dollars of value added product comes out in Noe Valley but most importantly and critical to our region is the 1,200 jobs associated directly with the vegetable industry and eliminate Valley thanks counselor Tanner do we have a seconder thanks counselor Roberts okay our further speakers if I can speak to it madam mayor these the reason you can 't sell retainers asking that this matter be introduced as a matter of and we 're not debating the matter or spoke to them the matter yet he 's we should admit it yeah as urgent another business so because I 'd like to speak against that because I can 't see one world a report where a CEO can just go and ask for it needs to be in a piece of urgent business at this late time of a Tuesday evening so that 's that 's why I wanted the process to be followed we have it a seconder to bring it to edge and now the business thanks counselor Roberts okay so the motion is now the reason I would like to have it as a formal motion I think it 's critical this issue 's been around for ten years and unfortunately only time it ever reads its head again is when we 're in drought and it 's too late so if I can get the support around the table that to have it as a fall motion I 'd be grateful thank you thanks cats the Roberts do you wish to counselor Ellis asking for the report it 's not the problem and I 'm quite happy to go along with that but really urgent business I can 't see why we as a council can 't turn to our chief executive office and say mister Bashford can you please ring your counterpart at southern rural water and ask that a copy of that report be made available for the reasons councillor retainer to have line I mean do valid enough but this is not urgent another business you know this is something that could be just handled on a routine matter I seem to mare to speak to being in her office tomorrow morning asking CEO to do something like this yeah the points he 's got they 're all valid not a problem but this is not really an urgent business this is not something kind of turn the organization over or it 's so critical that a diatou can 't pass without us getting that information and I 'm sure southern rule would be more than happy to do that I don 't I 'm not involved with the council return I know some secret well some issue you know in water politics that we 're not aware of but are tougher than I think local government you look at the murray-darling I say council let 's think about this but there 's no real urgency with this and that see I just be requested and did he just ring and get the dam any other speakers in my house say something well if we deal with it quickly nad we just deal with and now get it done that 's my suggestion and then we weren 't able to go back to it okay so I 'll put it to the vote that this be submitted under urgent and other business all those in favor all those against motion carried six-two thank you okay the the motion is now on this table so would you like to speak to it further councillor retainer no I don 't want to hold people up but look really just to put this into perspective if it 's supporting what councillor White said tonight the irrigate is out there are on stage night stage ten there 's no more water there 's 1,200 jobs tied up with that industry directly and indirectly now at risk involve and do you think it would be urge another business because I 'm putting in perspective as to why it should be urgent another business thank you I turned for a write a reply on that last comment well it 's because I think that I 've moved the motion sorry I seconder to speak okay speaker against the motion I 'm only just going to say look that last coming has counseled the routine eyes it 's a bit emotive let 's get that let 's get let 's let 's get the let 's get the report and then analyze it and see what it tells us and what we can do to assist our our horticultural industry I 'm not against getting that the report I just don 't think we need the emotion can 't flip outs yeah no I would like to see them the southern rural water coming in addressing us and giving this presentation on it so that we can have a cross-table discussion about it and I do I wish she had have said before that it about the more relevant to my vote because I didn 't actually yeah well I I just didn 't put two and two together when you put it there because you 've put a few things up tonight particularly which you don 't haven 't ever done in the past and you 've just thrown them at us at the last minute so what I wasn 't near was I yeah would have been nice to have received a bit of warning that 's all it 's count four II just I just like to make a comment the the fact is that people who who are not able to farm if we go to level 10 restrictions that is highly emotive for those people out there and for people who rely on those jobs that for an income so it is councillor else it is an emotive thing and I say that because I used to live out there and I know a lot of people out there and it 's that is that is the way it is we 've accepted under other business thank you any further speakers okay you okay motion carried can I have someone unhappy for counsel will now close the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 89 2d of the local government to consider items 7.1 and 7.2 as these items relate to contractual matters thank you yeah it 's not confidential they we keep general business we don 't have a general business item we were urgent another business okay I think we did move into camera yes so the stream you should stop unless _"

counselor Ellis any further speakers councillor retainer thank you madam mayor I was speaking in favor of the motion that 's been put on the floor now I believe this will give this the best opportunity to get through and I hereby support the motion thank you thanks counselor tyno if there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is 2018 p application for a 2 lot subdivision to exercise an existing dwelling at 1090 Deptford Road Clifton Creek and we have courtney Campbell who wishes to speak to the item thanks miss can we have five minutes thank you better me counselors stuff I 'm a bit sorry bit thrown by the last one I have got my head around that yet and unfortunately this application has taken a long time sorry speaking against the planning permit application for a to lot subdivision at 09 zero Deptford Road Clifton Creek for two lot subdivision unfortunately it is the processing of this application is taking an extremely long time there 's been a very little action on this application since October of last year and the application was lodged on the 7th of September or referral response is received by the 11th of October a detailed assessment is undertaken in February and now here we are six months later I understand that this type of subdivision is not favored by some of our council officers at the moment there is however the ability to allow this type of subdivision and a need to consider each of these type of subdivisions on their merit and to assess the site and the farming ability on a case-by-case basis the lands under lighting in nature and has large put large patches of vegetation that limit the areas that can be used for grazing the proposed subdivision creates a nineteen and a half Hitler allotment with the existing house that would continue to be used for grazing this lot will have access to suitable rural infrastructure including water stockyards and he 's in divided into grazing paddocks the balanced allotment will have rights for a house to be built on as it is greater than the 40 hectares and whilst it is claimed that the land will be lost to farming in this instance the potential development of an additional house mainly is a couple of hundred square metres however the significant investment in infrastructure and intensive use of Agriculture could be gained not many farming enterprises within East Gippsland other sole income for families anymore particularly now during this severe drought most people I have a secondary income so the need to retain aim is to maintain and improve rural production which in some founding areas is easier and larger land holdings do support them however in this this is not the case here clearing the land of vegetation will ultimately improve the rural production however I don 't think this is a desirable outcome I agree with the objective in seeking to protect and enhance our viable and high-quality agricultural land now snowy and mutual River flats the large thousands of hectare land holdings at the back of the areas that are remote and play a direct role in the agricultural industry of East Gippsland this land is not prime or high-quality agricultural land the planners report states that Lots in this area range between two hectares and 100 hectares and lots containing Billings generally do not have an agricultural component we are providing the ability to have both a dwelling and an agricultural use on each of these two Lots in relation to the bushfire management over late the CFA have as much responsibility as the council as they and they have provided consent to this proposal all in all this into the agricultural economy of East Gippsland the subdivision is not out of character for other lot layouts and land holdings in the area we respectfully request an alternative motion be put forward to grant a permit thank you thank you miss Campbell miss rennolds do you wish to speak to the item thank you thank you this is a planning application that is seeking to use a provision of the farming zone it 's a farming zone property of which there are three opportunities to make an application for subdivision this is a application that is using applying to use the clause that talks about an excision of a dwelling in this the incidence it 's creating a to lot subdivision the dwelling to contain the existing dwelling major dam and farming to infrastructure with a 19 hectare lot allotment and an approximate 57 balanced allotment essentially the recommendation before you councillors is that we as planners have taken taken the arguments with respect to the premise of the application in this case there is no compelling reasons and benefits presented as part of the application to the ongoing the two lot subdivision furthermore what we are saying is that the subdivision results in the fragmentation of land and by doing so it 's creating another dwelling in the rural landscape the purpose of the farming zone is quite specific that it names to support and enhance the farming farming of the land what we 're saying is the fragmentation will lead to not not to it not does not support necessarily another agricultural pursuit of the land we are saying that it 's a rural residential outcome the the council report talks about what the definition of rural residential outcome and it 's about a lifestyle opportunity the creation of a balanced allotment greater than 40 hectares creates a allotment greater than the schedule the schedule to the farming zone in this case grants are right to use the balanced land for the purposes of a dwelling use is granted by the nature of the number of this of the balance slot in this case a planning permit would be triggered to consider the issues but in it but the use is is it is as of right property that we consider has grazing opportunity there is no basis for the proposal that any intensive agriculture is to commence or any reason why a smaller lot is is considered to be of merit I take you to the decision guidelines in the planning scheme and essentially it 's very important that I say tonight that just because a permit can be granted or that we can apply for a permit it does not apply that we should grant a permit in this case we are saying that local policy relating to agriculture in our local planning scheme actively discourage the creation of rural residential lots for this reason we are proposing six grounds of refusal and we believe promised on being inconsistent with the purpose of the zone and inconsistent with our local planning policy relating to agriculture thanks miss rennolds questions councillors councillor Buckley thank you very much there 's an alternative recomendation exists in this case have we prepared one thank you Thank You councillor Buckley know an alternative recommendation has not been prepared why so why wasn 't why was it mentioned by Courtney Campbell with councillors where we advise councillors of the applications coming forward to council and and provide them with a review of the matters at hand Council do not suggest or request for an alternative formation on this manner be prepared Thank You councillor 2e thank you madam mayor an excision from from what I have seen and known of over the years that is a generally accepted process but from what I 've seen over the years an excision usually involves a very small parcel of land is is that what and the the ability to exercise a property off is that what that 's about Thank You councillor Chui for your question excisions historically have often meant a small a lot small a lot in the definition is less than 40 hectares but in our practice it less than 40 is the answer in you know in the past lots are usually in the order of that two hectares a small a lot as opposed to to the 90 when I say usual they 're usually small smaller than than the nineteen notwithstanding that there will have been situations a recommendation before us councillors do I have a mover thanks counselor Chui seconder do we have a seconder I 'd like to move an alternative any natus what 's your alternative motion I 'd like to do we need to let councillor to his motion lapse I would like to to move that the application be approved that they 'd be granted okay can I just please refer this to miss Bennett for clarification Oh mr. hollow madam mayor if you if motion was paused to grant a planning permit in this case the motion should be supported with a range of conditions so that procedural and technical requirements of the sub-divisional act and playing environment act can be met as well as obviously practical and sensible matters we have none tonight pre-prepared so we would be required to maybe be provided with some time to prepare up as suitable motion counselor of it could I request that we defer it until the next ordinary council meeting you can 't mister Hollow can you please clarify whether that 's possible yes that 's possible moment on procedural processes the I was in the process of seconding it when an amendment oh I took of it jumped in where does that leave the application as we are now because so I would have thought it was left on the table miss Bennett are you able to cannot through you marry me can I just clarify did you actually second if I may could I confirm through you met Emir with counsel to II whether he wishes his his motion to go ahead or whether he was planning to withdraw now I 'm I 'm happy to withdraw given the reaction in in the chamber so counselor Robert says move to defer the item counselor Pelt so seconded I 'll put it to the vote to the next council meeting which is cheese day counselor pelts house second it councillor roberts can you please speak to your motion as to why you have asked for it to be deferred considering the large excision roomate and the exercise land would remain at 40 hectares I don 't believe it would be detrimental to to the two planning outcomes considering the quality of I think it 's fair to the applicant that it be considered for the reasons that I just mentioned thank you miss Bennett thank you Robert I think it would be useful for the sake of the let the record reflect and for clarity if you were prepared to include in your motion that the matter be deferred so that officers have an opportunity to thank you I would like to also clarify that the reasoning that I would like to request to move that this this item be deferred till the next available ordinary council meeting is to give officers time to to formulate an appropriate recommendation that meets all statutory and administrative requirements a recommended I request a recommendation for approval to be considered to the next ordinary council meeting we got there thank you mr. Howe I do wish to through you madam mayor the officer recommendation remains as put I think what we 're looking at is a request to prepare an alternative motion to support the application councillor Roberts is that what you 're asking for that is correct Thank You mr. hollow mad at support of councillor Roberts as quest on the grounds that 192 oh hang on seventy eight hectares actually is equivalent to 192 acres and the 40 hectares is equivalent to 98 acres and it gives me thought that it 's actually an appropriate subdivision whilst it may be some of it may be covered in you know dense forest or treed the bottom line is it is still a viable grazing property and I think the applicant actually has merit and there is a right for him to be able to subdivide his property and still be able to have a 40 hectare property which is 98 acres and I believe it 's above and beyond the request of the state governments of the state the state government 's guidelines have been 40 acres so I think there 's actually merit and I would like the officers to have a look at what they are recommending and the alternative to be considerate of the applicants wishes on being able to possibly develop his property to how we request Thank You councillor ratinho thanks madam I 'll just like to quickly of area or land use strategy I just couldn 't support the recommendation I was presented either night but I 'm supporting the motion to defer you know there 's precedence that we have approved this type of subdivision before and not that that sways me but in the absence of air or land use strategy I can 't support the previous one and I am supporting councillor Roberts motion Thank You councillor Ellis someone has to oppose the application so it 's me I think yes usually morning the situation is councillors we were presented with these briefing papers previously we have gone through and read through these issues we have discussed them and challenged offices in relation to their recommendation the office is in good faith and complying with their role have presented these documents for us to make a decision on this evening we should have been able to make a decision on this matter tonight the planning rules are clear in relation to this government direction from the State Planning Officers very clear in relation to these matters these exercises are not unusual we do get decisions and I believe that we should as a council have been in the position to make a decision on this this evening and therefore I must oppose this application for deferral thank you madam me any further speakers councillor Roberts do you wish to have a rider of require no I 'll pass thank you I 'll put councillor Roberts motion for deferment to all all those in favor those against motion is carried five three five point one point three East Gippsland Shire Council propose seats priority projects its waggle Thank You Madame mountain roads and connectivity a paramount as a very important to the East Gippsland child community I 'm very important therefore to council both as a provider of nearly 3,000 kilometers of roads ourselves and also as an advocate on behalf of our community for road improvements and provision of roads where the responsibility lies with other agencies wearing our advocacy hat we have been a member of the South East Australian Transport strategy group otherwise known as seats for a number of years and indeed council appeals currently chairs that group that group develops of Australia and need some strong adverse secret group for those priority projects over the years we 've had a number of projects that have been on that priority list and have since been now implemented or upgraded or and there has been an outcome seats is in the process of reviewing their strategy and their lists of priority projects and we 've been asked to nominate projects for that group again we have put forward 12 projects for council to consider tonight they 've been based on three selection criteria around Road Safety economic benefit and connectivity we 've also further and prioritized symptom we 've identified some of those projects that are ready for investment or shovel-ready and others that we consider are ready for further planning work so the recommendation and these are provided to you as Appendix 1 the recommendation for council tonight is that our council endorses these proposed priority projects so that we can provide them to seeds thank you thanks mr. wykel questions councillors I happy to put forward the nation by laying before take a council met him in thanks council Alice council Alice simply put put the matter to councillors to support and refer you to the list that has been provided for us they are all been on the table with council for quite some time Oakley I 'm glad to see that one of my babies the scriveners tract likes entrance is mentioned I should say that while I 'm here and a number of other important recommendations the seats is a particularly important organization and I 'll allow councillor we do refer to that organization in his words but I fully commend this motion before you to council thank you thanks counselor Ellis councillor II thank you madam mayor having recently attended seats up in New South Wales in in council opposes place I was made very aware of the importance that that seat plays in the in advocating for for road improvements from Canberra down across the eastern corner of our country across to western Victoria and this this list here I think does truly represent some of the priorities that we see here and that will be will be pursued by that organization and and put on the works that need to be done in preferably air area but but all areas of the state so it 's a this this is a good list with some some very opportune and very important upgrades so I I 'm happy to happy to support this proposal thank you thanks counselor Tory councillor Buckley just a quick question this Calhoun Road come under the seats program the one that goes up from here to up to the frozen road lapels do you wish to speak to the motion and perhaps you can clarify I might enlighten you if I may councilor Buckley the seats is the southeastern transport systems and basically it 's all roads and ports and airports within the East Gippsland region and within all of the 16 other council member regions as well so it goes from Wollongong all the way down to ball ball and it covers all roads and rail and airports everything so if it 's a Delp road and it 's in the Cahoon it will come under our seats delegation and it will be a local road but it will projects list such as this it will be recognized it 's the only way it will probably be recognized because it is very well respected the seats group within the political circles both federal and state government look towards us for for funding opportunities to help the region 's so with with that said I 'd like to say Fiona thank you and Mark who 's been helping thank you for hoping this list because for a long time I 've been involved with seats for the past 11 years and I look at the lists from New South Wales and I get hundreds of thousands of dollars for road upgrades in their regions purely because they get them on these seats lists and we 've been a bit reserved over the years and the Victorian sectors always light on and whilst we 've actually you know we 're getting to the point in our end of our old list it 's great to be seeing new projects identified that would improve travel and you know holiday tourism destinations you know for people to be travelling within our regions and these safety upgrades and improvements because our area is predominantly hilly and with a caravan on it 's quite difficult for some of the elderly to be driving around our region so any upgrades we can campaign for I think it 's a real bonus for our area so with that said I commend that more councillors support this list so we can get it recognised with some decent funding for our region any further speakers with that said I 'll put the motion to all those in favour motions carried 8-0 5.2.1 regional and district event sponsorship round to 2018 2019 assessment I wish to declare a conflict of interest and as such will ask councillor white to chair this portion of the meeting thank you madam mayor but to welcome mr. John Norton to the table and if he would go through their proposals and those who have been successful and discuss who 's going to get given some of these funds Thank You mr. Morton thanks very much good evening counselors counsel as you know we 've been running the roads program for a number of years successful program particularly through the rides side of things which specifically relates to regional and district events during that time with with supported council supported an extremely large number of events during that time during the current year so the 2009 financial year we 've supported events totaling around 91 thousand dollars those events have been spread throughout the region and also have we 've been able to bring an additional 12 new events during that period to the region some of many of those have been over a three year period as well which is great that we 're seeing that that economic benefit coming to the region this year for the second round of rides for 2018-19 we received seven applications for funding and these a number of these do stretch out for the the out years up to 20 21 22 offering a good spread of events throughout the region again which is great and we 've also had a number of applications from as far widespread his ankles rest which is great so there 's a number of those friends of meter the Ben soccer club keeps them which is formally the s keeps that food cluster victim classic the Pineville classic boat rally and the open links regional Community Development Association so those in total 37 and a half thousand and the the hopefully they will continue to encourage regional growth throughout throughout the Shire Council is a recommendation before you receiving for consideration in relation to the round two of the Oh tone on tone rides happy to take any questions mr. Morton this is very they you get no no we 're we got it 's just a quick question the G bunk all Polo Classic is but which is to be held at cabin crustacean I know was traditionally sponsored and managed over in Alpine shy can you tell us how we go were able to entice them to come over into the the East Gippsland shorter I thought it was a permanent matter on their calendar Thanks cancel no let 's speed question so you 've we 've been in discussions with the the Alps think community up there and also the AH the Alpine char have had a bit of I think they see it as because Kabongo falls in our region that fits with us a little bit more and we were very forthright in obtaining that event so it 's another one that would be able to get it 's very very successful event over the last so yeah it 's a code word for us to have time Thank You deputy made now their location where they headed up at the paddock you know where the dinner well it 's the awesome Mount Hotham airports the official name for it I used to hold it there and because of the development there of the runway the area became restricted and it wasn 't such a popular spot where his Kabongo was quite the opposite and the proprietors at Kabongo station were very helpful and wanting it to go there and it 's been there for a little while now and horse airplane was the name of the original spot where it was well that 's not quite big enough to be called a plane now except for airplanes so worked and there 's not many of them much mr. deputy me thank you for the history lesson councillor Buckley and now we have a an impatient counselor Roberts wishing to ask a question Thank You deputy Thank You mr. Morton i noted of the seven requests for funding request number seven the east gippsland beef conference was the only one that was not in the recommendation despite the the description the comments and description noting that it 's been quite quite successful in previous years is there a reason while that was a meet at this time around was and things to be questioned caster Roberts so the escape sent both conference in the past has been run through a committee and this year the application actually came to council through the department of jobs precincts and regions and it was felt when we were discussing it that if council was to fund that through this program back to a state department that there would be some concerns around that however in saying that we have had subsequent discussions with that group and we will be supporting the event through other means counselor tyno I 'm happy by Councillor Rotato seconded by Councillor buckley would you like to speak yes sir I 'd just like to thank the officers for preparing the report it this is an excellent way for get seed funding yet particularly new events or emerging events and as you rightly put mr. Morton that does give then those events leeway to either springboard off what they 've done or source of the types of funding so it 's a really important piece of work that we do each year and thank you and commend you for the work done here tonight thank you Thank You councillor now counselor Buckley would you like to respond I think I 've covered it fairly well thank you any speak as a guide just thanks for that okay nice because again stop with this motion to the vote please all those in favor unanimous thank you councillors and I would expect that they are me and my return to the chamber five point three point one amendment to council meeting schedule 2019 miss Bennett mr. CEO thank you madam mayor this is a procedural matter essentially we August and September simply swapping the dates over so that we can have the August meeting in omiyo due to the fact that we have external people in particular the auditors coming to the meeting insert in September which would have made it problematic so I there 's a recommendation there for council to to consider and I would put that to you to move the motion madam it 's procedural thanks counselor Ellis thanks counselor T no no speakers no put that motion to the vote all those in favor motions carried unanimously thank you five point three point two instrument of delegation Council to chief executive officer procurement of insurance miss Bennett Thank You counselors this report is seeking your approval to amend the CEOs delegation to exclude the the purchase of specified insurances from his delegation which limits the amount of money or the amount of goods works and services that can be acquired to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars it 's basically an operational issue in that because of a range of factors including the process it needs to be followed and the timing of a number of other councils means that we are seeking we are looking to raise the purchase order to purchase these insurances public liability products liability professional indemnity and special industrial risks at a period that 's normally at the end of or early in in July if if we are given the report on these tenders a little late it means that potentially we might go for the whole month of July without having a live insurance in place through this amendment to the delegation which is quite specific in that it is only insurance that is exempted from the delegation we will overcome that problem and ensure that we have appropriate insurances in place 12 months of the year thank you thanks miss Bennett are there any questions counselors happy to move it madam mayor sorry counselor pouts just to clarify so that we know exactly what we 're adopting here I 'm trying to work out the insurances that you 've said are they listed in table on on the page 49 in that table where there was three hundred ninety three thousand five hundred and ninety just clarify that that 's the total the four insurances together correct they are all paid at the same time I guess why the amount is so high so if they were all individually listed at their own amount it had actually come to his delegation amount potentially yes but that 's not the way the package is presented to us it actually comes as a package so the amount that we 're actually talking about is it 's probably slightly higher than three hundred and ninety three thousand five hundred and ninety three dollars yes it would be and it would increase annually in CPI or something whatever market factors yeah sure okay so we 're looking around the four hundred thousand dollar figure plus GST yes potentially you would be looking you would be looking around that figure this year but if if for example a cap was set on the excess we 'd be back next year seeking a further increase can i just state I think I recall the same issue happening last year and we had to do it we had to do this process increasing the chief executive officers delegation of looking at this in some other way so that we don 't have to go through this process again next year because we will be the purpose of this report is actually to position us so that we don 't have to do this again what we normally have to do is scramble a report to you quite in elegantly sometimes because the notice is so short to get your specific approval to enable us to acquire the insurance by increasing the CEOs delegation what we 're hoping to do is that not having to scramble back to a council meeting or call a special council meeting specifically for the purchase of procuring these insurances so to make it clear to all of the councillors around the table what we 're adopting tonight by if we accept this recommendation is in to perpetuate tree we are stating that the CEO of our deli of our of our business is able to not have to come back to us to to be able to get the permission to adopt our insurances given the fact two thousand of four hundred and ninety three thousand five hundred ninety three for the nineteen twenty year or there abouts so the four hundred thousand dollar figure there abouts plus GST which is four hundred and forty thousand dollars yeah essentially what you 're doing counsel is he 's saying that regardless of the cost of these insurances and it is these specific insurances the CEO can can purchase or acquire those without requiring a resolution of council I think it 's worth noting counsel and and it 's a point that 's often overlooked that these figures or the ambit figures are included in the budget so by approving the annual budget you are effectively authorizing the expenditure not the CEOs expenditure but the expenditure on these insurances so what we 're looking for here is an administrative tool through which when we are advised the amount of money that we 're required to pay we can do that without having to wait for the next council meeting or call a special meeting of the council it is possible if it would make councillors more comfortable you could council meeting indicating that the insurance has been acquired and the amount of money that was expended in doing so and I 'd also just make the point that this is a very common practice and neighbors at Wellington for example have exactly the same arrangement and a number of councils throughout Victoria councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor I believe my question was answered in in the officers comments thank you any further questions councillor Pelt 's sorry can I just ask with regards to this whilst we this particular insurance is a package deal which is put through the nav Insurance Scheme and so if we were to be giving delegation would it be specifically only the fact if the MA V Insurance Scheme was being purchased or if another insurance body came along and put in a better price would the CEO then be able to to go and just spend it on another insurance body I 'm just trying to check if the wording yes the CEO would be able to acquire the insurance from any insurance company provided it had all the necessary licenses attached be acquired and I would counsel against tying it to the nav because every I think it 's every second or third we actually go out to the more general market the provider that we have been using for the past several years has brought back the most competitive bid which is why we use them but we 're not wedded to them so it could change from year to year counselor Ellis really didn 't have a question till I thought about what just been discussed and that is that with this particular thing it would remain with the co-ceo to make any decision in terms of the procurement of those particular insurances without having a need to report to Council have I read that right I think I 'd repeat my earlier comment that by adopting the budget Council actually approves the acquisition of the insurance what this does is simply put in place a mechanism whereby that procurement can be made more expediently but yes the CEO has the ability to acquire these particular insurances from the the provider that in his assessment and the assessment of what was just a quick question yes I just got it in time basically though I guess this time next year when this is going to happen would we just be informed of what the deal might be not that we needed to vote on it but would we still be informed that we you know what out what our insurance bill would be and who it would be with again the so through you madam me the estimate would already have been identified in the budget and therefore is available to all to see we wouldn 't normally report back on it on a procedural matter such as this one but you know I 'm sure the CI would be amenable to that if counselors felt that was something that needed to happen could I perhaps suggest that that we move it but to include a note that we are informed once the decision is made so the if I could add a point five to the motion as written that would suggest that upon receipt of said insurance the council is informed what the arrangements are thank you so we can be clear be comfortable with 0.5 counselor to e 0.5 he 's there could I make a suggestion through you madam mayor that there 's something to the effect of upon receipt of insurance and councilors provided a report when the when the outcome is known like arrangements are channel mark upon receipt of the insurance on upon receipt of the insurance policy that counsel is yeah miss Bennett is that clear to you what you need to do no and I don 't think it would be clear to any other reader I think what I would like to do through you madam mayor is clarify what we intend is here I thought when we started the discussion that the intent was that once the insurances had been paid that councilors would be advised is that where we 're going yes so not not necessarily on receives the insurance but on payment yes so could could I suggest then that the delegation is conditional on councilors being informed of the councillors being formed no no because it 's all about the premium so really the councilors so something along the lines that the delegation is conditional on councillors being advised of the premium paid no that has been paid is conditional on counselors being advised of the amount of insurance premium paid I have an instrument delegation you know I should call it happy with that as an amendment madam a mr. CEO and miss Bennett is the 0.5 queer counselor do you wish to speak to the recommendation thank you madam mayor not not really to add much again it 's a it 's a procedural issue that obviously does go over the delegation but in my opinion as long as we 're made aware of what that is that I don 't have any particular issue with thanks madam mayor just quickly your instrument delegation is obviously built on trust and this is just part of that and if anything happened we 'll then we renew the or review the delegation it 's pretty simple we 'll briefed thoroughly on this issue I 'm happy with it and I 'm happy to vote now Thank You councillor tanner any further speakers I 'm really rewording has come from the issue that we had the same issue last year the year before any year before so this will get rid of that issue of it coming back to the table for us when it 's an unconditional must pay the insurance must pay you know accounts must pay the insurance of liability totally so I think this is a good outcome Thank You councillor Ellis madam are you calling for anyone to vote against this because against thanks this is a particularly important issue and it 's not the issue of the insurances it 's not the issue of providing counselors with a report after something 's done it 's the issue of the role of counselors it 's the role of taking responsibility for decisions and in management of counsel it 's what the people elected us for was to be responsible to account for the good management of counsel by not providing a delegation in this case you don 't take away from the integrity or the role of any of the council officers and particularly not of the CEO this is a too easy just to say right we will pass on this delegation that so means we can get away from a meeting a little bit earlier another issue will come along and that the same argument of relevancy will be put up by officers and again councillors will stand away from their their their legislative responsibilities this is not about the CEO this is not about the role it 's not about wanting to cause undue workers or pressures on council officers it 's simply an objection to the point an argument to the fact that the desire role to make decisions and it 's in relation to the management of counsel by just neglecting any and passing on delegations one after another you get to a stage where the relevancy of counsel in many ways is questionable and as all decision-making would be left with the officers I 'm not trying to make a man of mellow matter this but it is an issue about what is the role of a counselor in this case and for that reason not the issue of the insurances I must oppose this I 've put to you tonight and think about your individual roles why were you elected and what responsibilities you thought you should undertake in the role of a counselor that is reasons for objecting to this particular delegation thank you any further speakers can 't fortuity we should have a right of reply thank you madam mayor I must say if this is in regards to knocking off early we 're very bad at it it 's it to my way of thinking this is just creating administrative efficiency I would feel very comfortable in the knowledge that we would be informed if if there was a variation that went outside of what what the variations have been in the past I would expect that any large variation we would be informed of immediately and we would we would then make a decision I don 't see that we knew we really need to be looking over our CEO shoulder to ensure that the the premium that 's being paid is is appropriate as I say I would expect that we would be informed if at if it changed in favor all those against motion carried six to urgent another business is Neil I 'll ask for a mover to move into business I hope I move that council now closes the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 89 brackets to brackets dear the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item 7.1 to 7.3 as these items relate to contractual matters thanks counselor pouts we 've got a second off thanks counsel retainer all those in favor motion carried we now _"

Bruce Hurley and we look forward to hearing your presentation and there 's a just a timer there too yeah let you know that you 've got 15 minutes and we 'll hand over to you thank you thanks Natalie and welcome all to Lakes Entrance as necklaces I 'm Bruce Hurley and I 'm the president of the legs entrance action and development Association and appreciate little bit about leader and also the infrastructure priorities that leader sees for Lakes Entrance I guess to start on an optimistic note things are beginning to happen in Lakes Entrance leader looks forward to working constructively with the Shire on the backlog of infrastructure developments there 's some optimism in the town that the corner is being turned and Lakes Entrance is moving forward again during the last two years leader has welcomed the opportunity to present to the Shire and big roads and to have constructive relationships with their state and federal members information has flowed more freely from the child since the appointment of the new CEO recently VicRoads has regularly sought the views of leader and consulted with leader leaders determined as it 's the Lakes Entrance community to work together to rejuvenate Lakes Entrance to achieve this we need the support of all tiers of government including local government and to interact and to attract new private investments but first a little about what caused the largest town meeting in Lakes Entrance history last month many in the community were feeling that despite its idyllic population or tourist numbers retail outlets vacant key sites along the Esplanade vacant and an eyesore CBD footpaths in disrepair report saying the town looked tired and in need of improve that 's just doula straight just one aspect of that visually I 'll boot through these next two or three slides that is the CBD in the main foot part and lakes entrance so it 's not a particularly good look for the top tourists for the top holiday spot in East Gippsland people felt the town was not getting its share of infrastructure development by all levels of government nor tracting private investment this was all first highlighted in the town meeting in November 2014 chaired and facilitated by councillor dick Ellis last year after the number of Rica vacant retail sites in the CBD had risen to over 20 20 27 at the last count Darren Chester called a meeting to discuss what could be done attending the meeting also were Timbo the mayor at the time Joe ratinho business and community leaders sepsis all say a quick visual look at the what people will know does the town was not flourishing including to power from population centers lack of support from the Shire internet shopping threat of rising sea-levels booth and bypass businesses looking tired rundown infrastructure just to name a few there was also agreement that the town needed a strong United voice as was felt that there had been a lack of an effective lobbying voice for Lakes Entrance and so this is one thing that the town had control over so leader sought new members willing to be on the committee to lead a new direction and to revert and to revitalize leader a new committee of leader was established in late February and set out to establish a strong voice for Lakes Entrance that would advocate for a much-needed facelift to the town new committee seven of them just moving around from left to right Ted hare Lord Bala John Butler Col Mike angkatell Jeff Wilson Sara Carlisle and Alison Brewer missing from that was my so posting the photograph and Peter syndra is in the second second row over on the right is the ninth committee member so seven of the then also new on the committee the new committees initial goals were to increase its membership listen to the priorities of the community and established constructive forward-looking relationships with all tiers of government and relevant government authorities leader believes these goals have been met illustrated by an increase in membership from 40 to over 430 frequent communication with the community by the press letter drops and a monthly newsletter and in addition regular meetings with the show.i down Chester and VicRoads in the communication with other government authorities and now well-established back to the town meeting called last month 320 people attended because of their concern for the town and because the meeting had been promoted as forward-looking not just a wind session the residents want to work together with the shire other tiers of government and private investors to get lakes on the move again so where to from here first leader believes it can now speak on behalf of Lakes Entrance businesses and residents of the town there 's a large broadly-based membership with the committee elected by its members as such we believe is now appropriate that on those matters listed by leader as priority new infrastructure developments leader also believes we should have X access to relevant documentation that address these development priorities put simply the community once it 's voice heard and wants to influence its future secondly leader wishes and intends to help set the agenda for current and future infrastructure developments but drawing upon the feedback received by the businesses and residential community in doing so leader has noted questions and discussions at the Town Meeting analyzed the survey circulated at the Town Meeting and made available online and viewed comments and suggestions made via emails and membership application forms from this process leader has set infrastructure development priorities there were no surprises here as in the main these priorities agreed with the list established at and after the 2014 Town Meeting first a comment on Jimmy 's point lookout before listing the priorities the development of the new journey to meas point viewing platform to replace the existing viewing platform has already received funding and a time table so it 's play its place to see this and is pleased to see not included in the priority list in saying that leader notes that there 's still work to be cheap with the viewing platform concept including the development of plans for both the existing lookout site and Rotary Park leader understands that this work is underway and requests that a leader representative be invited to join the group responsible for the design and implementation of this iconic structure leader believes as for the projects that needs to be consulted at the beginning of the design process and not after key design decisions have been formulated or made so now returning to the priorities priority number one and there 's all no surprises the improvement in development on Bullock island priority number two improvement and development on the foreshore and Esplanade and related projects such as the town square the slipway in the speed priority number three improvement in development on walking trials and the constructive use of fifty five farmers Road that 's being used well tonight priority number for improvements in development on further work at Rotary Park indoor recreational facilities landscaping along marine parade upgrading a Mechanics Hall possibly improved dog off leash arrangements in setting these priorities leader is not suggesting that tasks be individually developed in the numeric order described above for instance some items with a lower priority may be able to be addressed early at times when finances and resources become available so just briefly on those the those top priorities priority one Bullock island the nectar the neglect of this popular prime recreational side needs to end for more surveys and feedbacks receiver leader the community is saying that bulla gaalan he stands out as a prime location in need of urgent attention as such leader considers this together with the Esplanade and for Shaw to be the town 's top priority potential for Bullock island to be optimized for tourists and the community is self-evident with its excellent water views marine life and waterways with birding activity in the frequent movement of seals and dolphins is already a favorite fishing and catch and crabbing spot the visitors I mean looking at the slide up there is interesting the the one on the left that was taken three years ago when three prominent citizens over to bulla Garland the jetty as you can see in this one as most people would know it 's a very pop that 's a popular fishing and crabbing spot the island holds great potential to create exceptional walks and bike rides as well as plenty of space for passive recreation not yet fully exploited is the opportunity to see the fishing industry in action and the now you met with the fishing gaff this morning buy fish hook the trailers have a seafood restaurant and established a marine education facility at Holiday times they are frequently more than 100 people on the southwest corner of bulla Garland despite the pothole gravel road lack of toilets in the appearance of a dump site bulla Colin has been the focus of many studies over the last 30 years all of which recognized this great potential that their island has as a tourist destination in a place for recreation for residents all of these studies detailed courses of action for its development the last concept master plan for Bullock Island 2015 rotary Lakes Entrance interpretive study 2012 Lakes Entrance foreshore management foreshore plan and during the 90s the gone Wonderland project and the 1987 lakes entrance for sure strategy leader understands that in the past improvements bula garland have been deferred because of complex issues associated with responsibility and funding of elements of the island leader understands that overall agreements have now been reached whereby the Shia will have overall responsibility for the management of the island with other authorities having specific responsibilities in particular dealt with the responsibility for the sea walls repair and maintenance leaders concerned that there 's no budget allocation for Bob bulik garland development in the shyest drop budget despite aspects of the development being low cost in the high priority the framework for the allness development is an immediate and urgent requirement leaders suggest the 2015 master plan for bulla garland which was endorsed by the council is an excellent starting point and should be updated taking into account and you mention responsibility state funding available for the seafood restaurant gives land ports committed to commitment to expand the jetty and fishing co-op lands in a budget submission we 've put that they needed needs years and we 've made suggestions in terms of those budget allocations they 're just indicative amounts priority to the cbt comprising the foreshore and Esplanade and the following projects the town square the slipway in the spirit the show 's 2016 CBD Improvement Plan talks about the history of ad-hoc developments the lack of aesthetic appeal in the CBD and how the community sees the town is tired and second-rate and need to restore a sense of pride there 's a clear need to improve the CBD and foreshore and make it more people friendly with improved walk bike ways and footpaths informal recreation and meeting places continuous shade and Avenue trees quality street furniture better signage improved pedestrian crossings and lighting and public art the CBD improvement leader acknowledges that some works and now underway with funding from thick roads and the Shire however despite repeated requests we have been unable to acquire planning documentation for instance that shows the precise extent and scheduling of the works that are short of time I 've got a long list of things that we 've requested so I 'll skip written report leader has developed detail ideas for the slipway Town Square in the foreshore and Esplanade and we want the opportunity to discuss these leader notes that there will likely be many more elements in the CBD development we acknowledge that work of this complexity involving so many elements will need to be closely coordinated but this reason we seek to have leader included in the implementation team as stated earlier neither can now rightly claim its place at the table as the representatives of the local community there are of course arranged for meetings of detailed technical nature that leaders involvement would not be required I just say the headings and unlimited that the priority three improvement to walking trails and a constructive use of 55 Palmer 's Road I guess I 'll just read that a couple of recommendations there the walking trails and in particular the fourth circuit The Esplanade marine parade the entrance circuit walk Jimmy 's point lookout circuit book and eastern beach circuit Borg leader has been highlighting the need for improvements for to these 4th circuit walks to the shop for two as well as doing an ordered the walks these commitments as yet have not been met that 's slide in 55 Palmer 's Road I 'm sure people have got a little bit of the history of 55 I 've got a little bit about private investment which I 'll skip over and then just finally leader will continue to update this paper between our regular meetings with the CEO and mayor of the show so as to help inform discussions of these meetings the more detailed paper will be forward to the CEO and mayor to form the basis of discussion prior to our next meeting on the 21st of June so thanks very much for your attention my apologies for going over a couple of minutes any questions from cancellous so thanks a lot thanks mr. Hilley we appreciate you taking the time to present on your new Association and congratulations on building it up to where it is today Thank You councillor Pelt 's thank you Bruce with regards to what you 've got listed there are we getting a copy will we receive a copy of community section and have some kind of idea on what direction you want to go and with your group I think yes yes I 'll send it we 've got two versions of this paper I 'll Cindy I can send them both through but that was I read from the shortened shortened version and then there 's a longer version that goes into more details some bad thoughts about each of the projects he did the long version I 'll send both versions through to Anthony and to distribute have you know this counts for what thank you madam mayor I 'd just like to say young well done in your presentation and that a point you made earlier I think has merit is that you and I agree with that the consultation needs to come before this before the planning stage with the community I think that 's a that 's a very good way to to provide the community with what they really want say well done no other questions councillor pups I 'm a curious statement which Bruce made was the fact that he believed that and I 've disliked that clarified clearly at this point from our staff members as to what that is going to be council has commenced discussions with the Department of Environment land for on planning about the future management of Bullock Island or the the balanced areas of Bullock Island but that is subject to council determining that they will in fact take it on and on what basis and that 's yet to formally come before council for a decision at this stage so that 's will partly answer the the question is why there 's nothing in the budget for Bullock Island because we don 't currently have the ability to invest in Bullock Island until that until Council decide that it is formally going to accept responsibility for that part and while my point was that I just didn 't want the community to be mislead with something that wasn 't probably fully in place at this stage and so that it 's clear that you fully know that we are not land managers or committee of management of Bullock Island thank you okay thank you very flight inc and we have Andrea Lane in attendance and just a reminder that you also have 15 minutes okay thank you thanks for having us here tonight my intention is to only give a very superficial overview of the work that 's gone into the float project but it 's been a three-year journey and I was encouraged to come along and give a bit of insight about that and and hope to form a stronger partnership I suppose with counsel and in developing this project because we think it 's a major asset to the community and I hope it 's a really positive story when you look at Lakes Entrance and the story that Bruce is told I guess we think floats something that 's really positive and has been a really successful model the float project was a small town transformation project funded by creative Victoria and managed by regional arts Victoria at Lake Tahoe 's beach we applied for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to transform our community with the idea of a floating art studio and this is the result of that project I guess I wanted to highlight that float hasn 't come out of nowhere we 've been doing community arts for a long time probably the last 10-15 years going way back to the fruit project the fruit project started probably when I came to escape zone really 20 years ago and dr. Elizabeth Blackwell introduced me to the joys of fruit bottling and I was immediately taken by the local knowledge that we had in our own backyards that was really being under acknowledged in our communities that experience of bottling fruit led to fruit breakfasts which really meant that we created conversations through gathering people around what we could could do amongst ourselves really with no funding just really with a belief that we all enjoyed each other 's company and that creative thoughts would flow from those conversations a small team of us embarked on a series of fruit breakfasts across all of escapes on this particular journey was funded by the Australian Council with a very small development grant way back then and really we just served apple fritters to all these communities and shared them in that process is really what continues to support us to this day we partnered with local projects like the Ruth and orange fair we just became an added attraction to what those communities were already doing so we were never competing for their attention we were just really trying to support what they were doing as an act of generosity as you can see we traveled to Castle as Swift Creek Nicholson Hobart Gumrah and and as I say that that really is our network that continues today from there we we got funding to build a fruit cart which became our fairly iconic vehicle from which we could serve fruit breakfast that 's Gary bullski who 's a Tambo upper resident he 's a blacksmith and a metal fabricator we took the fruit cart down to Northcote and we were on the 30 report serving the breakfasts and telling the story of the unique experience that you can have any skip saying once you get to know the people we developed a fruit brand we were very lucky to meet Jess John along the way I think she great eye for branding and became the person that drove our fruit brand which really has attracted a lot of tension a lot of attention locally but really across the state and the idea of the word fruit if that hasn 't become obvious is but really that we were talking about fruit but we were developing a journey to say that we could curate an experience in East Gibson we don 't have the infrastructure we don 't have the galleries but we do have the people and the goodwill and the generosity to be an amazing experience that as a traveler I look for when I travel and I guess that 's what we 're discovering that evolved into an event called Fruitvale at generally at Nicholson River winery that became a growing event that I see now expanding in things like the the feral festival that was a proven last week and the the forage feast that happened at Brewin a couple of weeks ago we were really lucky that Kosta happened to love us because we were talking his language and that really changed people 's had some gravitas you know that um he became a fantastic ambassador for what we were doing that was us at non goner with Dora Stockhausen and Marcos Foley at their gallery in Laguna we went on to create feasts and to create and to discover beautiful photographers like clear River I have to say all of our events have been documented by Clare she does it often for nothing we try to pay her when we can but she 's just been a fantastic recorder of all the things that we 've been doing we progressed to establishing a artists made travel Bureau in Docklands because we became part of the renew Docklands project we applied to have a space there which we were able to have for 20 a week and we really told the Gippsland story we inhabited that for about 12 months and I think it 's still a good idea that regional arts Victoria should perhaps be pursuing because people came and and discovered things they didn 't know about this region through us occupying that space and serving a lot of fruit breakfast there been really small scale we see ourselves as piloting these things we were never in it to make a mountain of money out of things but just to highlight the things that people didn 't know we 're here so of course with Crete in take hassle us we 've established a really great partnership with up at Rob Lowe Gees studio there for that one from there of course we didn 't establish foundry but I 'd have to say that we contributed to its establishment that 's been running for three years now as a shop in bends Dale that you probably all know just John 's the leader of that as well they turned over a hundred thousand dollars this year as an arts collective putting money in the pocket of local artists and is an amazing success story we applied for incubator funding that we partnered with rural councils Victoria I think they gave it 's about ten thousand dollars we did so much with it it 's unbelievable we were offered this space by clearly sand Joe Moulton live negotiated that so that we had and events and have musicians there and and again it 's that beautiful branding by Jess and her crew that actually presented this much younger vibrant image of East Gippsland that we think was totally different to what anyone had thought of his group saying before we ran a design competition or actually Neil Smith and I attend participated in the crunch programme which was run by the social traders to develop a business plan for a social enterprise around glamping in East Gippsland and part of that was looking for a camping campster I don 't know what to call it tent that could operate in the area that we 'd focused on which was the point hicks area to say how do we actually create these beautiful spaces for people to come glamping in in Far East Gibson the winner of that competition which we offered a 5,000 prize for attracted architects from all around the world submitting their designs they paid to enter which was really nice because the paying to enter meant that we could actually offer a 5,000 prize for the winning design which we we built the fruit pod which I have to say thanks to giant grass who won the design competition went viral and still travels the world as a beautiful example of of what communities can build when they put their minds to it so I guess that 's just to say you know I 've not even touched on the float story yet but I suppose I just wanted to say we 're not making this up we 're not imagining things we we do actually have some great outcomes we went on to apply for the float grant which to build on lake tires we were successful we designed it that 's the design team there Rory bolding Katherine Larkins Leni Hayes Francis Harrison Cameron Robbins and Josephine Jacobi with the model of the float way back when and while the build was happening we were creating an experience at the tavern cup which we called having Tuesday which continues today we meet every Tuesday at the tavern and we probably have around 50 participants who come each week along the way we we established what we called a in the local community that 's untapped Kathryn Larkins connections with the indigenous community was obviously crucial in informing these kind of partnerships Alain tarik is one of the best basket Weaver 's in the region Frank Flynn is a botanist Sara Carlisle with venture out means we 've established a kayak club so that we 're actually on the lake we 're not just looking at it from afar we engage people in learning and sharing skills and and really celebrating that Josephine Jacobi built a bee farm at camp science camp philosophy camp which we we run at various times to bring people to come and talk around what float can be I won 't go into the community details but basically to say it 's a curriculum for campus built by the community it 's not locked in in any way it 's been the outcome of what we talked about at Tavern Tuesday all this time the boat was being built on lake tires at fisherman 's Landing thanks to the support of the the Shire that council don 't keep saying ports were all incredibly Landing it was a major exercise and we also delivered a fantastic corroboree again thanks to Kathryn Larkins who has such great relationships that we were able to celebrate the launch of the vessel with the blessing of the vessel from aunty Phyllis and and the community we also ran an almanac exhibition out at Lake Tahoe sand if you don 't know Lake ties house you know it 's a very secret fantastic destination that we were really privileged to to be able to install an exhibition on the other side of Lake Ty 's house we walked there from the shores opposite the tavern we had a smoking ceremony and we had an exhibition installed in the house there and it was a fantastic event that we 're going to do again in February next year and of course we were wrapped to have glow back there with Gratton doing the leading the walk as well so I kind of skip over these a little bit but just basically to say the community are making art there they 're loving what we 're doing behind the scenes while better community to welcome the artist who 'll come and reside on the float vessel sandy Boswell of course Oh 18s guru Ric Jacobi we did eventually run out of money to on the boat construction it was a very expensive business and at that point the community really kicked in because all the people that we 'd brought along on the journey stepped up and finished the boat so we had you know retired builders electricians plumbers keep saying solder who donated the solar system for the for the boat we did put in some money we ran an adoption to raise the rest of the money but keep snow and solar made a considerable donation to that obviously we had lots of tradesmen and people and Joe was there and keep saying so lone skipper Pete 's been invaluable to our journey of course because without him we would often struggle to get from the boat to the shore and all those other places and certainly backing up kayak tours and things we had a welcome to country at fisherman 's Landing when we launched the vessel and that 's my recap on a very short history of float we 're now ready to launch we 've got a program for the next 12 months about the the artists who will be coming on board the ABC came to the launch and produced a beautiful video of of the vessel and and what we were anticipating to happen for the next 20 years because we do expect it to be there for at least that long as the results of that rotation on ABC News on Christmas Day and Boxing Day we 've got 200 expressions of interest we 've got 25 artists now lined up to be installed as artists in residence we 're in conversation with them it 's a little bit organic as we learn the process is a lot to learn about hosting artists and and understanding how to program that and their needs but everyone 's focused around the lake the environment their love of the space and so we 're looking forward to the next 12 months of that program and I suppose what prompted this presentation was really that although we beginning of the the story we hope that what we 've produced is a good model of community engagement in the arts and and that we 're producing great outcomes from that and that we can spread that right across the capstone Lakes I suppose is what we met with Kate and Anthony a couple of weeks ago to say we actually think we can do this in lots of places along this journey we 've met we 've heard of underused spaces places that only get used occasionally there are chronic destinations like Lake Ty 's house like banger Haven like the community space on Rigby Island I think rotamer you know places that we 're just hearing about that just using this model some people are prepared to donate their spaces to to the business model so that we can make sure as a social enterprise that we can remain viable but I also think there 's just a plain business model that people will just pay to come and have these kind of experiences in escape zone and that what we 're looking for is something that touch that actually says people want to come more for experiences than just seeing and actually taking part in it so I guess that 's kind of where we 're at at the moment and I have to say we 're getting a lot of it seems to be something in the zeitgeist I suppose that suddenly I 've received lots of proposals from other arts organizations around the state saying they 're thinking the same thing they want us to be part of this network that 's offering artistic excellence and relevance that tells people what a unique experience you have in regional communities and that the arts really helps make that happen has it thanks Andrea that was absolutely fantastic to hear of all the fantastic initiatives that you 've created with that group so congratulations are there any questions from the councillors can I just say congratulations I think it 's a really fantastic concept and I do liken it to those starting in the beginning of the mentions projects and I 'm thinking with that in mind that actually went worldwide so I 'm not sure I 'm only suggesting this it may be ideal to Paton the base of this at this stage so that there is a base concept to it because when I spoke with the people that started the men sheds back in because it was originally started in almost they wish they had a patent at back in those days and the guy that started it actually took it around the world and has made a living from it so I 'm only throwing it out there with regards to our economic development officers here it would be worthwhile them talking to you and putting you in that space to protect what you 've actually grown because it 's awesome concept and it 's fantastic thank you I guess it 's really an invitation to anyone who wants to find out more to come and talk thank you thanks very much Andrea autumn 1.8 public question time mr. CEO madam mayor we have no questions item 1.9 record of Assemblies of councilors report for April and May 2019 I think this council routine oh thanks counselor pouts all those in favor met the petition that is being tabled tonight was lodged with the deputy mayor Councillor John white on the 6th of May by mr. Allen Canterbury what the petition is seeking was for and I 'm quoting for counsel to stop the 12-point o 9% rate increase on agricultural land for the rating year 2019 to 2020 and to reduce council rates to significantly below the rating year the first of July 2018 to 30th of June 2019 levels because of historically falling agricultural land values since the petition was lodged Council released its revised draft budget which essentially reduced the anticipated 12 point oh nine percent rate increase back to two point four five percent so we contacted mr. Canterbury and asked whether he would still like his petition to go forward he indicated that yes he would so it 's tabled here tonight and in addition on the first of June mr. Canterbury delivered a second petition to councilor wise which unfortunately was received too late to be included in the agenda the petition is essentially the same and is really just mr. Canterbury noting that the the that rates be lowered from 2019 levels and that secondary petition was accompanied by approximately a hundred and seventy signatures so that information is tabled for you tonight there 's really no decision to be made that will be at the time the draft budget is considered so mr. Canterbury 's petition will be considered along with all other submissions received in relation to the draft budget but happy to take any questions thank you thank you through you madam it is the that 12% that said up or round about whatever it is twelve point something does that apply to the commercial establishments and and residential establishments does that apply generally or is it only just a farming land where this valuation has been increased by that seemingly amount enormous amount the twelve point oh nine percent was represented in the first draft budget Council released a revised draft budget that reduced that amount to two point five percent increase which is in in the same vicinity as the the rate for both the commercial and residential rating categories how can I sure it 's my understanding that the the shire suddenly drop the valuations when we didn 't put them on in the first place the twelve point oh nine percent refers to the increase in rating rather than the increase in valuations excuse me madam mayor but it seems very complicated to me to think that we 've got that it sort of puts us in double jeopardy doesn 't it you know where we can decide to do something that says basically that we can 't if you 're referring to the rates kept counselor which is where the state government mandates that the rates can only increase a certain percentage is that what you 're referring to her into that years well that way it seems an almost drop to bring it down from twelve point oh nine to two point whatever those figures don 't seem to register properly when you look at your actual rate notice it doesn 't seem to be a year something like a ten ten percent drop in the in the rates that you 're paying the right notice of of course haven 't_''_2744.109 issued so that 's a percentage amount that rates can be increased in a year is an average rate increase so depending on the air below of valuations and depending on counsels decisions through its rating strategy in terms of the three rating categories we have will depend on whether individual rate payers experience an increase a decrease or the rates stay the same and you 're quite right counselor on my fader is quite a complicated equation any further questions thanks counselor t no thanks counselor to e all those in favor motion is carried item 2 notices of motion or rescission mr. CEO Neal have been received met amir thank you im3 deferred business nice to see you there is no deferred businessmen Amir thank you item for councillor reports councillor Buckley better switch this on I attended the celebrations of well wave you 'd call them celebrations last Friday at the West End school with the reconciliation and it went over quite well and Joe 's probably got that in his reports I 'll leave that to you Joe and he was the other council that was there and the one that form a new committee for the Brune amber Hall would you believe and we were bit short on numbers so we got the mrs. schap we were holding the meeting in her shop so we put her on the committee as well and we managed to get four and anyway we just had a little bit of a tiny history stuff way back in the century before last the Victorian state government gave the hall people a hundred and eighty pounds and and fifty books to start a library and by the 1886 it got to 350 books and it was a free library open between 00 a.m. and 00 p.m. and a very old man on our committee now Barney Vince bender he says it was a free library all right because all the books disappeared and this was the century before last so thank you madam me thanks counselor Buckley counselor Ellis oh it 's difficult to follow councillor Buckland come back on won 't be as chamorro record won 't be as colorful madam me I just want to welcome all the members of the community here good to have the regional meetings now as a permanent fixture on our calendar it 's a that I mention I attended Bruce 's town-hall meeting and the mechanics Hall here in lakes it was most capably organized by the executive of Bruce 's group and their leader and it 's wonderful I 've been getting feedback on how the senior community groups moving along and to hear that they 've got in excess of 435 members genuine achievement and Bruce is to be congratulated while staying on topic it 's pleasing to revisit the sights of the major project councils working on around Lakes Entrance today and turn mind Council of the amount of work that we actually do do in this town the discussion and viewing of the opportunities of Jimmy 's point as a destination point was a genuine highlight today to be up there and look at the potential here I cannot tell you how pleased I was when I heard our local MP Darren start that he was quite amenable to looking at both the Jimmy 's Point side and the culling the hill site exploratory work on that particular project I 'm just going through at Rhonda not keep it all Lakes focus I 've also been meeting with other members of the Lakes Entrance community which I should mention because mr. Hurley raised one issue and that was the access to my strategic plans relating to Lakes Entrance as a result of conversations that I 've had with members of the community once again through the office of the chief executive officer I 've been Arnold to arrange for copies of those plans to be available for public viewing at the lakes entrance library and they are now out there and available they

large number of volunteers and those in particular who provide volunteer services that our Visitor Information centers across the Shire interestingly I attended the future local government workshops in Melbourne last week and what we 've experienced tonight is part of what the future of local government is presenting not only here in this country but in the UK and other members of the care Empire

it was was really great to to get out to some of these things where we these people owners featured well thank you thanks counselor counselor pelts councillor Roberts yeah I won 't bore the gallery this evening while I plug my laptop in thank you madam mayor Councillor Tina I think you met him man I just want to talk about a couple of things that for me is why I became a counselor and got involved with our communities I went to a workplace change the story and work ways have teamed up with correct employment and they screened at the Bentson cinema a series of change the story it 's a nationwide storytelling project celebrating ability and showing how our sustainable meaningful employment can change lives through the seven short films the project follows people across Australia who are changing the story around Disability Employment it 's a really a deep look into what navigating the world of work means through the eyes of people with disability I commend this great initiative people 's minds as to what is possible and achievable with an open mind towards a disability employment services Disability Employment Services like work ways locally dedicate resources to give one-on-one support and assist people along their journey to sustainable meaningful employment and changing lives also would like to urge my colleagues to maybe look at see employable me which is a series about the same sort of thing and also gives you an insight into the great work that Disability Employment Services provided in our community and changing lives even if it 's one life at a time that 's sort of augured well into the National Volunteer Week and I attended the breakfast counselor Ellis attended the event down here but this year 's national theme was making the world of difference and it was a great opportunity to celebrate volunteerism across East Gippsland if you think about volunteers and the important role they play in health and well-being of us all consider where we would be without them who 'd be delivering and serving meals on wheels to those in need helping children read at school fundraising supporters sport is accessible to all and supporting vulnerable creating art and cultural opportunities operating opportunities shops mentoring our youth and promoting our region and the list just goes on and on so he met her me once again I think on behalf of us all I 'd like to express a very big thank you to all our volunteers across our wonderful community that sort of finished the last thing I want to talk about is the Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club presentation night they do a really really good job and counselor Ellis was previously involved there and the discipline that 's shown by the young people within that organization in the way that they bring young people through it it was a fantastic presentation again and the patrolling hours that are done during this busy summer period down here at Lakes Entrance look it 's just mind boggling the amount of hours that are put in and I 'd like to thank the president and his team there for the patrol hours which have been recognized through the achievements and I 'd like to also congratulate Bela hotter for the great work they did in their young leadership and also recognized Jess Woodward who is the emcee for the night thanks madam mayor thanks counselor retainer councillor 2e thank you madam i i among the things i attended over the last month i must say that the the highlight for me believe it or not and this did surprised me i went to the cemetery signage opening now this is the cemetery in forged script road in band style i 've been lucky over the years that I 've never been there for any other reason than attending the the signage opening and I was astounded at what what the what the place is and what it looks like it 's it 's a beautiful place it really is a very peaceful place and what what the the organization has done up there is they placed ten signs around the cemetery that speak of of important people in our history which goes goes back to I think the earliest person up there was 1862 just wonderful to see and again along the lines of councillor ratinho our community whom we we would we would not do very well without volunteerism is alive and well in being style I saw it firsthand the pride that that the people take in what they do up there amongst all of the other things that people do in our communities is to be absolutely commanded and that 's part of the reason why it was the highlight of my month thank you thanks counselor 2e_._3694.31 I 'll just talk about a couple of things drought-related last month council approved a an advocacy document looking ahead which the CEO and i presented in conjunction with wellington shire to agricultural Victoria and the Minister for agricultural office and which basically proposes a three-tier approach to further engage with state and federal governments and we will continue having these discussions with the relevant ministers and look forward to you know continuing to support our farmers yesterday we also had the pleasure of having the new federal agricultural Minister Bridget McKenzie and a skip plan and this was her first day of her regional visits in her new role so we were very lucky Lakes Entrance and had a tour of left coal and also Gippsland Jersey and then until that Lightfoot 's winery embalmer farms and then onto sale where the CEO and I along with various other stakeholders had the opportunity to to have a roundtable discussion with all about all things agriculture but really you know I think she was very impressed with the state of our agricultural industry obviously we ruined drought at the moment but there is certainly lots of great businesses and industries within our region and we look forward to continuing to promote that thank you ok on to officer officer reports 5.1.1 planning permit application 59 slash 2019 slash P application for use and development of the land for restricted recreation gymnasium and car parking to the satisfaction of the responsible authority at 70 a straight bends Dale mr. Reynolds good evening madam mayor hello councillors members of the executive team staff and members of the public gallery thank you for the opportunity to present this matter this is a planning permit application 59 slash 2019 it 's seeking the issue of a planning permit for recreation facility gymnasium at 70 Delma High Street Band 's Dale as a result of objections received in relation to the matter a planning consultation meeting was conducted on the 21st of May wherein the applicant and supporters and the objectors were given opportunity to speak to the matter following the planning consultation meeting further meetings were conducted with the applicant which resulted in a amendment to the application just to be cut to be clear the application was amended to include the construction of a mezzanine to include the ceiling of the carer of the carpark access ways and crossovers to make corrections to some anomalies in the plans including door locations title boundaries and the proposed works it also made a reference to specification with maximum number of patrons on-site to 20 at any one time and it gave further details in relation to the car parking spaces and location the land is zoned for industrial one purposes and the use of the land for restricted retail facility is a permissible use in the zone and the recommendation before you tonight councillors is to issue a notice of conditions the merits the planning merits before you is that we believe that the use is able to operate in a manner which mitigates the amenity impacts that have been raised subject to the imposition of the 13 planning permit conditions we also say that there 's a proprietary on site and within the vicinity of the land just to recap the key issues there were four thematic issues relating to noise traffic parking dust and impact to health and well-being I take you to Appendix 1 which proposes 13 conditions more specifically the condition one relates to a series of amended plans these are details that would normally come as part of the planning permit application in in this instance we 're proposing that them a series of amended plans come as part of the approval of the application you will note also the inclusion of condition 3 which requires the provision of an acoustic barrier refers to the closing of the rola door during class times to minimize sound and echo you 'll also notice the imposition of a 20 patron on the anyone time and hours of with the commencement time of 30 a.m. to 30 Monday to Friday not 30 to 00 on a Saturday and 30 to 00 on a Sunday it 's noted that these hours of operation together with the agreement with respect to patron numbers and the amendment plans have been discussed and agreed with the applicant also just draw your attention to condition 9 that talks about some landscaping and some requirements with respect to landscaping on the eastern boundary with respect we request that the recommendation before you is to issue a notice of decision to grant a planning permit thanks miss rennolds questions from the councillors councillor retainer I thank you miss rennolds in in coming with together with the conditions on this planning permit my understanding is both the applicant and the objectives will give an opportunity to feed into that process is that correct Thank You councillor Ritenour for your question subsequent to the planning consultation meeting another meeting that was occurred with managers statutory services and the planning officer project managing this file the next day with the applicant and the applicants advocate wherein the conditions the amended plans the ceiling of the carpark maximum numbers of patrons so those were discussed and agree at this meeting the following day yes in the in the in the balance of the conditions some of them are standard conditions which you would see in this type of development councillor retainer sorry madam I just have a follow-up on to that and so in relation to the OP particularly into the operating hours theoretically if the business establishes and gets going and is there an opportunity for those hours to be modified in the future Thank You councillor ratinho an application is able to be made to amend planning permit conditions as part of any planning permit application yes application can be made into the future to amend planning permit conditions pertaining to the operation of the use on the site counselor hours just to simple question what teams where one is were was the applicant represented by a a planning expert so as to able to interpret the conditions that you outline to the applicant clearly to the applicant Thank You councillor Ellis as I said managers statutory the applicant him himself was a present at that meeting as was the planning advocate and at the meeting to discuss specifically those conditions that followed from the planning consultation meeting so yes the planning advocate was was present mr. hollow just in addition to my colleagues answer there counselor Ellis and thank you for your question the matters that we raised we raised discussed we spoke about relocation of car parking spaces operating chimes patron numbers the acoustic treatments along the eastern boundary and even some drainage matters obviously we weren 't going to give them absolute detail of the conditions because that 's up to my officer to draft up but as a planning consultant this this consultant is well well experienced and would have expected those type of conditions to fall out and explain that to her client when we were in the meeting I just may have just following up on customer Tino 's question and the second question that is on process and what have you if if council is to approve an application this evening and it was found by perhaps the objectors to unbearable do they have a right to appeal against the decision of council Thank You councillor Ellis in the event following a decision tonight appeal rights are open to both parties so there 's appeal rights for the objector against the recommendation of a notice decision to grant a planning permit to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal as is an ability for the applicant to appeal particular conditions both both are to vacate under different sections of the act but they 're the rights under under the legislation councillor pelt thank you given the fact that this property where the activity is going to be occurring is zoned industrial 630 is not an unreasonable time four works all for businesses to start in that area given the fact that it 's industrial so the fact that it 's a house next door is that also zoned industrial or not a domestic dwelling thank you for your question councillor pouts the existing dwelling is also zoned industrial one purposes but has been there for many many years and ASRA as as a result it has an enjoys existing use rights the imposition of a condition to commence at six-thirty is reasonable and having regard for the amenity issues associated with that dwelling I just have a follow-up question if I may what are the businesses along that strip or in the industrial area actually has time frames or startup time obligations against it it 's against its operation times council Apelles I 'm unable to answer the specifics of that question pertaining to the existing uses and whether existing planning permits implement hours of operation it 's just that I 'm curious that you 'd actually put a restriction time upon them on the grounds that you 're actually restricting trade should it want to start half an hour earlier or not so I 'm just curious that 's all this is a decision that we are recommending to you on the basis of the issues raised and the two land uses co-existing together as officers we consider it 's reasonable that the 30 a.m. be imposed as part of the operations giving given the specific details relating to this use councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor this isn 't large number and very detailed conditions that are that are put forward in the recommendation with deadening landscaping and a number of other like regular getting the doors restricting the use of amplified sound systems I I 'm I 'm cautious that a large proportion of the the people that attend this facility in its existing place are for them six thirty years too late the sessions go I think they 're Ofuro go for about 45 minutes so as as the the speakers in support of the the project at the the planning consultation meeting last week stated that many of them would not be able to attend these these sessions and I appreciate that the the applicant could could put in an application to amend the the hours in the future if it was if it was to be appropriate but I 'm cautious that the business may not be able to succeed especially with the out the considerable outline of requirements put forward in the the conditions they definitely don 't sound cheap so coming from my point of view I would like to see I 'm the the start time condition brought back to the original request at five fifty considering the the other conditions that are that are recommended Thank You councillor Roberts the applicant has agreed to the time start of 30 a.m. the applicant has agreed to that condition I believe we received an email from him today yesterday asking that the times be changed is that correct number of other attendees also spoke around that as well Roberts I understand there have been yes there have been further submissions around the commencement time my my understanding of our position is that we believe the imposition of 30 a.m. is reasonable having regard for the amenity issues as raised I do acknowledge there have been further written submissions received in relation to this specific element our Town Planning position to you tonight is that the 30 a.m. is reasonable having regard for the issues counselor Ellis thanks madam mayor miss we 're on I 'm raising this question based on the concerns of councillor Roberts and leading on from the response you go to councillor Tino in end and my earlier question and say to make it amends the the recommendation to allow an earlier start and three months down the track the neighbor finds that the noise coming at 30 a.m. in the morning let 's use that thing I 'm looking at the clock there is a thump-thump-thump and it 's disturbing her amenity her ability to lead a peaceful life does that person have the right to object and an ask for a review of the decision of council thanks counselor Ellis if we made a decision to not to alter the hours of operation and a planning permit was the issue the objector does not have the ability to challenge that those opening hours once a permit is issued so the only time they would get an opportunity to challenge any conditions is during the period of the notice period from the notice of the grant I 've noticed the decision to grant a permit to the permit which is a 28-day period if I may madam there just to conclude this this trainer discussion going through so if we have adopt a recommendation before council this evening at neighbor and the business operator get together and acknowledge or you know agree that there is no negative impact upon her amenity the the business proprietor can then make a further application to amend his trading hours is that how I interpret it that 's correct consular and just as a matter of procedural correctness here and I just want to be clear is I 'm going through some of the paperwork and there was an application to amend the permit on the 10th of May and that application noted because I 'm just trying to scroll through my works here is proposed to it is proposed to reduce the hours of operation with a start time no earlier than 10 power 6 the proposed hours 50 am open for a for a ten past six start of the class so I think that we would end up in a procedural problem if council was to seek to have opening hours any different than ten past six from a procedural process and I think the concern of the applicant in how they 've placed the commentary is that the opening is operating it does not mean that the owner of the property or staff can get they can get there earlier they can set up indeed the end of an evening if they 've got book work to do or anything like that they can stay back and do that it 's only when the use is operating as a gymnasium there has to operate within those hours of operation counselor pouts look I 'm actually on our council website and our own facility the barque actually schedules timetables for exercise classes at 15 a.m. so I 'm sort of questionable as to whether fellow councillors would be up to an amendment for the time to start at 15 instead of 30 given the fact it 's competitive and the fact that we 've received mail saying that they couldn 't these people utilizing this facility would not be able to start at a six thirty it would make them too late for their daily schedules and we are talking daily schedules here about how people can manage themselves and their exercise classes and I think it 's unfair of and having a go in a business to put a restriction of six thirty on when we actually start our own classes at 15 and I would move to make the amendment only the to the recommendation keep the recommendation the same other than just changing the start time to 15 from 30 counselors over to you counselor white had a question before we get into a amendments etc I was wanted to ask officers if if the planning is approved and then later the applicant makes a request for an alteration to some of these conditions does it then be handled by yourself as staff or does it have to go back out to for objections and then will it come back to Council for the decision Thank You councillor white an application to amend the hours in this circumstances we would consult we have to make a judgment about the impact and in this case we are cognizant we know that that has been an issue being raised as part of the primary planning application we would seek notice of the planning permit or to the amend the be a matter mr. Holloman just referred to the delegation the question so councillors as officers pointed out an application to a man planning permit can come forward it would be considered as to whether it needs to be advertised should we feel that there might be some material judgment we would advertise and depending on the level of objections involved and or where the council 's would wish to call the matter into the chamber the medaka need to be dealt with under delegation and all by councils so if there was more than nine objections and or it was called in council would have to make that decision councillor Roberts um thank you madam mayor this is a follow up on what council Apelles just said regarding moving an amendment to change the times to you mr. hallow were you saying that the original application was ten past six so to keep it if if an amendment was to be considered it would probably be preferred from a from a procedural point of view to make it six Town is that correct thanks counselor yeah the application was Council the application reads is proposed to reduce the hours of operation with a start time no earlier than ten past six or six 10 a.m. the proposed hours are 50 a.m. open for a 10 start of class to 30 p.m. Monday to Friday so I think from a procedural basis should you wish to move a motion and that was carried and it was later then if it was 10 power 6 or later than 10 past six I think we wouldn 't have that procedural difficulty question counselor watt Thank You mr. probably my go to miss Bennett I just wondering because procedure wise we 're talking about there 's around the table with the applicant sitting and his adviser sitting in the gallery they allowed to actually speak to what we 're talking about to say yes or no as to what you know what we 're planning counsel would need to suspend standing orders to allow that to occur may I also suggest that isn 't this the role of counsel to make decisions at this point thanks counselor Ellis miss Bennett would you mind circumstances around moving an amendment to a recommendation thank you madam e counselors and and it is a technicality but councils are not actually able to amend an officer recommendation what you can do is move a completely fresh motion that uses exactly the same wording as that of officers but substituting whatever it is you wish to change but yes an officer recommendation cannot be changed thank you catalyst perhaps I might be able to help counsel here I ask madam mere that tell this meeting be adjourned for five minutes to allow counsels counselors to discuss the proposition proposition of moving a unamended a motion based on the advice of Miss Bennett drive a seconder thanks counselor white all those in favor okay meeting is adjourned for five minutes _"

    "text": "thanks counselor retainer do we have a second doc thanks counsel counsel arrays speakers thank you madam me just try and find my notes here madam mayor I just like to just congratulate getting to this point for this project is a significant project for our region it has the capacity to attract an additional 60,000 visitors to the region and I think it 's a great project it suits our council plan as positioning ourselves as an adventure region and I just thank everybody to be involved with this project Thank You councillor Reeves and to continue that especially the steering committee Romeo who whose hard work has contributed to where we are at now this is an important milestone in our economic development for our region in particular homeo we cannot wait to see this to fruition thanks Council raise speakers discussed then in relation to our motion the whole thing is confidential the only way they could find that out is through the Freedom of Information in relation to the four thousand three hundred and whatever it is well can I see that on the screen now further speakers Kassar Ellis thank you madam mayor councils on ploy you to reconsider this particular matter before Council this afternoon it 's requesting the expenditure of for ther four hundred and thirty four thousand and twenty seven dollars fifteen of taxpayers will rate payers money for a plan that has not been tested there is no business plan in place I have again and I referred to the fee was termed the feasibility study I call it a concept plan and I 've reread it and I draw your attention to the word that the company that produced that particular document dirt out refer to it as content concepts at different times throughout the plan they have particular feasibilities which makes it suggests so the document is a suggestion it 's a good idea now on much in favor of improving little by lot of anyone who lives in the Omo region and particularly keen to see the business environment improve but we have to know that we have got something that stands the test this council has previously supported a mountain bike trail that mount now an hour of being used nor of I and I from time to time check to see where it is the mountain bike industry is very very competitive fellow councilors around the state are jumping to it our neighbors at Alpine Shire not 50 kilometers away dinner plane have a 20-plus kilometer track and we 're increasing it by double the size their colleagues at Yarra ranges Council have an eleven million dollar proposal before it based precisely on the same model as we we are being presented with that is the blue blue echo tracking blue Derby sorry tracking Tasmania I can come up with figures to to suggest contrary to their proposals in there but this could be an unworldly burden on the ratepayers of East Gippsland Shire as they are in their feasibility document promoted as being the owners of this particular facility costs show and soda in the feasibility study and further corroborated by our Tasmanian colleagues that it will cost around 1200 per kilometre per annum to maintain these these tracks that in the feasibility study it shows that they need 3 ft positions now that 's I 'm sure they 'll be well-received but that then starts to cut the cost of it being around 200,000 per annum in terms of provision of services to provide the proper employment and tooling for those employees to carry out their responsibilities now my figures could be wrong my sin that my concern could be unjustified but how do we disprove that counselors how do you disprove that by referring to an independent well thought out and produced business plan that provides a strong argument for this track and we have not got that this is committing ourselves to the expenditure of public monies when we have just finished supporting our farming community in terms of the high harshness of lack of money and facilities in this council we have finished just talking about the need to provide proper services and yet here we are prepared to spend just under half a million dollars on what could be a good idea it may not ever be used if a business plans is produced that shows that it 's not a viable proposition now I hope that I 'm wrong would be poor management if you were not to receive a business plan look at it understand that that had prevent provides an independent review that tells us good in from a provides good information so we can make a proper decision no matter what your heart feels in relation to I 'm you know what your heart feels in terms of the idea of by sucking down mountainsides the point is it 's our responsibility to manage public monies efficiently and unguardedly and in this case councillors I suggest that we are putting the cart before horse and I suggest that we wait until we get a business plan and then make the decision to go ahead with a master plan let alone the construction of this bike track councils I urge you to support my position and vote against this not that it 's not a bad idea but it 's not proven cancer pouts thank you madam mayor just don 't need a point of clarification if I may started this council has partly funded the project from counsel budgetary proceeding funds basically 1.5 million then there between state government regional tourism infrastructure of a million dollars have the funds for the federal government 's commitment and the state government 's commitment being received [Music] John mr. Martin thanks again so that 's the the way that the funding works is that we obviously know once the funding has been expended we then provide an acquittal for that funding so to date that I want a very so what 's an equip you you said in acquittal or a whatwhat is that so with all grant funding with state and federal government there 's there 's milestones that you know to me so we 're in an obligation which was signed off when the approved monies when the bbro funding from the federal government was approved and we 're under milestones to achieve those goals that was outlined in our application so once that occurs we then provide an acquittal to the federal government and those findings are reimbursed to Council so from a follow-on can I just ask this 434 thousand is what council is seeking the development of a master plan for is that what get is funding the funding so just to clarify so the funding the funding has been secured and this this portion of the funding so the four hundred and thirty-four thousand two and twenty seven and seven fifteen is for the first part of the tender process there 'll be a number of tenders for this project so this is the first part to establish a master plan for the Armijo mountain bike park once that has been so that it 's actually one of our milestones so once that 's been achieved we will then report that to the government and that 'll be an acquittal process as well for that that milestone can I just ask is there opportunity for the state government to bow out of this project if they do not believe we 've fulfilled the agreement if I may the budget that we 're working with for this project is currently remaining of which 50% is council cash and 50% is the B BRF thing which is federal funding which is under contract and as mr. Morton has explained that will be paid to earth there probably received the first milestone payment when we did this truck that 'll work we 'll get the next payment so it is budgeted and confirmed money and that 's off that 's why we work with a number of our 400 projects that we 're reporting on them and receiving the money as per the contractual arrangements around so the funds within this sound for the master plan and all the approvals so the detailed design and approvals which protects project of this nature are um it 's quite usual that it is up to the so then there is the money that has come from the state which is also under contract so that is confirmed money which comes in which will come in to the project as well so overall there 's a four million dollar budget of which just a 10% if is identified to be four the detailed design and all the approvals it allows you to move to the next set of loved tenders that missus referred to which would be for the construction of the actual trails and all the head infrastructure to play so as part of the state government 's requirements for their funding there was a separate tender process of has been run with regards to going out to getting a business case for the project that is part of the state government 's requirements at a treasurer and Finance level to be able to be awarded the million dollars from them which they 've allocated to us as his waffle indicated well we 've we haven 't_''_750.809 gone out to to tender for that yet but it has been it 's worked through the tender evaluation process and it will be released and that will be done my understanding I think is is by the end of the year that they will be released all finalized to counselor counselor what did you have a point of clarification thank you madam mayor actually it both what counselor Alice has brought forward in discussion and more question would be if someone could answer it you 're actually now saying there will be a business plan and um do you have any idea of what something or that may cost when ballpark figure and certainly the state government have indicated to us that there will be a number of so the state 's indicator bothered the Department of Treasury in finance that it 's up to a figure of a hundred and forty thousand dollars that 's that 's part of the guidelines are there any further speakers point of order we 've already started no more questions I think the point of order is that under our local law once debate starts this no further questions thanks counselor Tina before May and response to that I 'm sorry counselor Ellis counts retainer has raised a product point of order which has well I 'm suggesting it 's not a point of order and questions available under what you 're talking about the point of order that we 're starting discussions well surely questions are part of this question Santa yeah we 're in debate so speak is for or against so I 'm asking for any further speakers it 's really possible why we can review this I think it 's far too much to pay for that okay any old luck to speak to this motion obviously being a member of the primary mountain-bike steering committee and obviously a member of the AMIA community and having followed this project from its inception it 's an incredibly important project this is just but a milestone in the journey that we will see go forward this feasibility study was paid for predominantly by the omiyo BTA in conjunction with the shire so the omiai community has driven this project we thanks to mr. Anthony Nelson who first identified the I suppose the the location of the Omo area in seeing the benefit n shil for such a mountain bike destination I think that 's the key is that this is a destination due to the proximity of the o mio township that 's what sets it apart from now in our mountain bike track Cahoon mountain bike truck in our area and other mountain bike tracks around the state is that that is what cyclists want they want to be able to ride in and out of the town we just add on to dinner plane Brite Falls Creek all of of Melbourne travel interstate travel from internationally and spend a week or two touring around these iconic mountain bike destinations I 'm at a loss to understand why any council would vote against a significant economic stimulator for any town this happens to be in I Mary and and indeed it 'll be an economic stimulator face keeps land so I encourage all councillors to support this milestone in this project to go forward this has been funded already through the building better Regents fund we had a great advocate in our federal member mr. Darren Chester so this is part of the funding agreement so I urge you to support it thank you do we have any other speakers council retainer your right of reply I thank you madam mayor I would just like to clarify a few points and I think councillor I was for his comments however this is this project was funded through a feasibility study that was prepared by experts in this field they had a number of challenges and they challenged the assumptions and some of those assumptions were issues that you 've raised have been challenged about other places and the point of difference with this particular destination was that it 's 1,200 metres above sea level it 600 metres above the township of MU and that 's why people will come and try this this is a different destination mountain bike offering and you know what it 's in our council plan that this is a type of products that we will be chasing and making our region the adventure capital of Australia the feasibility study passed all the milestones or the decision-making matrix is for the building better regions fund you just don 't come up with an idea and the federal government gives you 2 million dollars like this feasibility study has been scrutinized through within an inch of its life it 's past that we 've got that money this is a significant milestone in in that first part of that acquittal I 'm not sure why we 're debating it here this has been a project that 's been approved by council the approval now gives us the opportunity to design and construct the concept trials that were there 's a significant economic flow on benefit there 's community benefits they 're social benefits the flow on benefits that counselor Ellis the next stage business plan will will thrash out has got nothing to do with what we are proving here today it 's completely different that that business plan is about what is the potential of other businesses to service and and support such a development in our region I just like to say this is an important project this facility will attract world-class events not national it enhances our natural adventure assets that make up our region events are a significant contributor to our regional economy just read The Price Waterhouse Coopers jeremy thought paper on this experiential tourism is the growth factor when inflation is growing at two and a half or two percent experiencial tourism is growing at 13 percent that 's not me that 's a economist for PwC and I 'd urge you to read that report counselor Ellis I mentioned earlier on that the National Road champions Championship Road race in Ballarat and that 's just a national event in five I urge all my colleagues to vote for this thank you thanks counselor Tina I 'll put the motion to all those in favor all those against motion carried seeks to only now declare the meeting closed at 47 thank you _"

Roberts do we have thanks counselor pouts put the motion before you all those in favor again its motion carried deferred business business item three new received okay item four counts the reports councillor retainer thanks madam mayor submitted my a monthly report I would like to speak to briefly to a couple of items quickly the first is in relation to the event on the 28th the November the gift saying likes community house walk to change the story this event was also attended by it was councillor pearls white Ellis and yourself excess of a thousand people which when you think about an event around East Gippsland or indeed down the Main Street offense I was right he 's an exceptional sight to see when you see a sea of orange but why was this walk so important on average one woman is murdered by a current or former partner every week in Australia just reflect on that statistic for a minute most recent statistics show that East Gippsland is amongst the highest out of the 79 LJ 's in reportable incidents for family violence family violence contributes to more burden of disease ie the impact the villain disability and premature death than any other risk factor for women age 25 to 44 the focus is on violence against women specifically and deliberately because research shows that it is preventable as a society we can prevent this kind of violence with the following actions challenging and the condoning of violence against women promoting women 's independence and decision making challenge gender stereotypes and roles strengthening positive equal and respectful relationships the walk to change the story was about educating East Gippsland community to the CEO sue medicine Bree Nichols and the Carl Lewis and the team from Gibson Lakes Community Health and I was proud that East Gippsland I was one of the major sponsors say thanks Kate for your team that for their involvement there the second thing that I would like to talk about was on the 7th of December the East Gippsland art gallery wrap 18 exhibition which finished up their exhibitions for this year was Generals generously sponsored by simon ayers and consultants Bansal eager grap entrants were in the running for 1,000 first prize the art was judged by Gibson art gallery curator Aaron Matthews and the two highly commended went to artists Cherie O 'Donnell and Daniel Jenkins but what I 'd really like to just quickly mention was the winning prize which which was by local seventeen year old artist Lauren Hickey for her realistic and delicate pencil drawing waiting for rain was absolutely awesome incredible picture and I 've I won 't do it justice but it 's basically a pencil color and it looked like a photo it was incredible in fact it that 's about all thanks counselor retainer counselor Roberts thanks madam mayor I don 't have anything to report on this month thank you thank you councillor Buckley here we are a pleasant show there were about two hundred plus people there and the rain held off just long enough for the show to be over counselor routine Oh was there and the mayor Councillor O 'Connell did a pleasant introduction thank you Thank You counsel Buckley Casper Ellis well thank you madam mayor to speed things along I like predators I 've stirred cement submitted a report I 'll corroborate the word to councillor Tina on relation to the march against violence that was a terrific event and sent a clear message in relation to our community notice a touch on the fact that we as a group of counselors visited the Western District where we met with counselors and officers from the Southern Grampian Shire had counseled at Hamilton officers from the eluc of mineral sands mine at Douglass and then a few of us went on to meet with local community members near and from the vicinity and the mayor of the city rural City abortion who gave us a wonderful insight into the issues relating to the topic we 've just discussed and I 'd like to you know formally again thank them for the fact that they readily gave of their time knowledge and experience and it was to me it was greatly appreciated and provide us with a great insight into the matters so I 'll leave it at that thank you met me thanks counselor Ellis account for what thank you madam mayor is of course I did go on on that walk 'n thank you very much director kate for finding an orange t-shirt that would actually fit me for the walk but it was very serious and it was great to see you know so many people participating in that in that walk I 've been to many things in this last month so I won 't won 't cover them all but one of me recently yet fisherman 's landing at Lake tires was some something that the Shia sponsored in kind assisted this float they call it which is out on the lake and it 'll be for a lot of the local artists just sit out there and do their work live on board and I believe that the the Aboriginal artists are going to be the first to use it and there 's some worker that 's it 's in an absolutely beautiful setting out there so peaceful and tranquil and and great scenery so which will I come up with great inspiration with that the the other thing I 'd like to just add a little bit more to our our tour that we went on the to the west of districts firstly thank you to Paul for his efforts in arranging I thought it was a great itinerary and and it was a good cross-section of the people that we needed to hear from just to get to fill us in on water but how they had experienced morning same morning but first we went to suppose being in the middle of Melbourne it was probably the headquarters of dilk to be spoken to by fellow in charge Rolf 's and he he indicated to review the reviews from the es as a result of our passing emotion and these were already for key issues in that year so they 're already moving to have a second look at those things was good news we went to once we got to Hamilton their experience was same morning as was actually a good experience they at the time the Aleut were looking for a site to build their their processing plant Hamilton had high unemployment low agricultural commodity prices and the area been not called decimated by um god blue gum plantations which actually took away the families and replaced with trees with very little labor required so they were very in a spot of bother economically and I just happened to have industrial land that suited they had a good water supply they weren 't far from the port to export the product and they had also a very good power source so it was a win-win for them because it created employment for a lot of those people the actual Deluca trained locals who work on at the plant and and after all that benefits and they did not have a mine in the southern grampians Shire so that then took us to to Douglas where we got a a tour from the Aloka staff and it was funny that first person I saw was the same person that was managing me in West Australia rotted been sent over the must have heard that John White was turning up at another mine to us so he came specially to to manage me again but they were very good quite open and frank they showed us through this pit 23 which was looks like it 's just going to remain an open pit for some time because the plant at Hamilton now in recess they 've shut it down because they have no product process there so at the moment the rule Horsham rules he Council have have just this big open it which is still going to probably continue to cause dust hazards for the locals in that area they then showed us a rehab of a farm that had not worked out so they were good enough to actually take us to a lack of proper compaction and the farmer was still I guess he was still being compensated because he could not use his land in the way that he normally would have and then it was very interesting to to go to the can ago all and listen to people who had been directly affected by the mind their their big concerns were that they for some reason many of the locals having an unprecedented increasing cancer cases locally they can 't_''_816.46 be definitive about it but they just saying it 's a little ironic that there 's so many of their their locals are crooked at the moment they also said that the dust could not be controlled on this mine site but continually they would see big clouds of orange dust going across the properties and and then the the other thing was that at that Douglas mine is a big water supply which is to be to remain on site and they 've they 'd been to at least two breaches where that water had escaped into the local creeks and they they also were very critical of in their area so then when we got to Horsham and they gave a great presentation unfortunately because it was so long ago that this mind had begun many of the staff who would have first-hand knowledge of what actually happened at the time were no longer employed they 've moved on retired so I 'm the staff there were good enough to just look through the records and come up with a few answers to our questions and they they had one big criticism and it was to do with the pit and the way the planning system had worked against them because now the mine is closed down it 's not rehabilitation but it 's actually changed its name to a landfill which puts a different perspective on it so it 's just a big open hole in the ground waiting to be filled and they that cost there were a lot of money trying to to have that stopped they and they lost their case that weekend there was lessons to be learned there because the criticism at the moment is that the once mine is operational you know a council or a community you know in a worse position without any consultation so hopefully that 's got a little bit of information out to you about our tour of the western district thank you thanks council work can 't_''_960.7 slip out thank you ma 'am madam mayor I just like to concur with my colleagues and just add a bit more to capsule of whites report on the western district just a couple of nights that he didn 't state that was his oral report he submitted one yet submit one hope it 's longer anyway I just wanted to say with regards to that one of the things that wasn 't mentioned was the fact that the sites that we actually attended were not close to vegetable growing areas while so were actual and all areas there were sheep and cows they weren 't mining vegetables as such as what happens or cropping it overhead they had problems but not vegetable growing such as what we have in the Melinda no Valley and they also didn 't have their main water supply within what do processing either like we actually have so there were two highlights that I wanted to state one of the other concerns was the 23 which was the high mineral uranium level toxic waste dump that they 're actually using they didn 't seem to know where the runoff was going and they said whilst they 're doing soil or water testing downstream from it they 've noticed a lake which is about 15 kilometres away at the head of the lake which would very well be most presumably a downstream feel from the mining section they 're losing fish and they used to have a yeah B or a crayfish or freshwater crayfish of some type which is now becoming extinct down there too so these were sort of some highlights that made our the hairs on the back of our neck stand on end and things that we actually needed to take away with us and take into consideration with regards to our decision this evening I just wanted to highlight I 've sent my report in but I do wanted to say I did want to say I highlights from that was the fact that they 're doing an agricultural white paper and they 'll be addressing better planning in it with regards to agriculture and they also said that they are needing better processing of permits with regards to haulage and that was something that was highlighted in that was also highlighted in the mov transport infrastructure meeting which I attended later that day and they 're also looking at had concepts being worked upon with regards to native forest issues and they 're also looking at super colt civil culture are means something that is crying out for in the native forest area it 's needing to be looked at and addressed as in a farming sector sort of environment the MOV meaning I just briefly go on to that the transport infrastructure meeting there 's a lot of reports and policy getting done at the moment and transport Victoria is just developing its policies there 's roads of strategic importance being done there 's the corridor money 's being divvied out one of the things I found interesting was that the Western colleagues of the getting some leverage on the princess highway damage that 's getting done by all the transport trucks over there and the state government is actually working on a two-for-one option that they 're talking about three lanes being you know expanded to and they 'll be using two lanes at a time and being able to swap the middle lane into either direction so that was a curious one and we were sort of trying to with the seats work that we do I was trying to highlight to them not to settle just for one or three lanes but to settle for four so we have two lanes each way which is something that we 're working upon to be a standard for the princess highway from South from Sydney across to Adelaide and we 're trying to make sure that they stick to that so that it doesn 't get tinkered with at any stage shared transport services for local governments is something that 's being highlighted strategic planning days are coming up for councils inputs early next year briefing early next year yeah thirty-year infrastructure strategy basically to you to be putting into that and and I 'm also considering the future vehicles which are the electric vehicles and I sit around to the counselors the cost analysis of those and counselor to e DD mail back to me about was there any comparison to petrol and diesel I and we verbally spoke around the table and just said that the diesels were still the best cost-effective vehicles for councils to be running but in the Melbourne metropolitan areas they 're looking at reducing the smog emissions and so the electric cars are starting to come on stream down in Melbourne but they probably won 't be required within our region other than electric stations recharging stations for quite some time yet so thank you that 's all Madame mayor thanks councillor pouts my reports been submitted I 'll just talk about one event that I went to on Sunday which was the band 's style toy run which is a fantastic event that helps families in need during this Christmas time aside from the weather there was still a good turnout of around 100 riders and lakes and pick up toys along the way and that 'll go to around 150 families who have registered with the Salvation Army and those toys will be distributed to families all very worthwhile cause and I 'll leave it at that and we can move on to officer reports 5.1.1 new fees and charges mobile staged and outdoor cinema Thank You mr. Richards thank you madam mayor and councillors you would recall this autumn at the council s re at the September council meeting council endorsed the public advertising of proposed fees and charges for the mobile stage and outdoor sooner cinema these fees were advertised for public comment for a period of 28 days with no feedback received and I guess I 'll just reiterate the the principles of setting those fees there 's a community rate which essentially below the cost of providing the service purpose of this is to reduce the finance at the financial barrier for community use of a young of a beneficial service the commercial rate is provided above cost rate and purpose of this is Lucas it it 's not so no that 's also at a level that does not compete with private providers and so given that there was no feedback received these are now presented for endorsement thanks mr. Richards are there any questions from the councilors just one madam Marin that is Richard will there be a reporting phrase directed to Council on the success or otherwise on perhaps an annual basis or quarterly basis on the use of these of these two items yes that is the intent or not I believe it was mentioned at a press briefing that will certainly monitor the use of it and the financial state or the financial situation and report that back to Council I would thinks it would take six months provide a reasonable six months it was cancer Ellis does the recommendation before you do I have a mover please thanks counselor retain a hand a seconder thanks council what are there any speakers or against no okay I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor against motion carried thanks mr. Richards 5.2.1 review of options vegetation management plan for the grey headed flying fox madam mayor this report is presented tonight following counsels request that officers prepare a review of the options that are available to counselors in respect to the very vegetation management program that we 've been attempting to implement on the Mitchell River you 'll see from the report that we 've detailed the background and provided the context of the current situation that we find ourselves in which is quite challenged in terms of being able to realize the original intent of that we actually have for removal and replacement of the vegetation that the colony currently uses officers have undertaken research to look at what the potential options are available to Council the reality is that none of these are particularly attractive in that they all continue to place a significant obligation on council and also to require us to go through modified approvals process many of those as council what we have done though is been able to undertake some conversation or meetings with representatives from the Department of Environment land planning and also Parks Victoria to understand whether there is any appetite to look at an interagency options and land management options the land that the colony occupies as indicated in the report we think this small strategic approach to what is a really complicated manner for council is something worthy worthy of exploring it gives us the option to understand all of the potential options that are and it also enables council then to use that information to decide whether so while it 's not a definitive recommendation tonight in respect to the options and option options that council might actually take it 's a recommendation to investigate further what we think is something that is worthy of further consideration that might result in a more strategic and collaborative approach thanks miss Nelson are there any questions councillors councillor Roberts thanks madam mayor miss Nelson in regards to developing a new strategic management plan and in turn an interagency strategic management plan does that have any effect on the current plan the plan current requirements around stage 1 the requirements in respect to stage 1 and the current approval would remain remain in place so the approval that we have from the Commonwealth Government he 's that council takes a position to circumstances the reality is that it 's it 's not possible for council to do but you will see in the recommendation that I 'm asking Council to reaffirm the commitment to constructing the alternative access and revegetating stage 1 as a recognition that that is an obligation that we have while our ability to do that has been frustrated by the the conditions that are imposed on us thanks miss Nelson counselor tyno did you have a question thanks madam mayor okay what discussions if any have been held with other user groups to this point you mean user groups of the mid-river walking yes stakeholders there have there have been discussions with respect to close the trail and to work with them to understand how we and there have been council has had a discussion with the Friends of bats and habitat huge plans working through these process there haven 't been specific discussions at this point with any other stakeholder groups about this matter that partly why the recommendation is to investigate this strategic approach and provide opportunity thanks Kate I to see a really extensive communications plan to attach this recommendation is that something that you can add to it my the recommendation is to investigate this and I 'm happy the know to take advice from our communications team about how we communicate that reaffirming the fourth dot well the fourth point in the recommendation is to prepare and that that should include you 'll see that I 've recommended a number of things that should be contained in this strategic management plan and that part of that is to make sure that there is a an opportunity it 's premature probably to say exactly whether that will happen and how that will happen so just a little cautious to say more than this is the Avenue that we 're or that I 'm prepared to recommend at this point in time Council pouts yes I was just going to ask I was going to request that we do an amendment and request council Delp and Parks engage with the community of interest groups and bodies to best address the community consume because it 's a really important part by you know not only the runners and the you know the elderly the young mums and there 's a lot of engagement groups so else there 's a lot of people concerned about the Betsy 's people that against the bats you know I think we should be a lobbying body that could actually bring all groups together to have some kind of happy medium and how to work through the group and I think it 's also counsels position to be informing the community on what 's coming filtering in from other bat communities around the nation and how those communities are actually living with bats I 'm whole heartedly around them so am I was wanting to try and up it with putting in a dot point five if we can what do you think counselors you think it 's too mature too premature at least adage or we 'd have to make an amendment after the motions be important so if you wanting to do that I look I think it it 's really important for council to be involved in this process and mostly because of really heavily used recreational infrastructure in band style and so I think you know our obligation is to understand how we do navigate this issue for the community I don 't know whether you 'll ever get and come up with an option that everybody agrees with but if there 's a way to actually navigate it in a more constructive way with both perspectives then I think that 's something worth pursuing and investigating which is what the recommendation is here and after we 've done that then Council can decide you know through that process how it wants to continue to engage the community but the council to do this alone would be a significant undertaking and that 's either have a role or an interest and who may be able to support Council to do this counselor Ellis just taking taking another but to greet further what we have is we have a series of community groups looking for action and and some sort of response from Council in that why not accept what you say about us providing leadership but I think it 's probably of timeframes in terms of reporting back and I think that 's where Jane may have been going was that this this issue has been the management of the the foxes have been going on now for quite a number of years and for a varying reasons but it 's now time for us to pep up the ante and say well we need a report back to Council and then we have to just have a further discussion and then bring this urgency to the attention of our colleagues of Delp and other places to up to speed up the the actions that are being done and I think that might be something that could be considered in relation to your recommendation on that because you know we 've been able to get the attention of both agencies and there 's a lot of goodwill at a Gibson level to work with us to understand how best to go about this process but I don 't want to necessarily ruin that goodwill if you like by putting unrealistic you know it have to be really realistic time frames I going on for quite some time but you know we need to take the time to actually navigate this thing and get it right and try and get these agencies to work with us I 'd just be a little bit hesitant about you know demanding that that happen the reality is and I 've said this in the report the presence of bat colonies whether they 're gray headed flying fox or others in Victoria is a significant emerging issue and so we 're we 're really asking Delp to start to get their head around how are we going to community in Victoria managed the presence of bats so I think we 're we 're we 're going to be testing a little bit exactly how we would go about this kind of exercise but at the moment we do have a lot of goodwill to do that I 'm just come back well I accept that there 's a process of goodwill but there 's also this be a process of action as well and I think that if there 's goodwill and a cooperative behaviors then not gonna say sense of urgency but we do need to up the ante a little bit it 's like passing on their and their advice to them saying look this is becoming another another issue within the community which it is it 's in and it 's becoming it isn 't passionate issue so we kind of need to be able to manage that and so they need to respond to the urgency that we have and I think rather than just going along saying look we 're working with you because you 've got goodwill it 's really nice and they 're nice people up up the top in there in Main Street but the reality is we 've got to address the different issues and I think we just need to bring it to your attention either by advocacy through counsel or through the officer interaction whether we ask for this to come back to Council with some sort of response in and in February or March might be more appropriate to keep the pressure on ourselves to put the pressure on colleagues in top thanks cancer before you is there a mover thanks counselor Ellis do we have a second or thanks counselor Roberts any further speakers simply encourage councillors to support the recommendation before you and to note that there is and I wish to increase the urgency in responding to a successfully outcome management of their bat colony thank you there any further speakers if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor all those against motion carried then a man just um I 'm the request of the gallery I 'd like to bring forward item 5.2 point five it 's a planning application so council parts have you moved it do we have a seconder to bring that forward council Roberts thank you put it to the vote all those in favor its carried thank you okay five point two point five planning permit application 85 2018 T application for two lot subdivision and development of a dwelling at for visual artists Road walk walk and we have two speakers to the agenda so the first one is mrs. Linda Swift thank you for that only this week I live many subdivisions of this property over the years that I 've been there greatly chopping it away but the most another one that you may not be aware of is on my boundary itself there was a subdivision done there during you needed to know what happened there to know how deceitful this man is my neighbor huh he wished to remove protected vegetation under your vegetation removal act your councilmembers told me to stop him I stood in front of the bulldozer to stop him on my land and asked him to leave he knocked my husband down he went to hospital and while I was attending him in hospital unconscious mr. Hutchison sent the bulldozers in and took away a kilometer of trees stumps and all I reported it to council council couldn 't go any further without further proof of this damage and until earlier this year I finally got that proof to give you the proof of how big the trees were because it 's a high impact area of a powerful hour a very shy creature now another subdivision is going through I 'm saying it to sell the land to make money we are in an area of large farms it 's not eastward it 's not Shannan waters but if you allow him others will follow and start chopping up large productive land I have been open and honest with the council in all ways but as the landowner I am responsible for that loss of that land and I am a criminal because of it under your laws you oversee that law I am a criminal now I stand to lose my land over this and I can prove everything I say now if you allow this land to be chopped up there will be another subdivision it will bring in more subdivisions and more subdivisions until it 's chopped up and we are east without there and you don 't have we don 't even have we only two phase electricity out there you can 't support the houses now you may say I 'm agreed even for her tree hugger and all the rest of it but I respect your laws in saying you need a permit to take away far on the criminal I hope I I 'm just astonished that you 're going to allow it all to be chopped up these big properties support people and the rates will go up as all these little properties come in place and the big farms were that are at ran a ninety percent of the area they look at it and say oh well if we want to make a bit of money we 'll just chop off a bit O 'Lantern so think very carefully before you allow somebody who dis is who I approved to Robert Pringle your planning officer he has the information and I have absolutely proved to him and that information has now gone to your legal representatives I understand for prosecution think very carefully before you allow people to have to deceive you thank you thank you miss Swift we have another speaker which is mr. Richard Hoxie from crown Sadler thank you madam mayor appreciate the opportunity to speak to this item this evening with respect to the last submitter I will say I 'm totally unfamiliar with the issues that she 's the first that we 've heard of any issues having arisen [Music] of the nature that she 's mentioned so I don 't wish to comment on those issues or anything else that might um be subject to any further investigation by council I am here to speak against the current recommendation by the officers that 's before you in respect to the application for the subdivision of the land which is to excel as an existing dwelling and to facilitate the construction of the new dwelling on the balanced allotment in and seek the council in fact determined to support the proposal instead of the motion before you to refuse it despite the concerns within the officers report the proposed subdivision is not dissimilar to numerous applications that council have approved since the introduction of the East Gippsland planning scheme in 1999 and with subsequent changes an introduction of the farming zone in 2007 until recently this will say our experience has been that these types of applications genuinely seek to excise our dwelling onto a quite a small lot has not been met with any opposition of advertised and go through the public process received minimal feedback by way of objections nothing has effectively changed in recent times it should give calls counts should give calls to council to change its position on these types of applications it 's a legitimate opportunity that 's afforded within the zone of under the farming zone to excise a dwelling it is a specific and limited opportunity that is afforded it 's not a free-for-all to create any size lot but certainly acknowledges the opportunity to excise or create a small lot containing an existing dwelling the common practice has been albeit not prescribed within the planning scheme in these circumstances that a balance slot be equal to or at least equal to if not greater than the minimum lot size prescribed under the zone and in this instance it 's 40 hectares so starting with less than 40 hectares you 've effectively got it 's not supported and we accept that in our role in dealing with landowners often before any matter is received by counsel or inquiry is received by counsel so there 's a lot that gives would would never see or deal with because we simply say it won 't be supported in this instance however we create the proposal seeks to create or excise an existing going onto a lot of 1.9 hectares or less than 3 acres it 's not a large lot it 's not a large area of land that might be considered lost to agricultural production it will remain there will be a balanced allotment remain of in excess of fifty four hectares more than the minimum lot size otherwise prescribed under design hence I say this under these circumstances in up until now it 's been regularly accepted by Council as a suitable outcome consistent in achieving both state and local planning policy and the provisions of the farming zone there are a couple of V cap decisions that the report refers to that provide will say negative decisions with respect to the subdivision of land contained within the farming zone these decisions date back to 2007 and perhaps somewhat more recent one of 2012 there are some distinct differences in those decisions to this application before you in the of land at the time was limited to only 12 hectares and contained a dwelling the applicant at that time was seeking that to utilize the dwelling excision provisions to create two Lots one was a dwelling and a small and a small lot at 8 hectares as a vacant parcel that is inconsistent with the farming zone and understandably VCAT refused it the latter application in 2012 we will had some dealings with but not for the applicant but in fact for other concerned parties and objectors in that instance the property contained a little over 40 hectares in total but two dwellings the report doesn 't detail the fact that again in that instance the application was refused on the basis that each slot to be created or albeit each containing at one of the two dwellings would be less than 40 hectares filing the basic test if you like that 's generally been well accepted by this council and in other and by others including VCAT is it as a general acceptance of the minimum standard and in that instance of the Lancaster Road matter the tribunal if you like for dwelling excisions to be undertaken in a manner that would retain a large balanced allotment so in that respect this proposal is consistent with the thinking of VK in respect to other decisions also I 'm interested by the fact that there isn 't a more comparable vacate decision within East Gippsland has been presented within the report I therefore suggest on that basis that the proposal has been otherwise consistent with practices now this set the application the meadow also refers to the concerns about a loss of productive agricultural land now from our understanding there have been improvements to this property undertaken by the current owner in our client including pastoral improvement weed eradication and new fencing around the property so they are investing in the land to optimize its production the loss of less than two of land by virtue of the dwelling excision will not in any way was result in a measurable loss of agricultural production that otherwise exists on the land today it 's there for dry land grazing the surrounding properties are effectively used in the same manner the which is currently available today the other aspect of the application the officers report raises concerns within is in respect to bushfire risk surprisingly this was the the first we heard of this concern was in reading the officer 's report after being published in energy within the agenda on Friday we 've dealt with many applications due for both houses and subdivisions in the farming zones by the bush fire management overlay and been successful on numerous occasions as well in obtaining both Council and CFA support for proposals this application has followed the correct process in assessment of the bushfire risk and determined and identified bushfire or mitigation measures that can achieve and satisfy both state policy as well as the provisions of the bushfire Management overlay to minimize the risk to life and property and prioritize the protection of human life a bushfire the assessment of both the wider landscape hazard Closer hazard in terms of the assessment area of 150 metres which is the standard assessment area has all been undertaken as part of the application together with the preparation of a bushfire management plan to application has been referred to the CFA and the CFA has accepted the information that we 've provided and the bushfire management plan has proposed they do not and have not objected to the proposal and they have not raised any concerns otherwise with the proposal or its failure if you wish as concerned by the officers report that and otherwise mate state and local state planning policy with respect to bushfire protection I 'll put it to you that this application is consistent with the relevant all the relevant provisions of those policy and zone and overlays is contained to presently within the planning scheme and call on Council to support the proposal as prepared thank you for your time thanks mr. Hawksley well now hear from the officers mr. Martin island and mr. Aaron Foy and miss Nicole Reynolds thank you madam mayor I 'd like to bring this back just to planning on I want just to planning basics we have before us a planning application that used to be assessed against the planning scheme of today not the planning scheme of five years ago or ten application for two lot subdivision in the farming zone and construction of a new dwelling the new dwelling requires a planning permit by virtue of the bush fire management overlay under the farming zone when you subdivide create a new lot that is larger than 40 hectares the use of land for dwelling on that lot becomes as a as a right the farming zone assumes that by sub being able to subdivide down to 40 hectares per lot that you can that is the you know in what size that 's prescribed that 's the base you can seek in some circumstances and the tribunal has been explicitly clear that it is a provision that is to be used sparingly and not on a come one come all basis now the the bar was largely set in 2007 by that decision on being warden Road it it was one of the first in a skip saying one of the first farming zone decisions that the tribunal dealt with similarly in 2012 that was a subdivision that sought to subdivide two houses on two separate Lots something as what a it was creating a small lot in the farming zone which is an outcome that is not supported under today 's policy it 's not supported under today 's policy because the breaking up of farms or the fragmentation as we call it of of agricultural areas it 's not something that 's sustainable it 's not something that 's supported so namely why is this stuff inconsistent with the planning scheme is that it will lead to the breakup of a of an agricultural holding create the potential for Manatee conflicts in that if you create a small lot which creates a rural living lot or a rural living outcome people move there with an expectation of a nice quiet lifestyle which does bring me to the fact that we we have large amounts of land set aside for rural living and that if this proposal were put forward in the rural living zone we wouldn 't be here discussing a recommendation for refusal we have over and it 's in in one of the maps in the report the the color-coded zone map where there are large amounts land set aside for farming the location that we are talking about is not in a rural living corridor it 's not in a rural living zone it is a farming area and the creation of a small lot again it brings me back to the point about creating a small light and the fragmentation of agricultural land is a negative outcome not only in terms of the planning scheme but in a general agricultural sense further on there is the potential for the increase in the burden on council resources in that when you have more people moving into the landscape there 's the call for two steel roads to collect bins etc and that it actually does permanently remove land from agricultural production now in this application we have proposed line and proposed lot to propose what one will have the house the stockyards to shed most of the farm infrastructure you know it 's a bit of a quirk that we have an application that seeks to have us believe that it 's a good agricultural outcome and that no land will be lost from agriculture yet over to rural living uses and takes the farm infrastructure with it which is a negative agricultural outcome turning to bushfire this is a location of high bushfire risk and whilst the CFA has responded to their referral it was in the context of the the application met the application requirements under the bush fire management overlay namely the new house will be built to a prescribed bushfire tech level and there is the ability for defendable space to protect the house what they say if I don 't do is that they don 't answer the fundamental question of should you be letting someone build there in the first place that is something that rests with Council and from a planners planning policy framework point of view it is it is one of the grounds for refusal that this is a high risk not just any risk high risk location so I think I 've covered the planning scheme side of it there is one objection that 's been received should council vote to issue an approval that approval may be taken to the tribunal and I think I are there any questions councillor pelt 15 meters away from willing in October last year the bushfire management overlay mapping was amended by the state government and the criteria was that any standard vegetation that was larger than four hectares would be included in the overlay as well as a 200 meter buffer around it so it would appear that that is the the catalyst for the extent of the mapping on this property any further questions counselors no there 's a recommendation before you do I have a move on thanks counselor Pelt 's is there a second up thanks counselor Ellis speakers for both sides of the argument keep it I mean the bottom line is you know probably go to bighead either way I would hope that we 're being advised properly by our council staff and the actual application is acceptable to be followed through with so on that ground thank you are there any further speakers just simply say the recommendation is consistent with councils planning policies and and has been so consists so consistent that I can recall many a number of cases similar so I encourage councillors to support the officers recommendation thank you thanks cancer Alice if there are no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor all those against for white against motion carried thank you okay we move back to yet five point two point two capital discretionary fund allocations 2018-19 round two mr. Wayne Richards Thank You Madame a council as the capital discretionary fund provides a small capital budget that allows council to be responsive to community needs and changing conditions you recall in September that eleven eleven projects were approved for a total of one hundred and forty five thousand but through that process we kept some budget for some additional opportunities and I guess an example of this is in in recent times Apex approached us to donate some playground equipment but recorded and some capital budget for for installation so you see that that that is included in one of the recommendations here so through this process of further six projects are recommended for a total of eighty six thousand dollars noting that there were some savings made from from the any questions thanks mr. Richards if there are any questions councillors councillor what you 're just looking at the the costings for that road so on is it a large amount for a salt and it must be a fairly impressive so and they 're thinking of I 'm number one yes we 'll be intent is to it 's because the intent is one of those quite large Saiyans so the cost of construction installation is quite significant any further questions counselor retainer compare we have a mover second counselor pouts if there any further speakers I 'll put the motion to you just just quickly like to thank mr. Richards Eckstein for identifying these worthwhile projects so thank you thanks council retainer any further speakers all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor always against motion carried thanks mr. Richards and five point two point three Swift 's Creek memorial pool subsidy mr. Wayne Richards thank you so councillors the Swift Creek swimming pool I guess is a somewhat unique arrangement and such a swimming pool managed by a committee of management in partnership with Council has provided financial support unite the feasibility study which is provided as an attachment and obviously supports this this model yeah three years ago there was also there 's a three-year Council resolution for financial support but that is now expired and also in recent times the community requested a slight increase in this to make the increasing costs of operations so it 's proposed that this arrangement continue with the proposed increase of two thousand dollars and there 's also an inclusion of a CPR increase annually to the recommendations within the report happy to take any questions question questions yes account slip out smooth council bath we second it [Music] yep are there any speakers community infrastructure such as this is really important to the remote areas and I think I can 't think of anything better than to encourage children to swim and a lot of country children can 't swim and it 's really important to make sure they have access to this facility I 'm happy to be supporting this motion tonight thank you that 's my back way okay then no further speakers against motion carried unanimously Thanks thanks mr. Richards 5.2 point for environmental sustainability strategy annual review 2017-18 mayan Richards thank you so council the purpose of this report is to update the work in this area and particularly the outcomes achieved in the sustainability area there 's obviously a large amount within the report and there 's been an enormous amount of work in this area both from the sustainability team as well as the rest of the organization just to touch on some of the highlights and so council was a state finalist in the integrated stormwater design category at the 2018 stormwater Awards that was for the experience our stormwater enhancement project council energy use reduction of 1063 Giga joules which was 4% there was also a reduction in co2 emissions of 12% part of this was actually that there was a change in the emissions factor but obviously that reduction in in energy use was was important as well that said there was an increase in expenditure or 100,000 based on the increasing costs of power as well as this there was a 60s re there was of solar systems were installed on council facilities Council engaged in the solar Bop bar and there 's currently 266 kilowatts installed across across the Shire and you 'll recall one of the key outcomes of that was that that that money for that power use would remain locally as opposed to going to external power suppliers their support for protection of management of remnant native vegetation and 67 waste education sessions reaching over to two and a half thousand people so the reports provided with four council endorsement but also for a probable to release to the community thanks mr. Richards councillor Roberts question thank you about a man has to take up being on the solar bolt by program has it been successful of a little lot of pickup I guess I would say yes in comparison to other I don 't have the statistics statistics in front of it putting in comparison to other like councils the the tech ups being quite good and I guess I believe in in early stages I recall the figure of 100 kilowatts being a reasonable target so the fact that guess another component of it which we haven 't been able to measure that which we haven 't been able to measure yet but I guess the the appreciation I guess of solar or the increase in understanding of solar from the community may mean that there 's we believe that there 's been an increase in solar installations not necessarily through the solar box boy but through other installations in mostly no sir question counselor Bertino recommendation any me yeah thanks I 'd like to thank Wayne again particularly with the solar stuff it 's more disposable money than staying in our economy and not going to the big energy companies yeah well done good point thanks counselor retainer any further speakers no I 'll put the motion all those in favor most against motion carried thanks mr. Richards okay five point three point one proposal of five be gravely at Avenue meeting miss bennet property was essentially lived landlocked and the solution was found to that through which council could acquire a piece of land subdivided and subsequently sell part of that to provide legal access to this between council officers and the property owners have been ongoing for quite some years and the history is not altogether clear in all aspects however what is clear is that there 's a land holder who is landlocked and there is a responsibility of officers believe for council to attempt to resolve the situation so the suggestion is that we go outside the terms of our current policy for the sale of land which we are entitled to do on resolution of council having regard to circumstances that apply by selling the property at less than market value and in this case Dean price which is something that was we are advised negotiated back in 2015 so I think the circumstances are set out in the report and I 'm very happy to respond to any questions rather than work through it 's miss Bennett counselor what um the the reason for discounting it is there a specific reason yes one was with the best counselor Roberts actually just since I 've asked that quick raise my hand I was gonna question the the section two to three process but questions Casper pelts startle me this is probably the elephant in the room but is there any relationship to the land owner and anyone in Council just for curious and checking I 'm certainly not aware I 'm unaware and you further questions if this none I 'm happy to move the recommendation madam me thanks counselor Ellis do it counsel what Hey there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against cancel pucks motion carried thank you okay item six urgent and other business thank you madam mayor I 'm I 'm just can you just be with me I could bring this made a mirror ask that the following motion be admitted in as a matter of urgent urgent another business and that notion is that council agrees to reimburse council levels for all legal expenses incurred as the result of statements he made during the mayoral election of 30th of October 2018 did okay so do I need to ask for a second alright I 'm sorry so you can 't floor Ellis moves he 's moving that is that help okay [Music] madam a because it directly affects myself I will declare a conflict of interest and have to leave the chamber and I put the motion as it is for consideration or cancel see mr. CEO sorry three meta met before um we appreciate the conflict that 's been declared but it 's actually not on the agenda yet so needs to be voted on to determine whether it will actually be will be accepted and discussed okay sorry that being said I 'll put that motion to the counselors so all those in favor bring it urgent another business so three counselor so no vote so all those against so that 's three three so just mr. C I will three met at me so in this basis thing if it was tied and there was one abstention then the abstaining vote is actually okay council will now close the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 89 madam mayor I 'm happy to move that we now close the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 89 2d of 7.7 as these items related to contractual matters thanks Council retainer do we have a seconder thanks council pouts put the vote all those in favor motion carried _"

    "text": "waiting on average values and rates to charge the commercial industrial rate if there was 5,000 remand homes in the Shire this would net some two and a half million dollars because of their a forty three percent increase in those right in those the rates for those properties and then I 've gone on to say why haven 't we got the differential rate for urban farm land I 'll just quickly read to you and this is valuation of land acts 1916 which is what you buy by reason of its proximity to land which had been or is being developed for residential industrial commercial or other purposes all of the land which has been or is being subdivided into allotments use or intended to be used predominantly for recreational residential purposes so I know that the the act that had to be changed to include urban farmland in the rates categories but there there 's one obvious choice that we 're missing out on when there 's so much development in the area and all that farmland will be rated as family and until it comes online industrial we don 't receive any benefit from so mr. Roth can I just clarify you two questions why isn 't there commercial industrial rate applied to rental properties for residential land and why haven 't we got a differential rate for urban fund as section 2 of the ratings retirement village because the main argument for discounted differential is at retirement villages maintain their own internal infrastructure as enraged street-lighting maintenance of these is the responsibility of the commercial operation a retirement village is run like any other business and the maintenance of any asset the business has would be the responsibility of the business owner now that applies to them but it doesn 't apply to it like me and there 's a lot of others that are now are paying commercial industrial rates when they receive nothing no services for it and just to finish off to apply some ambiguous Chivers for any man is a problem and exercised by this council also been cancelled valuations and the fire service movie classification of the same land do not align because in my case with my rates our there where it doesn 't along and then it 's all state-owned land that we 're talking about that the state technically is the head honcho of their man whether it 's for council or whether it 's for the fire service Libby okay thanks mr. Roth I 'll refer your question to miss Bennett before I answer that I would thank you and and just to rewrite miss manette place I make a submission through to the budget means that would be great thank you next question is from Miss Karina Turner [Music] we 've been reassured by counsel that it 's long as you 've been still further sort of in Melbourne before being exported overseas when the answers are vague and obscure it leaves the green for conjecture in the light of the sixty minutes episode regarding illegal dumping in Malaysia we have the details and be assured exactly where our recycling is six different types of plastic my swag oh thank you um just before I go on to address his question perhaps if I can just shift a lot on that very unfortunate episode of and councils across this photo that there was a lot of factual inaccuracies and our own peak body the Municipal Association of Victoria has made a number of statements refuting that and the very negative impression it gave of what 's happening with recycling it is my understanding that most of our recycling is not exported but given the detailed nature of the question just take them on but that that assurance was actually given to us twice that our recycling was exported by letter and in the council my second question is the city of Casey has a rebate for cloth nappies and reusable sanitary products the city of Port Phillip is supporting their residents with home composting of their food scraps the Hobart City Council has banned single-use plastic the best cash I have implemented the photo system of collecting food waste personally we put our bends at about once a year and we have recently cancelled our business waste collection because we don 't need it when will our Shire have a permanent waste educated to help families and businesses reduce their waste thank you and we around Australia and we look at those who learn from them and have some similar initiatives going on within our council as well we 've been trialing a kitchen to compost our program in mallacoota and are working on a range of other initiatives um council actually does have a waste Education Officer on its structure the position has not been filled for a little while but is our intention to refill that position very shortly in the interim we 've been working with our regional body the Gippsland waste and resource recovery group on a range of education programs they 've rolled out across Gippsland they have mainly been focused on a waste and recyclables for the last little while given the focus on banning a waste from landfill on the 1st of july and given the conjecture on what 's happening in the resource industry generally but we are very much committed to having a position on council to undertake those activities as soon as it goes through our processes it 's in the structure and we 're hoping to get that filled because we can as the educator for quite some time since our last one left we 've got one that works one day a fortnight at the moment and I don 't see a lot happening in this space madam mayor if I if I could just add we 've been going through some organizational changes that position is on the revised structure and we do intend to fill it there are a number of gaps in the waste team as it stands at the moment and that team have been doing everything possible to maintain the services they can and we would hope to have that field even certainly it 's probably my fault of that position hasn 't been filled at this point in time because I put a stop on all recruitment so that we could take stock of what positions we had but certainly as the structures finalized I would expect that that will be a position that is filled in in the very near future thanks mister item 1.8 is the record of Assemblies of councillors March and April 2019 thanks counselor tyno he was councillor to e4 seconding all petitions mr. CEO madam mayor there are no petitions for this meeting thank you two notices a motion or rescission neon received item three deferred business noon received and we 'll move on to item 4 which is councillor reports councillor to Eve thank you mad at me I have lodged my report and I did note that I got a start because I was the first one to lodge my review had a number of different things happen over the over the month but probably the the one thing that really does spring to mind was Anzac Day service that I attended up at Buchan I went to the 00 a.m. service and then went back to the to the 00 a.m. service I went there last year as well and I must say it was it was very enjoyable to see particularly the the kids from the back in primary school who had done a lot of work on the avenue of honor up there at back and south and and the way they march in and the pride that they had in their school and the job avenue of honor it 's it 's very pleasing from my point of view to see these children have the sort of attitude they do towards Anzac Day and it was a very enjoyable day thank you Thank You councillor Chui council the retainer no thanks met him here certainly it was great at the start of the month to get that Easter break in and I think we all had a bit of a rest which was great the Anzac Day services the Naval College one was again a great one to attend nixels who graduated from naval in 2003 gave the keynote speech and it was incredible the story that he shared with us in relation to being in the army for 13 years but the challenges of readjusting back to civilian life so was quite an interesting and quite heartfelt service were well represented across all the Anzac Day services the East Gippsland field days was another event which was well represented by councillors in particular one to make note of the Saturday which was exceptionally better weather than the Friday and the overwhelming feedback from the that we took in conjunction with these Gippsland water southern rural water and East Gippsland catchment Management Authority was well received and that was shown up in the numbers that I think at one point on the Saturday the vehicles were back to the highway trying to get into the event there was another series east gippsland marketing business breakfast series and this time it was held at the federation training new hospitality venue the oak tree restaurant which has been fully renovated on the weekend we had the tour of East Gippsland which was fantastic to have that event back here and just put in context what these types of events can grow in to the five-day national roads race that starts in Ballarat and started a few years ago this year in five days generated eight million dollars of economic activity for Ballarat we also had on the weekend the East Gippsland marketing feral forage and feast festival which was not your traditional paddock plate but more the pest plate and was a great great venue at the back of the breathing in overlooking the brood and river safer morale from Jennifer Gippsland and she mentioned about the Victorian regional community leadership programs I 'm hoping that the newspaper might be able to report on this particular item this Victorian regional leadership alumni now numbers more than 3,700 across regional Victoria and these leaders have become the lifeblood of our regional communities representing small business agribusiness not-for-profit government arts and heritage education health sport and recreation there are ten regions alpine valleys lead laden Gippsland Community Leadership Program which I believe you a recent graduate from madam mayor and currently it 's interesting to note that two of the GLG and mayor 's a former G CLP alumni leadership goulburn-murray leaders for Geelong leadership great South Coast leadership Wimmer North Maui leaders River and Rangers community leadership these programs advance regional and rural communities by developing leadership qualities in our participants and the alumni grow their capabilities foster connections empowering people inspiring confidence and optimism the V our CLP organizations help to coordinate our thousands of alumni and hundreds of important projects and have qts impacting the lives of hundreds and thousands of Australians we need to continue and make a difference across regional Victoria from our local perspective Gippsland Community Leaders program it is the largest running regional leadership program Australia has shown huge commitment from investors and the people who can conduct it and invest their time and people are in Gippsland your wanting to get out and make a difference can become leaders in the future the Gibson Community Leaders program has 576 alumni and include mr. Ken Lay somebody who 's widely respected right across political in Victorian landscape multiple local government council is represented by this alumni and as I mentioned before yourself and another current GLG and Mayor have been previous cohort or alumni this platform helps create diversity within our communities in power and courage and instill and provide a broad range of information to a broad range of experience to further the knowledge around Gippsland but also to empower and create leaders of the future so where I 'm heading with this madam mayor I 'd like to ask if you would write a letter to the Minister for regional development the Honorable Jacqueline Symes and state treasurer the Honorable million dollars over four years for the continuance of these critical regional Victoria leadership programs but also to encourage you madam me to request the chair of GLG n write a similar letter to support the six local government areas in Gippsland thank you ma 'am thanks counselor retainer pencil retainer thanks for that great report especially around the community leadership programs and I certainly support your contention there that we right so it 's a bit of feedback in here at the moment I 'm not sure if I 'm being too enthusiastic with the microphone or not but just to reiterate the support around this table but also the school that I am lucky to be involved in we 've had nine of my staff through community leadership programs in both Gippsland alpine valleys and southwest and absolutely support your words they 're powerful and important and it seemed so important that regional Victorians have an opportunity for community leadership programs that that our metropolitan counterparts through the likes of Wilson have so easily and these are very very important but thank you for that and you absolutely 've been associated with in the last month I just want to draw attention to a couple any particular Anzac Day has been alluded to by our colleagues here and I was lucky enough to be added mallacoota where there were 300 people at the dawn service 300 people at mallacoota was really quite an amazing and atmospheric location and setting and event and I does a call-out to in particular marked Regulus for his work in that very small sub branch out there these small sub branches are held together by one or two people and they do all the work and yet we have so much expectation around those Dorn services and and morning services but they really are held together by a one or two sometimes only people and Wing Commander laroche who joined us from sail and what a dashing young Wing Commander he is both true galas trigger and Wing Commander were both towering nearly two meters tall that I felt very insignificant between those two gentlemen again the field days were fantastic and the last one that I 'm going to draw attention to a lot of things happening around Gibson what a great place to be it was fishing competitions cycling events foraging events food events but I had the pleasure of being at the conclusion of the lakes paddle challenge and those paddlers had the fantastic advantage of a ripping tailwind from Painesville and me tongue so I got down to Lakes Entrance in about an hour and a half quicker than normal counselor Ellis they were down there before they knew it but it was a hunt more than 150 participants which was really fantastic hundred and fifty people took on that challenge paddled across the lakes and the atmosphere at Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club which is normally pretty buoyant was even more so was really bubbling with excitement and expectation they had a great event and it was a real testimony not just to the courage and the challenge that those participants took on but like sanshin Surf Life Saving Club whoo over this course of summer kept that beach safe like all our surf lifesaving clubs do that 's not a great example of the value of and we know how important that is in our region thanks so much Thank You councillor Reeves councillor buck we attended to count a correction and Zack had n say about 50 people there a little down on our last year and it didn 't rain also attended the poet 's walk function at Swift Creek last Thursday 2nd of May it was well attended and it did right and the attendees were very pleased to hear about the council assisting with 4,000 towards this community initiative which started 20 years ago to remember and celebrate local poet John Butler and his poem the river thank you madam me thanks councillor Buckley counselor Ellis thank you madam mayor I 'd like to welcome everyone here today for another afternoon meeting police report having another busy in fact tactic month heaps of meetings both in and out of council a couple of mattes I 'd like to report include being involved in waste management risk management workshop inform and from a community aspect attending the launch of the Tambo bluff Landcare groups 100 steps project in Jones Street Tambo Bluffs this volunteer community project the approach had created a pathway to the beach at the bluff a feat achieved by genuine teamwork in carrying down lots of tools

railroad symposium my further attended the Royal Council Victoria forum in Melbourne this year I had the honour is important on family aspect to be in the company of my son-in-law chief petty officer Scott Smith and my grandson Amy Smith had both the dawn service in the morning service at Lakes Entrance Hamish was able to march in the morning parade alongside his father which was indeed a proud family moment the crowds in attendance of boat service were again larger than the previous years and we 're reflective of the experience councillor Reeves had at mallacoota being in the absolute hundreds the crowd yeah okay I 'd like to acknowledge the work of the executive and of the staff at the like Simpson Cyrus L for Scott and I will made moe welcome and all of this should not overlook the great work at the Lakes Entrance Lions Club and their mobile kitchen which made the morning breakfast tea here with the many hundreds that attended I like other councillors attended to bend style field days on the Saturday of that two-day event a larger than normal crowd was in attendance and with all I spoke to were all pleased with the day particularly noting that the weather was far better on the second than the first of the two days I also attended the Lakes Entrance town-hall meeting how at last Thursday were over 300 people were in attendance the meeting was called by the newly appointed executive of leader who obviously alighted with the size of the community attendance and interest in the development and well-being of likes entrance the new committees to liaise further with its membership in developing a vision for the future of the town and owns to bring that vision and its objectives to the attention of the region 's leaders Council will see further exchange with that group as 'd like to draw council 's attention to an announcement has come out of their current federal election process and that is the announcement by the opposition of the amount of a 62 million dollar beaches and coastlines climate action plan adaption plan this announcement comes as the result of approaches made to both the opposition and just past government by the Australian coastal Council 's Association over the past several years our council has been actively involved in the work of the Association and I currently am honored to represent counts on the executive of that group the announcements like to be seen as a major achievement of the Association as it reaffirms membership and the reason for such local government bodies australia-wide pleasingly this announcement will also reinvigorate the National Climate Change research facility to support the creation and dissemination of research into local climate change impacts through the refunding of the program with three offer of three million dollars per year the current government unfortunately closed that wonderful research facility down let 's hope counselors that that the government will match and perhaps outdo the opposition 's to report the passing of likes entrance identity and Providence citizen mr. Colin Campbell on Friday my sincere condolences go to his wife Margaret and family I shall provide more detail regard to mr. Campbell at a later time thank you thanks counselor Ellis councillor white thank you thank you madam mayor just a couple of an apology for the field days but would like to thank and the the well that brings to the region and also the benefits that they gain from I had the privilege of laying the wreath on behalf of Council which was extremely well attended also run by the Lions Club so they did have a very busy few days of course they cooked the traditional breakfast afterwards and it was a very Solomon somber moment and very well attended and in fact one of the one of the young children that was was sanctioned by the our cell to do this but it was just some of the memorabilia that comes forward and that was of this young child 's grandfather who served in the Second World War and it was a letter and he was doing fine and how are things going on it was just just nice to to actually get back to the realities of what those people injured and what they did for our country and then on the following day the the the been stolen district Arts Society held their annual exhibition in this at Mary 's Hall which was very well attended had the opening and and after after after the opening I I was unfortunately slightly late for that meeting and Darren Chester had introduced me and apparently the crowd acknowledged that but I was not there but I did but I did see her did I did sneak in a few minutes late and had I had a good wander around at the exhibition and it wasn 't from a guilt factor but I did spot a painting that I really really liked so I made a purchase on that night thankful for but in catching up with them afterwards after Easter they said it was the most ever people that have ever been through the exhibition at that time and that they sold a they just canceled I can 't_''_1992.919 slip out thank you madam me just like to say again it 's been another busy month for the counselors and I think probably our highlight is definitely the Anzac Day ceremony which is something we all enjoy doing getting out amongst the the region and chatting with our folks but I have to say this year I had the pleasure of being home you know bossed I did start my morning at the dawn servicing been stolen took my sister who actually was quite blown away with how many people attended it and it was quite an ominous occasion it is really moving I do have to say that the blow-up projection screen probably wasn 't as successful as projecting it onto the BCF building front which i think is probably a more beneficial viewing thing because the blow-up prediction screen kit you know blowing away in the wind falling over and doing odd things but that was just a minor thing um I want to say that being home in all bossed I then drove up there I went to all boss friends and peers on such a day and such a moving occasion and I have to say the all post-secondary school students who spoke with they 're great and did a great job summarizing the theme of the year which was the role which animals had played in combat and for their recognition of their contribution to conflict activities over their generations and I thought it was a really great way to reflect back on you know the donkeys and the birds and the dogs that have all contributed in various and expecting ways to the times that our soldiers have been in more situations they 've played many great roles and I think probably the best story I heard was some of the dogs would go out and sit next to injured and dying soldiers and comfort them in their last moments which I thought was really moving and something that I had not considered before so with that I 'll move on to I had the pleasure of traveling to Melbourne and Prison in Council at the real council summit with our mayor and counselor Ellis and now interesting speakers I guess the take-home from that for us was a fourth was for poor lazy now arm Accounts Department that half of the expected grant relief funding that we actually get each year from the state government will being dropped into our account on June 30 which usually sends us all into a frenzy because it skews our draft budget projections for the start of the financial year so that was probably the take home with regards to us the few days again I 'd like to disrude on that and thank the staff for their contribution because I thought she was an exceptional year in the 11 years that I 've attended that particular field days I went both on the Friday and the Saturday and the Friday there weren 't many people but the 10th the East keeps me shy 10th was abuzz with with people from all over the place but it was great because they 've done aid a joined 10th this year with the health sector and many of the government bodies who are engaged in the draft drought response for the farmers things that are out there for the farming Network for our community and I 'm just holding up a few brochures now just showing some of the support that 's out there for anyone in need in regards to the drought the drought conditions that we are still suffering whilst we have had rain we do appreciate that this has been a really traumatic time in regards to a we 're getting the rain too late the growth in the pastures be the the stock reduction that we 've had the fodder what isn 't there for them to carry over winter and and it 's a snowball effect so there is a lot of support out there and I just wanted to say that our tent was really well set up to address the community particularly topical for what was needed for this year and I thought our staff did a great job in addressing that and to say thank you to the flu vaccination people the nurse in there who administers the vaccination free of charge to the community does a great job and it 's worth getting thanks counselor pouts I sure you have had another busy month and I 'll just speak on a couple of things one one of which councillor Pelt 's has already spoken about which was the rural councils Victoria Forum we heard from a number of speakers that were all very interesting while in Melbourne I took the opportunity to meet with the office of the premier and Minister of Agriculture in relation to correspondents that we have sent in regards to rate relief and again pleaded the case for our farming community and I am continuing my fortnightly comment communication with the Minister for agriculture keeping her updated on the drought in our area and I also met with the Minister of Local Government and extended an invitation of him to visit esketh land to which he accepted and we look forward to hosting him down here in the near future and I 'll just speak about the Anzac Day service that I attended in omiyo which was the dawn and the 11 o 'clock service and both were very well supported numbers were up from last year probably around like councillor to e the premier primary school students spoke and they were fantastic they marched they sang a song and read letters to the audience so and we also heard from Rhonda Bunbury who who was the main guest speaker and spoke of her great and uncle and his course and they both were in the World War one and she was an incredible story teller and so my thanks go to the O 'Meara RSL branch did a tremendous job in organizing both services particularly Suzi Quinta Russell Smith and Tony Q ish and that concludes my robot moving on to officer reports now 5.1.1 Gippsland drought response looking ahead miss Kate Nelson consideration of a proposal that 's been developed to support a planned approach to advocacy efforts to respond to the impacts of action to date has primarily been focused on ensuring that those impacted is supported to managing the current conditions but the reality is that the drought will have longer-term impacts and consequences for our community so the drought response proposal that 's presented today has been developed following discussion with a wide range also developed in partnership with Wellington Shire the proposal focuses on a longer-term approach to the actions that are necessary if we 're going to transition to manage the impact the intention of the of the proposal that 's presented is to make sure that local government and other key stake that we 're working together to advocate for approaches of approaches that are best designed to position our community so the recommendation before you today is to seek your endorsement of the proposal that is attached to the report and to commence a joint advocacy program with Wellington shy and the other agencies that we 've been working with to advocate to both the Victorian and the Australian government and to also acknowledge the work of the reference groups that each organization has thanks miss Nelson are there any questions counselors no thanks counselor ratinho thanks counselor polls speakers for the recommendation I think you mad at me I would just like to thank the the drought committee and Kate miss Nelson for the work that 's gone into this and certainly support this important piece of work Thank like to say I think with regards to the issue in front of us Council has been responsive to the community and I just not to say thank you to the staff who are hearing the words of our community and responding appropriately with good measures and I think it will probably based a guideline into the future in regards to emergency management and thank you thanks counselor pouts councillor II just just more of a comment just in regards to this proposal it really did drive home for me the the issues facing our farmers that I must say I 've not really been aware of but reading through this report and the the timeframes that some farmers are looking at in regards to recovery is just astounding so it 's a report that unfortunately we had to get but very enlightening nonetheless thanks counselor II thought the speaker 's no I just like to reiterate the comments made by my colleagues it is a very important piece of work and I congratulate all the members of the drought reference group from both East Gippsland Shire and Wellington and piece of work and we know that it will be received very well by Victorian and federal yeah so well done and thank you Kate okay with no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor thanks motion carried unanimously item for five point one point two East Gippsland Shire Council Grants Program funding round to 2018 and 2019 mr. Nelson a number of grants programs focused on supporting local community organisations to do this report presents the recommendations from the second round run this year it 's a really proactive approach that we take to supporting community members to accessing grants and developing their understanding and knowledge about making grant applications developing projects staff work very closely that we get as you know we 're always oversubscribed so the process of determining which projects to recommend is it 's a very rigorous process that we go through and today we are recommending 22 applications are awarded funding but I would just like to highlight that where applications have not been able to meet all of the criteria or may be funded through more through alternative sources aware but I 'll do my best to answer any questions thanks miss Dawson questions councillors thanks counselor felts counselor at a nice second sorry I 'll get you next time cancel back away about a weekend speakers for I just like to say you know the grant funding comes around again and it always makes a big difference to our communities when they do receive contribution it 's always this we 've only a small community 46,000 people and we 're very spread out and you know the contribution that our volunteers and our community groups make are actually our community and our backbone to our region so I 'm delighted to be putting to be supporting this we 've been through stringent guidelines and dotted i 's and cross the t 's to this money grant funding out to our communities so we 'll thanks counselor pouts counselor retain oh thanks metameric yes I 'd like to endorse counsels comments but also the significant community benefit that we get out of it but also from an economic perspective it 's something like three to one so for every think I 'd take that any day of the week thank you thanks counselor retain a counselor Buckley thank you I just like to comment it 's much easier to give it away than it is to get it in really with your rights and taxes thank you madam me thanks counsel are there any further speakers all those in favor motion carried 5.2.1 planning permit application three four five slash 2017 p application for a multi lot subdivision roadworks and a removal of vegetation at thirty Clifton and West roadway on and we have a conflict of interest councillor Buckley thank you Thank You mr. hollow thank you madam mayor councillors you 'll recall this application as the subject of a planning consulting of meaning and I believe most councillors had the opportunity to visit the site councillors this is application a 30 Clifton West broke why young from multi wants subdivision for the development of 213 by density residential lots Council Planning Officers have undertaken a rigorous assessment of this application and recommending approval of the proposal in short the basis for the proposal being recommended for approval low density residential growth in Philip achieve the low density residential zone supports the proposed outcome the simple demonstration the area can be developed to a bushfire tech level of 12.5 and does not increase the to human life the suitable response to erosion risk apply to the site the appropriate response and treatment and mapped waterways the logical pattern of subdivision which connects into the existing road network and an adjoining subdivision and the provision of walking and cycling paths councillors as I 've suggested you will be familiar with the 34 objections that came forward with this application it was a subject of planning consolidating on the 29th of January we believe that there many of the grounds projections can be successfully addressed through permit conditions and our book go to those shortly councillors you recall that this this land has some waterways running both through the southern and northern extents of the property the property is 140 hectares councillors you will recall that the land has some topography challenges but basically is zoned and can be and has been demonstrated to be able to be developed for spoken about conditions and there was a number of concerns raised by objectives and I just wish to go to a couple and point out a few of the conditions that part of the recommendation there was some significant concern about the Balmoral Road Clifton West Road intersection council officers provided notice to VicRoads as a big roads Road thick brooch responded requiring an upgrade of that infrastructure and we believe that 's an appropriate outcome there is a walking track proposed to be put through this estate council offices are of the view that although councils adopted infrastructure design manual allows for walking paths and low decile residential zones to be made of gravel it can also be requested that these pathways be made in concrete we believe for reasons of supporting people with limited mobility to allow for different people and different stages of life and also to address erosion that that footpaths should be developed in concrete and that forms part of a condition councils there 's one way management plan that we have called for to address the southern waterway and to make sure that it board away and address drainage appropriately and ensure that there is less of a impact upon our natural environment I 'd like to point out that there is a condition or forming part of recommendation that requires a section 173 agreement it requires a number of matters to be looked at there but I would draw your attention to that it requires that there would be no further subdivision of the Lots created within this estate there would be no direct vehicle or access between Lots 2201 it to 209 onto Clifton West Road so it prohibits those and you must get access from the internal road provided there is as we know some concerns about erosion on this site although it 's been addressed in a comprehensive report the proposal came forward requiring some building envelopes on numerous Lots and we 've included that within the legal agreement so the future development of housing on those particular Lots are placed within the appropriate building envelopes we have also proposed a condition requiring public open space contribution three percent we made we recognized and low density residential zoned land and properties can be enjoyed so that 's why we 're not seeking a 5% of the land value for for our public open space but we do recognize that residents of this estate into the future will enjoy the benefit of utilizing councils active recreational reserves and that 's why we 've requested a 3% return to council so we can maintain our recreation councils I know that you 've had a lot of input and a lot of time to invest in reading this report as it is a comprehensive report and I 'll be happy to take questions thank you thanks mr. hollow are there any questions from the councils counselor Ellis is this development documented or referred to within the bench Dale growth strategy within the band style growth strategy counsel us this land is identified as low-density residential growth infill good thank you madam if there 's no other questions I 'd be happy to move to recommendation but before council are there any other questions okay would you wish to speak to thank you madam me the well-documented application put before council is part of it 's been identified on council before the formation of the East Gippsland Shire Council going back to thee and the days of the char of the install it 's part of the been style growth strategy and leads to proper processing and planning and the balanced growth of the city of bend 's dollars there is a demand for residential allotments as has been made evident to council and particularly by the success of the pre-existing smaller subdivisions in that particular area the conditions put forward to the applicant are reasonable and achievable I believe that the waterways and sewage system sorry septic systems okay for that area based on precedents and other applications that have been approved by this council I believe that it 's to the benefit of the charlize Gippsland and in particularly further growth of the city of men style that this application be approved I recommend it to you council it 's thank you it 's cancer Alice can slip-ups yes I just like to say looking at I 'm the map on page 21 that we 're addressing and curiously looking at the lifestyle blocks appropriately this is a subdivision that will take us into the future I think it 's probably got a 15 year time span about full development fruition the one thing I wasn 't particularly sold on was the fact that ice cubes now what it doesn 't see the need to sewer development like this which in the long run will actually harbor 216 Lots and with adjacent developments both either side and adjoining in the gullies there 's probably 500 Lots out there and I feel it 's something that they should entertain but with that said this application is consistent with our our region 's planning schedules and planning needs and I 'm I see no need to to knock it back on the grounds that he the septic is and isn 't up to scratch but I mean it is sufficient for the blocks and I think there 'll be a lot of everybody happy families out there living in the not-too-distant future I 'm happy to support the recommendation thanks counselor pouts there are any speakers against counsel retainer madam mayor I 'm reluctantly in in sustainable strategic development unfortunately I have some concerns with this particular development my concerns are around the anomaly when the East Gippsland scheisse planning scheme was adopted that this piece of low-density zoned residential land somehow got part of the East Gippsland planning scheme as we know today I don 't believe it was properly researched at the time when when all the playing schemes came together I don 't remember the exact date me Nelson like the other clarify that but I think it is an anomaly it 's a planning anomaly I believe there 's inconsistencies around the Bell rating for this piece of land being a person that has grown up in the area I have seen wildfire come out of that northern part of our band-style here and it 's certainly not a place anybody would want to be when that happens I think there 's probably better fire mapping that should have been used in the application of the PMO 's and the bell ratings for our region being 80% Crown land or or bush or unreadable land and when you have a with the coastal coastal scrub along some of the areas where they 're applying a higher Bell rating in some subdivisions and developments around like tires it just doesn 't make sense I 've believe this could potentially be a wildfire trap for residents and I don 't want my name associated with that I also have lots of traffic concerns in relation to the ability for Clifton West Road I ride my bike along there many times and counselors went and had a site visit out there it 's not a road that can handle that sort of traffic 213 lot subdivision I 'm also really concerned where it intersects on to the bulla Mall Road and it 's extremely busy has lots of trucks on that road particularly when when the school drop-off happens and then that 's going to reverberate down to where Eastwood intersects with Pall Mall Road and we 're just going to be dealing with all those sorts of issues I feel concerned for the local people there that are going to lose their amenity who bought in in what 's grew up predominantly schemes and zones in particular Race Course Road comes to mind and in relation to a rural land strategy which is about to be completed I just see this subdivision conflicts with all that I 'm also concerned about the future services and amenities infrastructure demands the wants and needs from let 's let 's be real here this is a small town 213 Lots is a small town in our region what demands are they going to be placed on and future burden for East Gippsland Shaw ratepayers to fund I 'm really really concerned around the environmental issues of having 213 Lots non Seward relying on septic tanks and as as we all know in this chamber when it comes to septic tanks management that is a easy keep saying show responsibility thank you madam mayor hey miss councillor retainer speakers for councillor Reeves I 'm here to speak against this particular proposal mainly on the basis and I appreciate the words that have been spoken but on the basis that I believe that the fact that this proposal relies on on-site wastewater treatment I think that in outcome now I appreciate the blocks have been assessed as being able have the capacity to cope but as councillor ratinho noted it 's more than 200 blocks they 're up in the hills and they will rely on not just a sewer but an on-site treatment facility for each property it 'll create a legacy for the Shire to have to manage those and assess those and I am of the opinion that in 5 10 15 20 years time as those blocks change ownership and the new owners or subsequent owners or the owners who have lived there for a while and their concern for the pumps the facilities the on-site treatment may become lessened over time and everything seemed have been awry for such a long time why do we have to worry about it now and I think that downstream literal downstream effects of that are a concern for me and I think that this day and age we shouldn 't be supporting a development of this size this scale in this scope that isn 't properly Seward so I 'm going to not support this any other speakers counselor Ellis you should have a right of reply yes very very briefly madam mayor just refer councillors back to the briefing sheet that you will provide for in relation to this particular application and I ask you to note that all of the responsible authorities that are responsible for such things as fire management such as water can control and management series in other words the the authorities support the application and have shown none of the fears that have been voiced here this afternoon internally also the report will show that experienced engineers environmental health officers community planners waste operations and generally the economic development officers all support this particular application this is a genuine growth opportunity for our region and it provides an alternative affordable housing opportunity for people looking to live in a rural residential area counselors I believe that our fears may be not fully founded and I encourage you to support the application that has been lodged with counsel here this afternoon thank you thanks counselor Ellis I 'll put the motion to all those in favor all those against motion projects report 2018-19 for the period ending 31st March 2019 Thank You Madame which will be considering later on in this meeting and really is designed to give you a little bit more detail about the capital program as councillors are aware we have a large capital program the C we adopted a capital budget of a little over 15 million which reflects about a hundred and ninety five individual projects and I 'm happy very happy report at this point in the in the financial year we have actually committed or spent seventy seven percent of the respires budget which is made up of over twenty million dollars of actual expenditure and another twelve million dollars of committed expenditure which compares quite favorably with the position we 're in at this time last year when we had about sixty five percent of the budget in that expended or committed status in the quarter there are a number of changes that were made to the program including the introduction of six new projects and a range of budget move it 's between projects and these are outlined in the body 've also worked very closely with all of our project managers to identify any carry forwards which are required and there are currently 32 projects that have been identified there 's nothing anticipated to be complete by the end of financial year which represents approximately 12 this includes several ways we 'll see from the list within the report several large projects and a number of small projects although it 's a small file package in the report we also identify that we have I made savings of a little over five hundred thousand dollars from ten projects that have our complete they have been put into holding account which allows those funds to be reallocated and the recommendations of before you cancel thanks miss why are all questions councillors thanks counselor tyno councillor Reeves second it dearest to speak to the matter me I 'm just happy to support the work and thank to our manager for the good work that she 's done there thank you thanks councillor Tina any further speakers no okay I 'll put the motion to all those in favor motion carried 7-0 okay adoption for public exhibition miss Liz Collins thank you madam mayor and councillors as councils are aware on the 9th of April council adopted a budget for 2019 20-year for releasing for public comment and submissions and since that time is a result of feedback received by councillors both at the recent field days but also out in the community a revised draft budget 1920 has now been prepared taking into account the concerns that came forward in relation to the distribution of rates and municipal charged charges across the three classes of properties that resulted with the revaluation of the properties what 's before you today is only a change the revised draft budget 1920 is only a change to the rating strategy slash distribution of the rates and charges across the three classes of properties as opposed to what was in the draft budget that was released so no other information or budget details have changed from that draft budget except for the option for distributing the rates and municipal charge the revised budget before you today proposes that the rates of municipal charge be a basically an of the proposed increase for the 1920 year and if council carries the the resolution that 's before you today what that will do will put a revised draft budget out for community comment and submissions a new submission period will commence for 28 days we 'll close on this seventh of June 2019 and it will also change the date for the proposed hearing for the section two to three committee of Council in terms of submissions and that would be Tuesday the 11th of June so I before you is a recommendation councils and happy to take any questions thank you thanks miss Collins questions councillors councillor to e oh sorry councillor what question miss Collins there 's a figure here of 58 million dollars to be expected revenue from rights collection could you if you got it at hand that you could say how much we have seen this this figure increase over the last few years because this would be Thank You counselor why over since rate capping was introduced with their 1519 1516 councils rate base rates and charges have increased by the Victorian Government know 2% to two and a half percent each year over there the last time four years so that has been the increase in total for those years counselor Ellis mr. Collins this is just a just trying to find out I had a query from a member of the public wanting to know whether or not because of these sudden change to the strategy that whether or not the response date could be put out to a further week rather than being of the same closure doubt of the seventh and councilor we have moved the date out to take into account the budget going if it gets released for public submissions the actual closing date has moved and we would advise all that all of the people who have currently lodged submissions that the that the date is closed and the hearing date would be changed as well so we have moved both of those dates or proposed gives this is carried by council today Thanks councillor pelt yes I was just wanting you to clarify the difference between this particular a lot of figures and the previous it actually means to our community how the redistribution of the rape charges have been distributed so that they fully understand what we 're actually trying to achieve here because in the figures the general rate changes is slightly more and that being the biggest group that we get most of our rates income from I feel it 's there position to me knowing what what this actually says to them Thank You cancer pills as council is aware council set the rate increase at the the cap set by the Victorian Government of 2.5% of for our rates and municipal charge in the draft budget that was released in April the total amount of rates and charges to be collected from the residential properties proposed an increase of one point five two percent from the commercial industrial properties two point six percent and from the farming properties nine point eight eight percent so those increases varied and as you said the residential properties that are on the general rate that 's the largest amount of breaks in musical charge we collect what the the change proposed in the revised and a half percent for each of the three classes of properties so the residential increase would move upwards from that one point five to two two point five two so about two and a half percent commercial industrial would move down slightly from from the two point six down to two point three nine and the farming class of properties would move from the nine point eight eight percent proposed increase down to two point four five percent so approximate two and a half percent if you look at them all across each class of property just as a rough figure on the general rates how much more would a housing domestic household be paying on based on these new figures than the previous one on average on average that is the average increase so that would bring their increase down and on their movement in valuations but so the average is the 2.5 to for an average residential but that would vary depending on the change in their valuation can you put that into a monetary value I 'm just trying to get them to realize it in what they think it 's equivalent to you know 5 or 3 for the whole year I just want them to realize that in a value of monetary begun the rates of municipal charge collected on any one residential property would that that amount would vary depending on the under capital improved value of the property so you know I haven 't_''_4586.57 got the information in terms to say what the lower valued 25% middle value and lower value so I can 't give you around about what that is all it is to say that on average no matter what you were paying if it was a you know a thousand dollars it 's just a two and a half or two point five two percent on average increase that you would get thanks counselor poets counselor Ellis and you can blame counselor pelts with his confused sort of question I 'm trying to work out now how and I was trying to pick it up in the briefing shed what we 've discussed in the process previously and that is that we 'd had a complete rating structure and counsel else is confusing a little bit in terms of how did we reach an increase in the farm rate of nine point nine when statutorily were only allowed to increase and the rate due to the rating cap by two point five percent so how do we come to do this because I I didn 't pick that up at any point in terms of breaching a government directive the rate cap is about the quantum the total amount of rates and municipal charge that can be raised the increase how we distribute those is abuse through the three classes of properties and it 's distributed based on property valuations so the total rates and charges to be raised have not changed at all it 's still a 2.5 percent increase in the total rates and charges what this change is is using differential rates to distribute the amount of that total rates and charges across the three classes of properties so on average the amount of rates will increase by about two and a half percent for each of the classes of properties the farming class of the total bucket as well so you is that movement now it doesn 't matter which class it 's still about two and a half percent thank you mad at me this is just to clarify then the nine and a half percent if I put in simplistic two is only because the farm properties have increased in value by nine and a half percent across the board in the East Gippsland region and thus they they are effectively playing simply nine and a half percent more rates than they would have had their properties reminded this at this set set valuation of the previous year in the draft budget what he saw was the biggest class of properties in terms of value of rates and charges residential were only increasing at about one and a half percent not two and a half percent so in terms of the distribution the valuations the greater increase in valuations what I 'm occurring properties as a percentage increase and when we applied the differential rates of 90% of the general rate to farm properties and 145 to commercial industrial we had the this proposal has really looked at the differential rates and is proposing an eighty two point five percent differential rate for the farm properties and a hundred and forty three percent differential for the commercial industrials so both of those differentials have then been seeing the distribution changed by the application of differential rating so the valuation increases and changes have all remained the same but the differential rates have been amended to more evenly distribute the rates across the three classes of properties so that effectively gives the the farmer against who which is a business a 5% discount over in over say a retailer or someone like that so that they 're paying perhaps what we were saying as a hundred and fifty percent less in natural rates they 've been given in general commercial properties a two percent discount and the farmers have been given a seven and a half percent discount he said how we 're reading it the what the revised draft budget does is that we look at the increase from the amount of rates and charges that were raised each part of property rates and charges that would be raised in 1920 so what it says that on average the farm properties would incur a two and a half percent increase commercial so all of them would would approximately incur a two and a half percent increase you know that 's if their valuation movements obviously we 're all the same but valuation movements do go up and down so some will be slightly more within the class and slightly less but on average about two and a half percent so that 's what the differential movement in the differential has done has more evenly distributed the change in the rates from one year to the next this this matter before council is to be taken out for public discussion and adoption so it 's no use me getting too bogged down but I understand that but that that 's an adjustment of the capital improve value that we 're playing with because we 're compliant with the state rating cap of two and a half percent just to respond to that valuations have not changed the same valuations are in here but it 's it 's the change in the use of differential rates yes yep I 'll just as the the valuations are still used to distribute the rates bucket but the rating the dollar that 's used and applied to each of the classes of properties has changed so that the the spread of the rates into the three classes of properties changes because of the differentials but that the values remain the same yes I 've just got councillor white then in councillor Buckley thank you thank you madam mayor I would just like to bring the attention to the chamber that yesterday evening I was actually presented or asked to submitted a petition signed by about 400 people over the space of only a few days I did I did explain to the gentleman that I didn 't feel it could be at this stage it was too close to the is my meeting so that it would be in the June meeting that it be submitted but it was is a petition basically objecting to this larger rate increase I 'm tried to get the message out of rural Victoria and this is if I 'm wrong where this is the first year of an annual revaluation since last year when that was all introduced and and I feel that even though we can play around with all the figures that the real the real price will only be shown when the rate notices have been sent out to landowners property owners so it won 't be until then that they really see exactly what their own individual rate we 'll be and I think across the state particularly as we see that I think the area of shepherding had something like a 30 that there will be unfortunately and this will reflect on our bottom line as a budget I 'm pretty sure whether there will be a lot of objections to the valuations considering for us and for Wellington that we are in a drought a general opinion that they couldn 't believe their property those would have gone up so I think even though it certainly would would I 've counseled two in our time move these figures around to relieve that the real course it will fall back on council if the decisions go in favor of the people who are objecting and then you actually see that fortunately without being out to change the figures you actually probably receive a lesser rate revenue if if these objections are up to but this particular petition as we 've said couldn 't be tabled today but I will bring it forward for the June and one one little aside to that to give the public a bit of a look into how things are affecting the flowers from from the drought one business one rule supply apologized for for only having three signatures on the petition and the reason he was apologizing was that everybody who came into his shop in those few days actually signed the petition but unfortunately he only has customers gives you general feeling that yes councillor Buckley percent increase in the valuation if a farmer was buying say ten thousand dollars a year in rates which we know they can well I won 't go into that but would with this nine percent increase in the valuation mean that or would he pay was a two point five percent increase would he pay ten thousand two hundred and fifty or would he pay less if I can get an answer to that um councillor Buckley so what 's proposed with the revised drug budget is that on average the farming class of properties would have an increase in total rates and charges of only under two and a half percent just under two and a half percent so regardless of the evaluation movement on average the rates and charges municipal charge would be just under two and a half percent depending on the change in the evaluation some may be slightly greater some may be slightly less also noting with the farm properties the impact of the reduction in the municipal charge as well impacts through to that group but their total revenue of REITs and municipal charge just under two and a half percent regardless of on average regardless evaluation changes the revaluation counselor Buckley is for every ratable property in municipality whether it be residential commercial industrial and farms all have been revalued and as noted before all approximately on average will incur a two and a half percent increase from there 19 rates so what what this proposal does is even out that proposed increase which is the rate cap of two and a half percent even that out across the three classes of properties on average I 'm spent Thank You D this unspent left over thirteen million dollars or something we couldn 't grab some of that and say give him a 5% discount overall would that be a wise move or something no yes or no I could ask counselor counselor Buckley there is a further discussion if you 're if you 're looking at in terms of taking into account all with the financial information within the revised draft budget which hasn 't changed from the draft budget that the operating surplus is one component of many financial components that make up how council operates right through to our capital works program of over thirty million dollars through to the operating projects and process and process in the I think that 's included in the surplus so to be able to discuss picture of all of the things that council must do and pay for in terms of our cash so what an operating surplus is versus what our balance sheet and our cash flow tells us is a further discussion so but there 's proposed to be no change from that operating surplus that was included in the draft budget do we have any other well it 's on average counsel Buckley so some farmers may see a reduction in their rates it just it will depend are there any other questions can I get a mover for the recommendation okay thanks counselor parts counselor raves second would you like to speak to the motion thank you and thank you officers for your unduly thought in this process because after the field days councilors had such a response from the community in regards to the budget proposal that we the valuations that we actually putting out a proactive response and this is our proactive response to revised figures for this year 's rating strategy and lizoni and her team they 've worked tirelessly to try and find a compromise and this general rates will will be slightly higher and they never have been than the hundred percent before I think they 'll be paying on an average I think when it was equated to us and I was trying to get it out of Belize earlier but she wasn 't committing it will be the price of a coffee with regards to the commercial Industrial they will be getting a reduction and with regards to the farm rate they will be getting a further reduction than their normal ten percent that they actually have had in many previous years with that said I would like to make it very state stated that this is a one-off year that this is going to be offered the bottom line is we can 't sustain and in years to come and I think the community should be should be happy with the response that council is acting within the words of the community and listening to them and acting proactively in regards to their quest you know we understand some years are better than others but I have to say overall you know this to commend it to the rest of our council group thank you thanks councillor parts councillor Reeves first of all thanks councillor pelts for those comments they were very important and to Lee 's on your team and the CEO thank you for being responsive very quickly to to be able to bring this to us it 's very important that we can show our community that we are responsive we have heard what they 've said and by using the levers available to us around differential rates were able to flatten those variations that have been caused by in particular valuations and we were caught on the hop a bit by the the increase in farm valuations there 's no doubt about that and and this is the way that we can actually respond to that by using this differential rate strategy now having said all of that we want this region to be not just a great place to farm and to live and to grow but a great place to grow old great retire to recreate in and sometimes to be sick in so we need to it 's the remit of council to provide those services so we need good airports we like to have boat ramps we need to have that first and last mile road into our farm accessible so they can do business throughout the whole year and we want to have as level crop the crossing supervisors we want to have our swimming pools available all of those services libraries and so on that the show.i provides hundred services in a hundred days and that 's what we provide through collecting rates and the challenge for us is to how to evenly distribute the collection socialize the collection and socialize the benefit of that now rates are a fixed business cost and we know that and we know that farms have a much higher obviously capital investment to their capital return than other businesses so we recognize that as well and we understand the challenges that farmers have and as councillor Pelt 's alluded to council will review its rating strategy year by year and be responsive to the needs of our community but this is I think are really a good we can equate the increase for a general rate to maybe a cappuccino a week that 's the sort of the price difference maybe on average the middle 50% of valuations and that 's what we 're asking our community to recognize that to support our businesses and our farmers at the moment that if you can forego that cappuccino a week then that would go a long way to alleviating the rate burden on some of those farmers so thanks councillors please support this thanks councillor raves speakers against speakers for counselor Ellis thank you madam me and Thank You councillor reef for carrying a good argument across for this matter on a humorous note this has been a flexing matter for me in terms of this because we we find ourselves as a council subjected to the actions of another level of government and one only has to refer to the front page of the local paper yesterday to see where the responsibility for that lies when our local member was referring to the right situation the setting of rates and the value which was introduced introduced by have increased to a stage where we at local government level have to act upon the actions of a higher level humorously and going through and trying to research the arguments to or for is farming a business or is it not why should one sector of the business community be given an advantage over the other who should you know who feels in Thailand I stumbled across the old argument of the in the doctrine of entitlement and for those counselors that suffer from insomnia I recommend you reading the arguments between the two principle philosophers Rawls and Nozick in relation to this particular matter this is an argument that 's come as I say from a state government level and it impacts upon us and the management and we do the common decent thing to do with what we 're offering here today of course and that says what counts the reason third and that is to show empathy for one particular section it 's like my argument that I put to your counselors in relation to considering those on a disability or age pension well I asked move no room to move but a farmer will he will trade out of this situation so that 's not to say that one should not back any care any reasonable argument for assistance and in this case in this one one year of situation is cancelled palces alluded to I support that empathy to assist our farmers and getting through I recommend the motion before council thanks counselor Ellis counselor Tina thanks madam me I would just like to reiterate all the comments that have made today this is a responsive and responsible budget and I know each of us is had to think about this and you know field sentiment from our communities and we all go through a lot of angst to try and come up with the right formula I believe this is the right formula I really do think and endorse council Reid 's comments for Liz and the finance team is sorry it 's being able to get that good information responsive information that helps us make good decisions so I 'll certainly be supporting this motion and and encourage all my colleagues which thanks counselor Tina any further speakers councillor Buckley what I 'm saying here there 's absolutely no reflection on the integrity and the ability of the team that works on this you know I realize it 's a very very difficult situation where you 've got a trying police the last it seems to be a vast amount of the community and and the us that have got to try and get the money in and provide all the services but unless we can bring this down some how so that there 's an overall reduction in the rates which certainly Bo what I 've been listening to there 's not going to be I 'm afraid I can 't_''_6067.309 supported thank you man and me counselor 2e_._6072.469 thank you madam mayor I am of the same opinion as councilor ratinho all of us all of us have to run a balanced budget we cannot spend more than what we earn now this relates to myself personally at home and it 's also a decision that I have to make here in Council in conjunction with my colleagues and the balance of ensuring that we get to move forward in in a fiscally responsible manner so I would like to thank you miss Collins for giving us the information that that we were after thank you thanks counselor Tori any further speakers counselor Pelt with that all stated I also would like to state that the underlying bonuses also here that are going by the wayside is the medicinal municipal charge has been dropped down from 18% to 14% and we 're endeavoring to get that down to 10% within the next two years and that 's a bonus from these rates that actually hasn 't been highlighted we 're striving to get them down and hopefully get rid of them completely come into the future so that 's the area that I 'd like the community know that we 're trying to proceed in and I invite you all to be active and read and and respond to our draft budget and and to please appreciate with them working on this budget I think it first came to us December last year so it 's not as if we 've been discussing this for a very long time now and this change in our draft budget has come as a response directly from for our community and I think it 's really responsible and I think I 'm delighted to be saying we were able to hear our community and listen to their brief and put something forward that we believe is a responsible you know draft budget within the timelines and the time frames that were restricted to working so with that said that Amir I 'm pass it back to you thanks counselor Pelt 's i put the motion to all those in favor all those against motion carried six to thank you Miss Kahn 's five point three point two draft revised council plan 2017 to 2021 mr. David Radford thanks madam mayor and good afternoon counselors counselors as you will be acutely aware the the council plan and budget go hand in glove so the purpose of this report is simply to seek your endorsement to amend the closing dates for submissions and the section two to three hearing date of the draft revised council important to note that the council plan and strategic resource plan the documents that have been provided to you today they haven 't been altered since they were adopted by council at the April meeting the recommendations before you today are simply to align the submission dates and the hearing date with the revised draft budget which councillors have just discussed so councillors if approved the amended closing date for written submissions will be noon on Friday the 7th of June and the date for the community to hear the section two to three hearings submissions would be one o 'clock on Tuesday the 11th of June councillors there 's some recommendations before you thanks counselor Ellis counselor Tori second speakers we 've already moved it so this is speaking for the emotion counselor Buckley well you never gave me a chance to do it easy to say anything against the ocean you just went way back are you gonna speak against it are you speaking against the motion well can I speak now well I 've got a question really as if we say yes to was here proposed hand-in-hand with the council flame how can I then clearly vote for the council plan went on the post part of it counselor to answer that question the documents that have been provided to today haven 't been altered since they were formally endorsed by counsel at the April meeting the recommendations before council here to decide a purely around the dates for the submission period and the section 2 to 3 hearing submissions thank you well it 's not to do with the content of the budget the council plan is the overarching guiding document that the council is legislated to to form as when councillors elected council was also required to to go back and review the council plan for currency on an annual basis that process was discussed at the April council meeting and the council plan drives the the budget and the strategic resource plan is a document in the middle that that describes how we 're going to achieve the objectives out of that out of those documents respectfully I don 't think you 've answered my question you see why we paid for the the budget it 's certainly nobody else matter than Kensing client I suppose we go back to the original council plan document which hasn 't been halted since it was adopted by council at the April meeting the recommendations are purely around the submission period and the section two to three hearings yeah just let me get try and get this straight in my mind mr. Emery can you tell us is the council budget a creature of the plan and therefore R aligned on the plan being adopted I think that 's where councillor Buckley 's going or is it are they two standalone items documents there are definitely some synergies but for the point of the exercise the documents do to stand apart one one is purely a plan and the other is the is outlining the financial resources that articulate how those actions or objectives from the council plan are going to be met thanks counselor Ellis did you wish to speak to the motion just simply to say that we are all familiar with this particular plan and we encourage members of the public to review constructive or not constructive to assist us in planning even better thank you any further speakers counselor Tina yes I certainly made me I 'm speaking in supportive of the recommendation motion this is our council our council plan you know we worked workshopped it we put it out to our community we 've since checked it and this is another step of sense checking it and I 'm certainly looking forward to putting some more rubber on the road with her you see o next 17 months thank you thanks counselor retain a if there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion carried unanimously thanks mr. Radford five point three point three finance report period ending 31st of March 2019 miss Liz Collins thank you madam mayor this report is for the nine-month period ending 31st of March 2019 in terms of council 's financial performance both here today and in terms of the forecast for the full year the operating forecast for the 1819 year is now forecast at nine hundred and twenty four thousand compared to the adopted reported the most significant item that has changed there is relates to operating projects that were carried forward from the previous year where there was funding attached to them and they now convene completed in the 1920 year so the income was included the year before and their expenditure in the current year this year apart from that you 'll see there 's a variance in the expected via cash position of counsel and as Miss wigglers previously reported there are a number of capital projects that for various reasons will carry over for completion in 1920 in terms of council cash that 's just over eleven million dollars of that forty million dollar variants the the other component of that variance in the forecast cash relates to the final end of year position cash position last year compared to what was forecast at the time of adopting the budget so as mr. Eagle has already reported on the capital program so I don 't propose to go through that but in terms of at the nine-month period there is nothing there that needs to be flagged further from anything recommendation there for councils and happy to take questions thank you thanks miss coins question cut slip-ups curiously I see that these carryovers from 1718 financial 1819 are there many projects that are still being carried over from like 3 from memory so there 's two or three landfill project another one who gives the Harry Quinn 's the upgrade but there 's very few that in multiple yeah carry on process and certainly they 're ones that we 're focusing on very strong today it makes you to make sure if I may have a follow-up question there reason being with the Lakes Entrance landfill is it because API is changing their regulations and we still need to keep complying because it will be a legacy for council on all our landfills because of these stringent guidelines that they keep changing but certainly the EPA does have very stringent it is a legacy landfill which it comes with its challenges because we 're there popping fun along the design of the company we engage and then the design does need to be APA approved and accredited before we can questions councillors council pulps moved council retain no second it do you wish to speak counterparts no I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thanks mr. Collins item five point three point four motions for Municipal Association of Victoria State Council meeting may 2019 miss Carr Cashman thank you madam mayor their report before you today these councils retrospective endorsement for two motions titled reducing repetitive and return motions to the Municipal Association of Victoria and funding the protection of Victorian and coastal assets which is there two motions that have been listed for discussion at the ma V 's upcoming State Council meeting which is on Friday 17th of May the endorsement of these motions prepared by council officers on behalf of council has unfortunately been retrospective due to the deadline for submitting motions for listing which was in fact the 23rd of April so the report itself covers the context of both the motions that are looking to be put forward so if there are no other queries on those particular motions I ask that council consider the recommendation before do you wish to speak to the motion Council Ellis just very quickly where 's well Nations to be debated and I hopefully will be supported by the majority of counsels particular the issues on coastal matters as I referred to in my council report it was pleasing to hear the opposition coming out supporting local government in the maintenance of the coastal assets and let 's hope that mr. Chester is sitting there watching this live streaming and decides to pick it up and comes on board so that I can walk in with great confidence on Friday week and get this motion put across so councils I 'll recommend the two motions to be adult if there 's no further no further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you Mr Cashman five point three point five electoral representation review approval of submission in response to the preliminary report prepared by the Victorian Electoral Commission miss Cashman thank you madam mayor the Victorian Electoral Commission began a representation review in early February this year which it does periodically to fair and equitable representation for all voters this is also a man that mandated requirement under the Local Government Act so what it does in in its review is it considers whether a local council has the appropriate number of councillors whether the local council should be unsub divided with councillors elected from the whole local council or subdivided in towards or if it is subdivided the number of wards Ward boundaries and the number of councillors per ward the review process includes a public submission process for 28 days with the VEC then presenting representation offers off sorry options in a preliminary report and following the publication of that report submissions can be offered up to the VEC which then goes through another public hearing and consequently ending in a final report being presented to the Minister for local government so today the report in front of you is in response to the preliminary report prepared by the VEC this comprehensive submission prepared by officers speaks to the three alternative offers the options that were posed in the preliminary report with council supporting the option to maintain the number electoral structure just for noting that the submission period for this for the submissions is tomorrow the 8th of May 2019 so once this submission has been endorsed we will be forwarding it to them in due course if there aren 't any other questions I 'll leave the recommendation as he is thank you Thanks so there any questions counselors Thanks can 't slip back way yeah the counselors what can we put in individual if we if I haven 't got time to do it now but can an individual counselor do this or is it just for the public the general public thank you and that 'll do for now personally let 's let me scare Anantha thank you basic cancellous and that one that took evening province and thank you that 's mine sign up but biting against this wouldn 't mean anything anyone would it councillor Buckley if if you wish if you can convince the majority of your colleagues and here 's in answer to the questions very clear and they were open to thank you for that response well through you madam me on those lines of what I suggested option B well we 've only got four sorry well couldn 't can we get around it this way can I move a motion in in and you know other business urgent another business miss Bennett the idea is really we 've already lodged a preliminary so just to remind mind us councillors what our submission was please it wasn 't about cancelling II had a question thank you madam mayor I did have a question and it was in regards to an email that we 've seen today questioning the the I think two items in our in our submission and whether they were valid or not so there our submission will let me checked against that information just to ensure that that what we 're putting forward is correct Thank You councillor yes since that email has been presented to Council the governance compliance coordinator has actually checked the validity of those comments and has confirmed that in regards to what 's actually being submitted to you today in terms of the report that their facts are actually drawn correct in changes being made councillor ease thanks man miss Cashman or miss Bennett I do recall reading the local council representation review that was provided us after submissions and that was published in April and I think it dealt quite comprehensively with the options that councillor Buckley has mentioned and the basis of our recommendation is on that review and I did read read that thoroughly and thought that that your proposals have been submitted they 've been considered and and we have taken into account here is that correct yes IDs councillor Reeves thank you thank you well mayor I move the motion be put Thank You councillor we 've got a mover and a seconder councillor Pelt to remove the motion do you wish to speak to it councillor Reeves thinks that I think this matter has been dealt with quite comprehensively already I would like to bring up a point of order here but I don 't think it has been dealt with because I 've heard people say since all that that they 're not happy with this and so how could it be have been dealt we did fairly obvious to me now that you 're going to pass this recommendation and that means it 's done and dusted doesn 't it mayor point of order can I just clarify what 's your point of order counsel Buckley what sorry I 'm just wanting to clarify what your point of order is that council Reeve is saying the matters done and dusted and then be thoroughly dealt with and I 'm just saying it hasn 't because it 's a bit like an appeal you know when extra evidence becomes forward the appeal must be dealt with let me spin it what causes well common sense rule well where does it common sense is not allowable is that what you 're trying to tell me counselor mere once again point of order sorry sorry counselor Buckley that point of water is not accepted sorry the motion has been put and moved so counselor pouts would you like to speak to it yes I would and I 'm hoping that with saying this it might help counselor Buckley to understand that in our notes he submitted who as an individual all your friends and your representatives there will be they will have the opportunity to do so at a public hearing convent but convened by the VEC to be held here in the council chambers on Wednesday the 15th at 00 p.m. so if you and you know whoever else you 've fancy you can come in here on the 15th next Wednesday not tomorrow but the following week and it 's in your notes here in front of you on page 59 Wednesday the 15th of May 7 p.m. to talk exactly about this point that you 're trying to make but at this stage I think in our proceedings it 's right the right thing for us to do is to go through the process of what the majority of counselors have convened to the officers which is in the recommendation here in front of us thank you thank you for your observations councilor pelts [Music] but I 'm fairly short just to avoid that there 's an opportunity to speak to a solution so unless counsel has are there any further speakers for Knights all those in favor against motion carried 71 thanks miss Cashman five point three point six report on audit and Risk Committee meeting held on 30th of April 2019 miss Cullen thank you madam mayor so the report before you today is a snapshot of the audit and Risk Committee meeting that was held on Tuesday the 30th of April 2019 the full complement of the committee was there say for one but in terms of the content and the agenda that was discussed the issues of notes that were considered by the committee at that meeting were mr. Andrews a bizarreness of Crowe who through his counselors internal auditors presented a report on the internal audit of campus landfill rehabilitation management of former landfill sites which was a key audit as part of our internal audit program for the 2018 2019 year the audit actions update report on the Raymond island ferry outage of 2017 and which is quickly coming to an end and that was that of those actions that were incorporated within that report being 16 items for consideration that 13 of those have been completed with of June deadline there was the notification provided to the committee on regarding the timeline for its annual performance evaluation which is a standard process that the committee undertakes each and every year and that is set to begin in July and for further that after consideration of the draft work program that was presented to the committee and recognizing that much of that annual work is mandated by the audit and risk committee 's charter that the committee has asked that the issues with the work program the Charter the timing of the meetings and agenda distribution require a comprehensive analysis to ensure that we can streamline a lot of the timing of lovekins reports making sure that the reports that are presented are those of importance and so that we can make that a really comprehensive and robust forum for the governance Oversight Council so those were the four main items listed as key notes for discussion if there any queries on the report or the committee meeting itself from hoping to feel those thank you thanks Kent sir Ellis I 'm still carry a fair bit of with that appreciating the nature of the report you 've just table would counsel can you tell me whether or not we will be receiving a more in-depth report to Council in regard to the auditor 's inquiry and compliant and the responses in regard to he 's in Cori at council level I appreciate it could be in camera but who is that coming to Council Thank You councillor Ellis yes as part of the process when the initial request was made for a an audit report to be generated and for council officers to report against that there was a closeout report that was to be brought toward to council certainly that well depending on whether that 'll be in camera or not that will be remain and I 'll talk to learn to miss Bennett on that but yes there will be a closeout of that so that all the recommendations made within that report truly identified and noted by counsel that they 've been completed thank you Miss Cashman is important the Audit Committee reports to Council on all these sorts of matters of concern Thank the first one on page 65 of our notes there 's a thing he 's saying council officers propose changes changing the policy review period from one year to three years for the following reasons and this is on the risk management reports policies and they 're saying it 's inconsistent the consistency of the council 's position on risk management and legislation means that the content of the policy really requires change administrative efficiencies and no anticipated loss of efficiency so is there room in there to have whilst you 're saying three years if there was change in any of those risk management policies that they needed to be updated or renewed within the three-year period would it be reasonable to think that they would come to the table and be addressed anyway that 's my number one and then thank you Thank You councillor Pelt 's absolutely look council officers believe that policies living documents so that if there is any major impact on the content of those particular policies we will certainly be bringing that back as a fresh revision but given that the the work our with our risk management team and also in the Ohio net space that we were trying to align the periodic review of those policies back to three years because of the strength and the robust framework that they 're currently working with but absolutely if there is some significant change that needs to be brought forward in little into a policy then officers will attend to those if I may madam mere my second question was with regards to the 3v3 Raymond Island Ferry issues that haven 't_''_8081.89 been fully recognized stage I 'm just wondering if you could highlight what they were to counsel the group apologies counselor pelts I would have to take that on notice I don 't have the report up in front of me but I think that from memory that most of those were around some training on the operation operational procedures of that support the procurement policy and also some further training in regards to the font the procurement policy at a manager and coordinator level they 're still some officers that we haven 't had a chance to take through that three that I can recall thanks counsel Pelt 's any other questions no there 's a recommendation before us thanks counselor retain oh thanks counselor 2e speakers I put the motion to you all those in favor motion carried 05 point three point seven instrument of delegation Council to members of staff Mr Cashman thank you madam mayor so that report before you in relation to the instrument of delegation council members to staff is just a standard document that we provide to you and once we 've been acknowledged we 've been informed that updates have to be made to the powers or functions authorized to counsel staff this this version in particular takes into account the amendments made in June 2018 and December 2018 and primarily they revolve around the Heritage Act which has been replaced than the Heritage Act of 1995 which has been replaced by the Heritage Act 2017 there have been some extensive extensive changes to the Planning and Environment Act and the powers and functions available under the Act to council offices and for further if there have been any changes to officer titles to as well so the delegation has been reviewed at officer level and is considered appropriate for the ongoing administrative efficiency of councils so without any further questions I ask that the recommendation but you can see that thank you thanks miss Cushman are there any questions no thanks counselor tyno thanks counselor raves any speakers I kept up with the motion to you all those in favor motion carried 7-0 thanks mr. Cushman item six urgent another business no yep seven moving into camera counselor retainer madam mayor I 'd like to move council will now close the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 89 2d of the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item 7.1 as this item relates to contractual matters thanks counselor pouts all those in favor council buckley are you yep thank you motion carried _"

Bookout please refrain from calling out please refrain please refrain the second questions the second question we have to please mr. Bookout brain I have to I have two questions from mr.

Hyuga good evening can you hear me counsel I have two questions the first question is that given the environmental effects statement process undertaken in accordance with state legislation never seen by the state government agencies and participated in by council offices is yet to be concluded and that the environmental effects statement is yet to be finalized and published does counsel agree that the passing of a resolution now to oppose the fingerboards or contrary to the principles of good governance natural justice and due process and half council has considered the potential legal consequences of such a decision I would like to remind the gallery that you will be removed if you cannot be respectful mr. mr. Holden no I believe that is a question that is probably better answered by the elected leaders the the legal position in relation to any motion moved here in respect of the AES is not I think I say there I don 't believe there are I have to take that one I notice I 'm sorry because I don 't like how it 'll be legal the legal parameters of it Thank You mr. Holden mr. say do you have something to earn if if I could add I think in fact those those questions that have been raised here are actually going to be considered by council as part of the notices of motion in terms of the potential legal consequences which is which has been raised in the second notice of motion and I so I think those have been will be motion Thank You mr. CEO mr. Hugo yes my second question counsel is given the councilors obligation under the Local Government Act and the councilors code of conduct to provide good governance on behalf of the whole of the East Gippsland community and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the information upon which decisions or actions are based are factually correct what steps have counselors taken to inform themselves comprehensively of the facts regarding the impacts of the fingerboards project including seeking an independent expert advisor or state government agency advice regarding the potential environmental social and economic impacts of the proposed project and would the fact that an independent lack of research which indicates that I was 60% which indicates that over 60% of the East Gippsland community is yet to reach a conclusion on the results of the project to the relevance to be of relevance to the council 's consideration this evening Thank You mr. Holden the all of those matters would be covered in the environmental effects statement which would be provided to Council as part of the process and Council will have the opportunity the matters that do come forward in the environmental effects thank you mr. Holden Thank You mr. hero next question I 'm gonna me if I may I 'd like to move hang on to still got some more well we got more questions Thank You Man thank you madam mayor I missed this one said there 's in fact five questions so it 's from Peter Weir Neil Neil sorry trying to read the will the mere would you like to read your question that 'd be great thank you madam mayor thank you for the opportunity to do well that 's the question will the merit tell community and when will it met tell the community what it intends and when explain how council will handle the outburst by council at the council election evening Thank You mr. Neil as most of you would be aware we are currently undertaking a councillor code of conduct and following that process we have moved into the external mediation phase and that is currently underway so once that is has been resolved that will be made known thank you next I You councillor pouts okay there 's Pat him oh yeah put the motion to you all those in favor all those against okay motion carried it 's quite a number of speakers to speak to the notices of motion so I will ask you that you have five minutes and keep it to that time frame and I 'll just call you up as I have the order of paperwork so the first on my list is Miss Debbie Carruthers to speak to item 2.1 [Applause] thank you madam chair I 'm Debbie Carruthers coordinator of gas-filled freebandz Dale two years ago the East Gippsland sharp Council unanimously voted to ban fracking in response to mine licenses here and deep concerns raised by the community we 're extremely grateful to the council for that action taking this position sent a strong message to the victorian government in addition to other actions taken across the state it resulted in the government legislating for a permanent ban on fracking this is an example of council influencing an outcome before a government decision was made a gas company had been speaking with counsel the fracking ban was legislated was to protect agriculture agriculture needs our protection again from another major threat this proposed open cut 11 square kilometer mineral sands mine within 5500 of say that again within 500 meters of our food ball and 350 meters from the heritage-listed mitchell river that irrigates those crops supplies us with our drinking water is where we fish and tourists come to our Gippsland less protected ramps are wetlands we 've been told to wait for the results of the EES however that process is widely recognized as being flawed the 50 recommendations made to fundamentally overhaul it have never been implemented following a parliamentary inquiry in 2011 and an our general report in tooth in 2017 our local member timber was a member of that inquiry so he and anyone else who advocates that we wait for those results notes the EES process is like Swiss cheese with far too many holes in it to ask the community to wait and have confidence in it is laughable EEO processes are initiated when there are significant environmental issues so this is flat major warning bells people were initially saying there are acknowledged radioactive hazardous and highly toxic substances involved this is an inappropriate area for a mine the terrain is hilly full of steep gullies and is subject to East Coast lows with very heavy rainfall sometimes 100 millimetres in a day these gullies flow directly into the mitchell river there are regulation failures remember the Hazelwood mine fire and contamination events of aquifers lakes and rivers by mining companies bombs paid by mining companies only cover rehabilitation of the area mind not to disasters arising from them based on government ahead of the Australia Institute reported in July 2017 that only one of 150 miles operating in Victoria has ever been fully rehabilitated so based on that track record rehabilitation will never happen even though mining companies say it will Calabar has acknowledged that heaven though no experience as a mining company which is a very scary prospect when you consider the highly hazardous and radioactive substances involved even the big experienced mining companies such as bhp get it wrong remember our teddy a cow part staff member told me planning for their sixty event with climate change major weather events are likely to be more frequent and could happen many times during this years during this mines 20-year lifespan one thing we can be sure Mother Nature isn 't going to be reading the EES this month shouldn 't go ahead the risks are too great and they can 't_''_957.379 be controlled there 's no social licence for the mind to proceed with 82% of the directly impacted land holders saying they don 't want the mine on their land nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition to the Legislative Assembly I have them here and nearly 200 business owners and community group leaders have signed a petition to this council to state their opposition to the mine there are another two positions to petitions to the premier and the treasurer on change.org with over two thousand signatures I asked the council whether any motion has attracted so many signatures the Victorian government needs to listen to the concerns of the people who live in know the area and have to live with the consequences we are here tonight to express our deep ratepayers by sending a clear message now to the Minister for planning based in Melbourne who will decide the fate of this mine before you were elected as a councillor you were asked for your position on the mine it is reassuring to see the majority of you stated you were concerned about it and did not support the mine darling ahead we respectfully ask you to stand true to what you said thank you mrs. grose the councillor Roberts for putting forward this motion and we ask you to show your leadership on this because the past the community will only have 30 days to respond to the over 1,000 pages of the EES document when it 's released to the public let 's hope no one 's on leave at the time thank you thank you mrs. Carruthers I mean Sharon Claire Sharan quick please come to the microphone [Applause] Sharyn clerk please come to the microphone remind you that you only have five minutes to speak yep and we 've got a lot to get through so quick yes yes my name is Sharon clerk and I about lifestyle why I and many others chose to leaving Glen Ola Dale we own a class by calibre resources as affected land holders however we will suffer just as others in the mind footprint will we also pay rates unlike calibre our resources on any land they own in year Skip 's land this is water taken from my tap at Glen old Oh clean freshwater tank water no chemicals no additives clean fresh rainwater that has been independently tested as many others both in Glau a little and beyond have had done this is the sample taken from a core sample from Glen a litter the Rebs it 's an independent laboratory in Melbourne undergoing rigorous testing from all those nasties cow barks I want to be in the dust seep into the river blow across the Linda no Valley vegetables and the wood Glen storage supplying nineteen thousand four hundred households and two thousand three hundred and fifty commercial premises across East Gippsland I 've been advised to use gloves Anna may ask when opening this container mother 's eye thorium silicon just to name a few 's eyes a little bit of thorium a little bit of silicon mined out you that goes into your lungs just to name a few if a mineral cents mine was to proceed at Glenelg order this may be what most air skips Landers will drink when they turn on the tap not only from drinking water collected removes in glenelg Adal but all those that rely on our town water supply we come to glen elevator only skips land for a lifestyle clean drinking water green vegetables fresh air peace tranquility pristine rivers the Magnificent Gippsland lakes many of us are not born and bred here but perhaps in instance in many instances appreciate far more what East Gippsland has to offer and what a skip sign has to lose if calvo resources have their way i ask you the counselors of east gippsland would you be happy drinking this tainted glass of water not really knowing what you are drinking I suppose in reality it wouldn 't really matter to any of us if a mineral sands mine is supported by a skip saying Shire just don 't but it 's annulled bloody lifestyle thank you for your time this evening [Applause] thank you Miss clerk mr. Alan Solomon can you please come [Applause] I just reminded this five minutes on knowledge and pay my respects to the guy anomic people that lived on this land for many generations I like to pay my respect to elders past and present and I acknowledge young future can 't guide people today my name is Allen solar and I oppose against the mineral sand mining Glen a doll like you I stand here today with represent my local community this is one key there is one key word that we that I want to acknowledge that is respect if you say the welcome to country you need to respect it [Applause] welcome to catching inspector Organic people and our culture you need to respect the history tool and the environment whether we live in the stories that are related in in this area I want everyone to know what I say every time I hear it and go out to Glendale I hook it in two directions where it can imagine men on horses coming down with directions or bragging oh you had one thing in there born is what all tribes in that area chasing the tribe through Glen Ellyn after Scholl Craig hundreds of remains was found in scull Craig this is why Stan teachers a a power for terrible history that did happen and cannot be forgotten or can be can 't_''_1519.72 be cleared by our mind once it 's gone he 's gone it breaks my heart to see the mine go through and destroy that there was a bad history we can 't destroy it now I can ignore what what has happened I just want and what they do we want to show respect to the gunite people of this land respect they 're sure that your memory love mind Thank You mr. Solomon mr. Victor Hugo thank you it 's just a reminder of five minutes speaking time good evening my name is dr. Victor Hugo and the chief operating officer for caliber Resources Limited [Music] I 've been asked I asked to make a submission to Council regarding the motions three-stroke 2018 is kind of a strong preference to consult and work with all stakeholders regarding any concerns they may have about the environment and social impacts of the fingerboards project and it 's my intention tonight to assist Council to make a decision consistent with the council 's earned code of conduct and the principles of good governance I 'm sure that we 're all aware that the project has been assessed by the Victorian Government Minister for planning and that there is an NES process currently being undertaken in accordance with the environments effects and the project can only go ahead after assessment by government agencies and regulators based on factual evidence please desist from calling out and after the input of the community through an extensive public consultation process which involves an independent public inquiry hearing in which council and community submitters will be entirely in chargeable to participate 20 technical studies are nearing completion and the year 's report which will include these studies is expected to be lodged with the Department of Environment land water and planning in the first quarter of 2019 that 's just several the guidance of a review and guidance sorry under the guidance and review of a technical reference group which includes the East Gippsland Shire Council and at the request of the Shire Council and others three of the major specialist studies water rehabilitation and air quality will undergo an independent peer review as part of the process the purpose of these days is to identify the potential environmental social and economic aspects or impacts of the project and this information in some instances is helping us refine the project 's scope and develop mitigation and management measures to limit the project 's impact on the environment and the community the inclusion of various travel options in the es in preference to road haulage is an example of the responsiveness of calibre to this process and the entire community including council will have the opportunity to read digest and respond to these technical studies and the overall EES in the coming months under the Local Government Act we understand the councillors in their deliberations should act without bias and consider the greater good of the whole community in regard to the into an independent survey of community views on the fingerboards project which was completed in November this year in a random telephone survey of 152 people please please stop calling out in a random telephone survey of 152 people in the East Gippsland and Wellington regions the survey found that 65 percent of respondents had yet to make up their minds about the project for those people within the East Gippsland Shire of which there were 93 respondents and I 'm told there is representative over 60 percent of respondents had yet to make up their minds about the project the survey results suggest that the majority of the East Gippsland community please stop there is 20 seconds left wearing the outcome of the year 's protest before deciding whether they support or purpose of project and I would be happy to brief Council on the full results of the survey consulates I respectfully request that you consider your legal position [Music] Thank You mr. Hager and half supporting this motion at this stage will compromise your counselors ability [Music] members in the gallery you need to keep it down the same we keep interrupting let him finish let me repeat that counsels are respectfully requested you consider your legal position regarding this motion thank you mr. Hugo I 'll have to wrap you up there thank you thank you mr. Peter Raymond [Applause] I made a mint counselors staff my wife and I moved here four years ago from Sydney to a farm in Kalulu we bumped into a bunch of people in the area who seemed to be very happy and we said why are you so happy in the response was universally when you live in Paradise why wouldn 't you be I 'm not on the documentation that the council 's mission says a leading local government that works together with our communities to make East Gippsland the most liveable region in Australia it 's been very much like that my wife decided that as part of us moving here she would start up a bed-and-breakfast facility she was delighted to find that the council was very supportive of things that encourage tourism and so we are now operating in our third summer holiday season in said that they have been so delighted with its peaceful serenity and they 've said many times that the experience has been so wonderful they want to come back and they want to tell their friends about it as well the view from the cottage that are built with a friend just as well I had a friend because he knew what he was doing and gives us the views directly across the Linden if--let 's the Lindo reflects including the comms tower at fern Bank which is adjacent to where the Calbre resources have current property I can see directly from my bed-and-breakfast college the proposed mine site I wonder if my guests will say the same thing if they are able to see and hear the impacts of a mine such as its proposed incidentally in case you 're thinking that because I 'm in Kalulu it 's a long way away I can hear when the Linda no fire bill goes off and it 's confirmed when my pager goes off to say that you know the flagger Creek brigade has also been called the kappa site sure would be significantly more I 'm sure that would have a significant impact and it 's not just my accommodation I speak here as a if you like a potential victim impact statement and I know that there are other accommodation facilities similar to mine in the area one of which is actually approximately halfway between us and the mine site in the middle of a Linda no expanding on things a little I have neighbors in the Linda no flats area they employ many workers many more workers than the handful of mostly FIFO workers that would be employed by the mine many of these may lose their jobs in the event of a severe contamination that seems to me entirely too likely to happen despite these assurances from Cal bar that they will be mitigated I come from a project management background where risk is a core element of my responsibilities risk is measured as impact and likelihood measures and when you have high levels of likelihood combined with high levels of impact it 's a severe warning the things I look at as likely impacts that all of the details but you know Debbie Carruthers has mentioned many of them already the motion to rescind that I believe is in place you know there 's been suggested is I 've believed a bit of a fur fee a red herring because as has been mentioned there was already a council statement opposing the the fracking the substance of what we are requesting council is of the same magnitude at the same order of of impact the same type of activity when the council was elected the election was as representatives of the community of the people I urge you to take that responsibility to represent the community my wife happened to do a number of calls around the retail precinct and overwhelmingly people were horrified at what was going to be on the doorstep of the vegie growing areas as well as the town and once again I urge you to consider taking responsibility for representing the community thank you for you thank you mister Joanne aced Minh can you please come to the microphone my name is Joanne Eastman we have found land other side door to where we 've raised her children I 've been in the area for 40 years I came down from central Victoria I couldn 't believe what a beautiful bit of land Glen Oliver wants it 's gentle it 's got lovely valleys and hills and it 's so well trade the animals do really well there so many shelter trees if a mind goes out there there will be not one shelter tree on that space when Calabar talks about rehabilitation the may manage to try to keep those sadiq soils in place we 'll sterilize the soils you will find a barren clay pit after that mine has been there no farmer on this land now will ever be able to farm again I don 't know how you can expect we far mathematical analog Glen Ola Dale to tolerate things that you wouldn 't tolerate yourselves I first heard about the mine in November 2014 at a meeting at mossy face and I was horrified to hear that they were looking at Glen over there because there 's Rob Bishop said but I since denied that a handful of sheep farmers and a few lettuce growers he denies saying that I heard him every other person in that room heard him fact that shows a total lack of respect that he has shown to us all the way through I 've been to most of the meetings that calibre I 've had I 've never had satisfactory answers to any questions most recently I went to one where they gave supposin results of noise monitoring they only looked at noise from trucks which are quite had never been ever been before they haven 't hooked up noise from the mining unit plant we know if from down it dopplers mine people 12 kilometres away could hear the mining unit plan on still days and they said it sounded like a machine gun going off in their backyard you are asking my family to put up with that we have no chance of compensation no chance of moving from the land and we don 't want to it 's been in the family for over a hundred years my children love it my children grew up there calibers great new II 's is to close the road that we drove the stock on when asked by when asked Victor Hugo said or you can buy a truck well thank you very much mr. Hugo riding the horses driving the stock is part of the pleasure of being on the farm out there I 'm asking counsel consider what it 's like for people living out out at Glenelg Adel I 'm concerned about the risk further afield but I 'm deeply concerned for my family my kids love that farm my grandkids are coming up there now they love it too are they going to have to be outside with you pass on to tolerate the noise are they going to have to wear masks to put up with the dust we know from the Douglas mine but places five kilometres away had 20 times higher levels of radiation and the tank water there were there beforehand that 's why we 're doing independent testing you are asking people to put their health and lifestyles at risk their physical and emotional mental health at risk for something out a report two years ago that said that there are close to 18 new mines starting up mineral sands minds if you look at the report nearly all of them are going to produce more zircon and titanium dioxide than Calibur are going to Chara says we have to mine with the resources none of those other mines are going to go as deep as calibre as mine there has never been a mining in Australia that has had to deal with that team to recover product it is like digging up your backyard to find one people it is just ridiculous and they will never ever rehabilitate it I don 't think I 've got anything else to say I 'm just asking to have a bit pity on the people out there and with a thought for our land and Thank You Ellen for your comments about needing to respect the land and respect the people [Applause] Thank You mr. Eastman can I please ask David Warren to come to the microphone thank you very much for the opportunity to speak I 'm in support of the my name is David Warren I 'm president of the Gippsland Lakes recreation and fishing lines incorporated this incorporates three groups save our Lakes note let 's give you lakes and the gap the gap there is a good plan angling Club Association and it represents the recreational wrangling clubs of East Gippsland I have also a state council representative risk its land on the State Council of vo fish var fish is the peak representational recreational body that advises government in the state of Victoria on recreational fishing there are we represent 840,000 recreational anglers and we are opposed this mine we 're opposed to the development of this mine or any mine including the development of the old Stockman mine at benamber which poses an unacceptable threat to the Gippsland lakes the contamination or demand for water it 's been lifes as you 've heard it here tonight a rents are listed there a drought refuge for birds and other protected or endangered species the recently elected state labor government committed to remove commercial Nets from the Gippsland Lakes they also committed to address the significance that they and likes the reasons for this commitment worth it was proper recreational fishing tourism in the Gippsland lakes the recognition that the Gibson and likes are a significant asset to East Gippsland attracting people who enjoy a wide range of activities associated with the Gippsland Lakes this will involve from suitable commitments over many years to address habitat and ecological deterioration in the Gippsland Lakes the recognition that the gift Land O 'Lakes are under considerable stress from reduced freshwater flows and from increased harvesting and reduced rainfall patterns over the last 50 years aquatic former and for including asturian habitat is threatened by increasing salinity as well as industrial agricultural pollution and nutrient runoff the due to a significant decline in the iconic fish species over the last 30 years like backroom dusky Flathead estuary perch an Australian best considerable restocking will be required restocking has become essential in many of Victoria 's water waves because conditions are not conducive to actual recruitment these conditions are reflective of poor management inappropriate development as well as climate change the complexity of the problems to be resolved do not need further level the Gibbs native lakes are a significant asset to East Gippsland in the state of Victoria any development which risks an adverse event that runs the risk of polluting the rivers of the Gippsland Lakes is unacceptable to the Victorian recreational fishing community the Victorian Government has invested 46 million dollars over the last four years in its target 1 million program with critical programs of restocking and improving fishing facilities to encourage recovery the andrews Labour government will continue this restocking program as part of its target 1 million in the last four years six million of the fish were released in the Victorian waterways intention is to grow this to 10 min over the next four years recently there are over 57,000 destory perch and Australian bass released into the rivers of the Gippsland Lakes this is a beginning of considerable investment in East Gippsland by a state labour government I have been informed by the VFA the Victorian fisheries authority but further stocking of dusky flattened and possibly black brim will be undertaken when commercial nets are finally removed from the Gippsland Lakes I 'll have you [Applause] thank you can I please ask mr. John Han to come to the microphone [Applause] yeah I 'm John Hein a veggie ground on the flat aim down we 've been at there for 40 42 years on the on the farm ground rock lie colonies cabbage very various loins and the farm is is just forth 500 meters from the from the mine site which which worries us immensely we 're very worried about a lot of issues like dust than that but I 'm here to represent about 80% of the veggie growers there 's there 's still 80% there 's still about a few still waiting for that yes process which I I think will be a big worry we 're consumed dust would be one of our major concerns when you look at six to eight hundred acres of overburden sitting up on top of the hill there I 've seen the dust blow on beat air from window they 're hitting um hitting mount tail up at times you know dust um trampling that far so that dust will will fly across in nasty things in the well we feel there 's nasty things in their young will be in the so yeah the insurance program which is is um we must have fun no contamination at all which is zero tolerance to run foreign matter so if we get a hit with dust contamination it won 't be just it won 't be just our sit weight we just would Glenn it 'll be the whole whole in no plates will be will be on the threat like I mean you look at strawberries in um in Queensland they might have been growing at dumb stand or but they all all put in the one package points I in strawberries you know stuff are they yeah so a lot of businesses rely on the Lindo flex to to survive like all the flour and effect of all that dumb that 's off of it you looking at 20% McDonald 's lettuces come from the only no place I 'll be 30 to 50% of the fresh produce going to the markets come from a little in Knight flats so dust you know business so we worked hard to get a get that up and running the whole we know platters I 'm one of most beautiful places clean and green and we really can 't afford the risk it 's good in any way like we got the wood Glen scoodle which are you know they rely on tank water they have play group said is 20 it 's a little baby 's there every week for play groups the school still operating kinda hard from the young from the mines own mine site which is poor not be a when its wins Milan T strong water on the river the water we use it for a rum watching the veggies to irrigate we make ice from the water any of any contamination in that water supply well we just can 't afford to any have any contamination front run up from the mine site which is they claim that they can put block the gullies they can block the gullies and treat the water back but when we get the big gun the big rains out there they 'll never the it won 't work not in a million years I 've been there not seen it coming out of the gullies and now you 're going to stick straight feet of water company have 3 gullies coming near me into the river and I fall 5 an amazing River got my claim they 're gonna when asked where they um have you know how long would they be needed near the river the 500 meters same I saw we only there a little while well a little while might mean say um is that dumb well it takes from the time they start digging to when they rebuilt those five years so I don 't think a little while that 's not a little while that 's that 's my years of operation within 500 meters of the river so you know that they 're purely you know the points yeah some of the veggie growls organic growers so they 've got a very very their certificate is just zero to everything I we 've got a clean green image out there one of the best in Australia I reckon _''_3240.93 _''_3241.86 affected by this some I just can 't believe they you don 't try and put a mine in this this side it 's just completely completely not not suitable that I 'm not against mining or industry or anything like that but that that location is just hugely wrong just shouldn 't have her home I just have nightmares over it like you know I 'm not down he won all these people here we 're all here and we not eat for the fun of it I 'll have to ask you to finish that mr. Hahn sorry I 'm sorry thank you [Applause] mr. Neil bear claw mr. reminder there 's five minutes yeah thank you madam mayor Thank You counselors just bit of background up taking the nearest employment and particularly mega droughts that have affected the world for about the last 35 years perhaps 30 to 50 year droughts devastated Peruvian communities 550 a day 1100 AD and I became particularly interested in these droughts when I had my attention drawn to evidence of similar droughts in Australia I 've sent the counselors an email I put in in January 2009 which details the swamp on the Marin BT hundred acre swamp Lagoon it fills up every time I think the memory of the Marlin BG floods 223 feet and if they don 't get a flood 223 feet for ten years it dries right out it has dried out twice since European settlement around 1840 it was dry for about three months in 1915 and it was dry from 1945 to there 1950 now the interesting thing about it is there are said to be 50-year old dead trees in the bottom of this swamp so sometime in the recent past we 've had like a 60 year mega drought which of course this swamp to dry out now there 's a similar example down at Longford where ie swamp dried out the first time in 1914 15 to reveal 50 year old dead trees in the bottom of it but that swamp is now diversity gained totally surrounded by pines so it is normally or very often now quite dry but up from the 1840s to 1915 it hadn 't dried out when the bottom of it Carr 's Creek down at sea spray there 's a hundred foot long pool 30 foot wide 30 foot deep they had a very dry period early to mid 1940s and there 's a pool in it it 's never been known to have done it before but it drops the creek stopped running and it dropped about two meter to reveal the branches of a dead tree growing out from under the waterline now we 've had the same mega droughts in the past that like wiped out the Peruvian civilizations and rainfall in we have enough rainfall record to see that rainfall follows solar activity and the higher solar activity the higher the rainfall the period from the 1940s to 1996 is said to be anywhere from the highest solar activity for four thousand years to eight thousand years so what we think of as normal is very likely a one in a thousand or one in eight thousand year high now I 've emailed your link to a new sign to started to lose 1989 from memory where it details how every two five decades of low solar activity and that link says it early this century we will be returning to that period of low solar activity now I was a speaker at a forum organized by the East Gippsland wildfire task force in October 2005 and I detailed this and I said in the near future we are very likely going to be approaching a period of very low solar activity that will go for several decades at that time the world sign solar scientists were all saying the opposite they 're saying we 're facing what we 're expecting very high solar activity by 2009 the world 's solar scientists have changed the saying that we 're headed for a period of very low solar activity and now this Universal virtually universal acceptance amongst the solar scientists that we 're looking at probably three to five decades a very low solar activity so we are almost certainly going into the same climatic conditions that put the dried up the swamp on the morrow BG dried up the swamp but Longford for like maybe 60 years so we are that is into and the council not to oppose the allocation of water de cobre would be simply negligent if you can 't challenge anything I 'm saying I 've sent you an email you are welcome to challenge anything I 've said I invite you to but simply waiting for an EAS which is a means of basically absolving the decision makers such as yourself and state government from the responsibility they can simply then the mining company can simply employ consultants put up a dodgy a yes and it takes away your responsibility you have to regain that responsibility Thank You mr. Barrow cough [Applause] dr. Nikola Watts can you please come to the microphone sturm ID have five minutes thanks madam mayor and councillors my name is Nicola watts and I 'd just like to acknowledge obviously the deep and heartfelt concerns that are being expressed here by individuals I 'm not here though presenting on the behalf of myself I 'm here on behalf of the East Gippsland food cluster we 're a collaborative network of regional agri-food businesses who look after the sustainable development of our important a group of food actually underpins our regional economy and our region plays a very strong role in Victoria and Australia 's food supply chains our region is well positioned to continue to play a vital role in local domestic and global supply chains and food security into the future the East Gippsland food cluster together with local and state government partners is working very hard to build on from this strong regional base in Agra food and position the region excuse me as a premium food and wine production area together with East Gippsland marketing we 've been implementing a regional produce branding strategy the East Gippsland produce naturally good brand which is not only designed to support our agri-food sector but also encourage further regional visitation all of this is premise on East Gippsland clean green environment and image [Applause] like Luke Custer has been broadly concerned about potential negative impacts of mining on the agri-food sector and in August of 2017 unanimously moved emotion that the East Gippsland food cluster is not supportive of any form of mining activities that pose a threat to prime agricultural land cluster is concerned about the potential impacts of the proposed minerals sands mine these threats are considered as both perceived that is they could detract from the clean and green image of our region amongst customers as well as real that is they present threats to land soil and water the East Gippsland food cluster therefore believes that a highly risk of this approach needs to be adopted in relation to this matter however having said that the food cluster is also aware of the Victorian Government 's environmental effects statement we do respect that process and are awaiting the outcomes of that process many of our members are actually actively engaged and being in consultant in that process we want to see an EIS which provides a clear evidence base of the risks the significance of those risks the requirements the full requirements of mitigating those risks and full consideration of whether those risks can be adequately mitigated we will await the outcomes of that es when it 's available in 2019 where we hope we have a shared and public document and on the basis of that we es process itself and determine the extent to which the mine does propose a threat to our prime agricultural land waterways and aquifers in eastern Gippsland and whether we may need to make more comprehensive submissions into the further es process thank you thank you dr. Weiss miss Ava Harris me good evening counselors my name is Eva I 'm 12 years old I 'm not as big as you are that 's because I 'm still child I 'm too young to vote but that doesn 't mean I can 't speak out I have a clear brain and a strong voice how many other people like me who can 't vote do you think there are East Gippsland maybe 20,000 or even more and yet there is silence who speaks for them tonight I do if they were all here with me tonight they 'd fill the whole building and the gardens outside and right down Main Street please don 't gamble through our future please advise the government that you stand against this toxic mind that will destroy that it makes East Gippsland imagine it 's beautiful lecture us kids about not taking risks especially not to gamble and this is what you are allowing you are gambling of our future please I heard you don 't down below our inheritance I may be only one little person but the thousands of thousands of children I around a snipe we were excited councillor Roberts was elected the youngest councillor in this Shire we thought perhaps then we would now have a voice he cares about our future that 's what tonight is about please as grown-ups acts for the future generations time is running out our future is in your hands [Applause] Thank You Ava mr. Ellen Sheridan can you please come to the microphone we 're local people we came in in 1959 and since then I 've worked in the stock and station agency business I started in an area from Woodside through a truckin up to date only open ambra delegate and make the band start initially with the new zealand load later on i work mainly from Stretford through but yeah as much of the Australian estates account that aid rates that I was I 've saw I was involved in selling at well over 40 farms as well as a lot I was responsible for anything the cattle sales for the estates of benamber and I instigated the the cattle sales that delegate the circuits cattle start betting on nearly every farm in that district that rent sheepmen and most of the ones that rent cattle in my time in that in that business so I don 't agree I 'm a practical person and I 've understand the end I understand the value of land I worked on the valuation group for each key player on the team brochure for running purposes for a year which was we could certainly the local government and and the rating system and they were inequitable these for farmers block you don 't want to get out of that subject tonight what concerns me about this project is when you look around that huge area about ships land and then you go and stand on the bank of the Mitchell River with all that knowledge of land what land is worth what all carry and of John Hines farm and you look across the river and you think to yourself in that whole area keeps laying there is not a more unsuitable place to put them on my main concern is aquifers on the ridge um plane we have on our farm where do we live 63 troughs if the aquifer was stucked up which they 'll all tell us it won 't be but we heard that in the people of Woodside heard that years ago ask him what happened to them and also their son and he 's fat only three children have a farm at work and they were discussing this with a caliper I 'd like and he said you 've got nothing to worry about well you were and they had really said to him wait you see where your thighs and Hasen yeah that 's where my house is and you 're saying that 's in a direct line of the prevailing winds this is the stories that these people will try and put a lien they work with a lot of con me I saw a con on walk there of one of them let me know if you ever I 've seen him up a con men Thank You mr. Sharon out please don 't very much thank you [Applause] a member from the band 's Dale cookery Youth Council [Applause] mr. Aman do you have five minutes thank you very much Casey Ricci 's speaking on behalf of the crude youth council before I start the band stop for Youth Council proudly acknowledges that gonna occur in our people we acknowledge their reach and continuous culture and pay respect to their elders past president and emerging we acknowledge the Ghanaian people as the first peoples and traditional owners and custodians of the land and water on which we live work and play we show respect to the gunner can our people by conducting our business accordingly and in the best interest of all the Aboriginal and non-aboriginal paper we work with them we recognize and value the ongoing contribution of the gonna turn our peoples and we embrace the spirit of self-determination and reconciliation working towards a shared vision of equality and ensuring an unbiased voice of a mind going in after hearing those stories physically making me sicker on behalf of the Banzhaf crew Youth Council in the wider Aboriginal community we say no to any form of mining developments in our community most of you may know most of you may know East Gippsland has some of the oldest and most substantial cultural sites in the world these cultural sites provided a valuable insight into the rich history of the land the rock formations ceremonial sites been trading and hunting grounds bound in and around Clement Glen itaú are extremely meaningful to our gonna be on our people and it 's preservation is vitally important for our identity and the continuation of our rich cultural heritage as a community many of these sites and more are facing threats from mining developments and the proposed mine will unequivocally affect our ancient local history as a community we cannot let this happen we also know our region is proudly home to some of the best quality farming lands in Victoria develop your mind here will affect every farm and resident in and around the southeast area a year Linda no fights vegetable growing industry and it will jeopardize our load our local fishing and touring tourism industries it is proven in other areas both nationally and internationally that mining causes a colossal and irreversible damage to the environment we do not want to see this happen in our beautiful Gippsland lakes and surrounds which is home to many the risks associated with del of it developing a mind prevail over in any benefits if any furthermore we know that if Martin goes ahead it will no negatively affects people plants and animals by forcing them from their homes and their lands preventing them from accessing clean water and land it will impact on our culture health and livelihoods and those of our future generations it causes divisions and communities and it changes the social dynamic because as a community as we 've seen tonight these impacts are exacerbated when our local people aren 't consulted and we 're not given any form of information about a planned mind even or us is when people are not giving a say on whether or not a man a want to reiterate that this is that it is extremely important that these lands are not disturbed and the locations that tell a story behind this land are not destroyed in the name of mining development we want to keep this land strong and healthy for all of our children so they can go out push hunting and fishing in safe in a safe clean environment without water and with that clean country none of us can survive we all need to come together for the future of our children and their children for many Aboriginal people for the people of South East Gippsland and for our wildlife and ecosystems land is life which means more than a mere source of income and it is extremely important that we collectively fight this mine all the way to the end thank you [Applause] Thank You mr. Richie the last speaker is George near fighter George is here he 's speaking on George 's behalf thank you madam mayor I 'm speaking on behalf of George neophyte Oh barrister and solicitor who is not able to attend tonight for health reasons the legal advice in making a decision on council Robert 's notice of motion the notice of motion in question is a political decision and not a legal one well aware that the decision to proceed with the proposed fingerboards mineral sands mine is a Victorian government decision any decision by Council would be clearly ultra vires that 's it allows seeking advice in this respect is pointless in essence council has not a legal power to inquire about the real issue and focus here is counsel can have a political view on the subject mind and whether it should exercise it the motion framed by the labor member councillor mark Reeves appears to be directed by the Victorian Labour government to interfere with or stifle the Independence of the East Gippsland Shire Council from actually actually having an opinion and more importantly seeks to take away counsels miss Wagner can I think that relates to the next motion sorry that relates to the next motion so can you please keep it relevant to sorry now the independence of the East Gippsland Shire Council from actually having an opinion and more the extractive mining activities with its jurisdiction and determining its suitability we are lucky to have a diverse council with considerable experience and local knowledge who are capable of deciding whether a project is appropriate given competing uses of land the primary issue with this mining project is there is a long-term extremely viable use of this land and one news cannot live next door to the other news and no environmental management generations can change this I consider counsel should have been expressing its opinion from the very start and even sought the responsible ministers intervention to overturn the project in this dominant agricultural area far too much emphasis is placed on the monetary benefits of the mining project by comparing the financial values of agricultural Returns versus mining returns in economics a social science the comparison is the benefit to society of a healthy agricultural industry supplying 30 to 50 percent of vegetable production to Melbourne markets that can grow exponentially with increased water allocations opposed to an extractive industry that predominantly supplies pigments and ceramic materials the latter is obviously not a real necessity to society and epicenter of mining and given our lake system a high risk to convey contaminants too far beyond destinations I urge councillors not to be deterred in fulfilling a decision to actively oppose the project by bringing to this misguided advance to obtain legal advice I have heard a number of alarming and false accusations leveled at councillors even threats of legal action if these statements are true they are made to essentially intimidate you from taking a stand and in fact our baseless at law [Applause] three-straight it is within councils purview to take a position on the mine without requiring legal advice as with all decisions by councillors not everyone may agree or liked the outcome but as the executive and civic leaders you need to take a course for the overriding benefit of everyone in the shire as your charter defines a refusal of this notice of motion does not bar you from participation in all the steps open in the environmental effects statement process or in any points listed in the counsel of Reeves rationale thank you miss Wagner [Applause] okay 2.1 notice of motion number three like to move it I was waiting for counsel Roberts sorry Otis wanted on my computer madam mayor boss councillor roberts is seeking his notes is there any comment from any officer in relation to this presentation this evening take notice that is my intention to move at the ordinary council or ordinary meeting of council to be held on Tuesday the 11th of December 2018 at 6 p.m. or any adjournment to that meeting that council in the interests of a sustainable East Gippsland economy society and environment will protect the long-term viability of East Gippsland agriculture and tourism industries and ensure the voice of the East Gippsland community is heard by 0.1 stating our opposition to a proposed mineral sands mine proceeding in the Glen al-adel area and point to writing to the premier appropriate federal state federal state and shadow ministers advising them of council and the community 's position on this matter and asking for their support in actively prosecuting this motion both in Parliament and in public to protect us keeps land I assume that councillors have read the rationale and I don 't think of the gallery have already said so I 'll leave it there [Applause] second down would you like to address the gallery thank you madam mayor I would I would like to begin by saying that as elected councillors we have been bigger than a charter to represent people of East Gippsland and seeing so many people here in the gallery I must say that either you were great because us of the older generation we may if this mind goes ahead we may never even see the end of it but what air passion is as citizens of this community is to try and protect our region for the younger generation that is your charter I I like many of the speakers here tonight I 'm not against mining but we find that this mine side is in the worst possible position Maurice Gippsland the risks could well the risks are tremendous the possibility of something happening in the 20 years could be devastating to our area so I support councillor Roberts motion and urge others around the table to support it also because the you know the you gallery tonight are a small portion of our community and you most of you don 't live in Glen our doubt you live in East Gippsland so you understand the possibilities of what could happen to our entire region not just those people who live in Clinton holiday so please support this motion madam madam mayor if I may take your indulgence before any other further debate commences I 'd like to put to the bench here this evening several to two amendments to councilor Roberts 's motion that is before us I 'd like that if I may have your indulgence to put those before you have to be accepted by council Roberts are you prepared to listen to the amendments counsel Robert with with all due respect to to counselor Ellis and I appreciate his point of view and over I 've I 've read his amendment side and then mostly it 's 99% the same thing but I believe that the motion on the table now is more direct and it sends a clear message so I can 't support it Madame meer perhaps if you were under more understandable but what I 've got to say and I think council Roberts will appreciate that sorry counselor Alice I 'll have to defer to you okay so if counselor Ellis is moving an amendment we are able to hear it but he would need a seconder for it to get up thank you thank you madam mayor well I 'll put I 'll put the amendment to council and then seek a second day if I don 't gain a seconder then my amendment will fail okay I 'll read it to you it 's very simple and it 's ending search and commencing from with the basis of councillor Roberts 's motion and that is we need to listen to it first before it 's seconded view that council and the and the amendment is find and I introduced the words in representing the wishes of its community near the that 's the amendment and in the interests of a sustainable East Gippsland economy society and environment will work to protect the long-term viability of these Kipling 's agriculture and tourism industries whilst ensuring the voice the community 's opposition to proposed more mineral sands mining proceeding in and I have changed the wording there my amendment is the East Gippsland region my words then continue writing to the premier appropriate federal state and chato ministers advising them of councils and the community 's position on this matter and asking for their support in actively prosecuting this position both in Parliament and in the public to protect the skips land 3 a new amendment writing to our local federal member mr. darren chester and our local state representative mr. tim ball advising them of council councils and the community 's position requesting that they publicly support their community by undertaking the actions requested in dot point to of council Robert 's motion and for that such actions be undertaken in an efficient and timely manner there are they mi and minutes I six someone to chicken that verification please madam me counselor Ellis I 'm just curious you 've changed the words to the East Gippsland region and we 're actually just talking about the fingerboard site being the most inappropriate and I think that hearing site which is inappropriate I 'm just trying to get please in the gallery please become to assist do a council of elders the mineral deposits at Sand Ridge stretch from the fingerboard to Glen aladár right through to mossy face so what what effects Glen Ellyn Dale in the in the immediate period or will affect mossy face potentially into the future and that is why I 've asked for this amendment to be considered I just point to the gallery and to my council colleagues there was a proposed mineral sands project and correct me if I 'm wrong and it was at the down now an hour in the bush there and I was wondering if I could character that was an iron all right thank you I 'm getting the two mixed up Thank You councillor Ellis have a second are buckling councillor Buckley thank you just ask for a quick point of clarification from the CEO sorry yeah it 's an easy one if councillor Alice 's motion is to is not carried now council council Ellis 's amendment does that default back to okay this matter it 's clear that we 'll even by looking at the representation here this evening that this is an issue of community of which council is an integral part of it and a voice of the community resulting Lee I felt that the introduction of those those wishes that comment on wishes would would give strength to the community know that council is listening and that we we have taken into account the the drive off councillor Roberts 's motion secondly the introduction of the East Gippsland region is as I have explained in my response to councillor Phelps that it covers the wider area that is of concern to us all the the request for the local federal members is just an extension of on the voice of the community and it would cost bigger their choice but I would bring it to their attention and we 're in relation to the final point point for that be undertaken an efficient and timely manner you know I this issue has been going on for a number of year quite a number of years started with the issue region and it 's a continuing problem and it needs to be addressed sooner than later so instead of allowing it to go through the system and sit there we want to raise this concern I will speak further in in this process but that 's the basis of my amendment my request for the amendments thank you madam ma 'am thank you councillor Buckley okay as I see it this had strengthens council Roberts emotion and so the more ammunition he can get you know the stronger exam so thank you for that counselor counselor pouts you had a question information about we went to support this about the legal part of it whether we if we were to support this what the legal implications were if we were to support this what the legal implications are to the councillors just to clarify that question if you 're asking me the question on the legal basis of this is to the amendment yeah are you asking this to the amendment I say that it changes nothing in pets taking on board councilor or at least comments it strengthens and in terms of or not we do what 's going to address the matter of the legalized issues in my words at a later time but simply I 'll say to you if you recall how we dealt with the issue of fracking council was not impeded by any threats of legal action or impairment this action here this evening what if councilors councilor Roberts 's emotion is successful does not impede in any way the undertakings of the environmental effects statement that is an action I have managed at state level and the decision-makers in that level the man is the man is the Minister for planning council he will not be making any decision in relation to the environmental effects statement that 's a separate action this is here represent this issue is about representing the will and concern of our community speakers against the motion I 'd like to speak to the motion if I may to the amendment why not get another shot so we as counselors are democratically elected by the residents and the ratepayers of East Gippsland once elected we are responsible for reviewing an oath of office to carry out this role in partially and to the best of our ability and in the best interests of our municipality that last point is the most important without the residents and the ratepayers none of us would be around the table this evening the motion I have brought to the table tonight correction the motion that councillor Alice has amended tonight is requesting that this council on behalf of a concerned community states its opposition to the mineral sands mining project at Glen Holliday oh and East Gippsland approximately 3,000 individuals 200 businesses and 83% of the affected land holders have stated their opposition to the project and we cannot ignore them opposing councillors may say that we must follow the due process and wait for the AES to be submitted and while I totally agree in following process counsel must also be vigilant it must constantly review its processes and always be working to achieve the best outcomes for the community since the year 2002 reviews and a parliamentary inquiry have focused on the environmental effects Act in the EES process they found like in clarity and transparency between 2013 the year 2000 and 2013 successive governments committed to reforming the es process yet no significant legislative changes have occurred opposing councillors may say that if this motion is carried then we 'll lose the ability to make a submission to the EES when it is released however we 've been advised by council officers who have advised that the adoption of such a resolution would not prevent councils further involvement in the EAS process or the technical reference group I 'm all sort of I will also remind those councillors that only one mine has been denied approval staged the process so what good is making a submission to the EES if it falls on apparently deaf ears so while I believe in following due process we can 't sit on our hands while a large employer that reportedly earns 200 million dollars per year our ramps are wetlands and the Gippsland lakes are potentially put at risk by this project that is subject to a flawed es process some may say that I 'm being partial but that is incorrect I and the community does not want this mine fellow councillors I urge you to consider this amendment the motion will not stop the Arias from going ahead however it sends a clear message to our state and federal representatives the community does not want this mine pattern question counselor pelts thank you with our research all the counselors that have attended many you know many hours about this item that we 're discussing some of us have traveled to Western Australia and had a look at some of the comparable ones hear me out hear me out I have a right to speak at this table and I 'd like to say when I came back from the first journey I actually saw no issues with it recently only last month we actually traveled to the western side of the Staton and our officer of director Paul Holton 's put a really great program together and we were able to talk to other counts like councils that actually had had that had mines mineral sand mines operating in their areas and we were able to talk with the councillors directly what actually happened and for I just want the community to know that we have really my look look had some really good research into this their their input was fantastic they put us in directions that we actually had no idea about and they put us on the front line of how to cope with a mining such as this in their regions some of the sneaky stuff that went on and some of the implications that were very relevant to what you 're all saying tonight and we hear you and we 're saying yes this is something that we 're appeared to but as leaders in the process and someone that actually has an input into keeping the community safe I can hear what you 're all saying is a mag native group but I 'm also conscious of what is behind the scenes and what needs to be adhered to policy wise that our community if we say now this is what I 'm conflicted with if we say now don 't want this it 's not going to go away it 's still going to has the final say in this issue so for me to make a decision on this tonight I need to be moving and please you agree with the community better my counties can 't slip out I had a verification voice now my bottom line is to be able to fully protect the community there 's a whole lot of issues that happen in the planning section in the planning area that if we if we commit ourselves to this tonight we may not have a say in it might be taken out of our hands excuse me well land a spaceship but the bottom line is we we are actually the drivers in the community seat and for this to happen I 'm really cautious of and whilst I fully agree with what 's going on here I actually am reserved in committing a vote towards this because of the implications behind the scene that will protect the community more excuse me if you cannot be respectful in here you will be asked to leave one of the things we actually saw from the Horsham council was the fact to have the the extractions from their community in the farming areas and then the next thing was the processing plant and they ended up with this really huge dump site which was then considered a waste facility and that was the thing for me that actually turned around in the process and they actually said that there were extractions in the way of uranium and various other heavy metal issues that were contaminants too as an our cost of the mining sector and they were actually then bringing other contaminants in from South Australia and other various other places and dumping them at this site so to me I 'm looking at it and the issue arose because it was actually a change in their working plan which was actually part of the given fact that they could mine their which was given to them from the minister and their council had voiced their opinion and that opportunity to voice against the change in the plan was then taken away from their council because they had decided they didn 't want that in their community so for me well heard from our journeys from afar and we have done a lot of keep it down and I hope that I hope that they 've learnt from it and I hope we can actually use it to our advantage in our region so with that said I 'd just like to leave it at that thank you Thank You councillor pout any further speakers for or against madam mayor due respect I just remind everyone that we are still adopting the amendments to the substantive motion and I 'm not no and not and I 'm not seeking any conversations in relation to the the ultimate notion we 're still at that amendment stage okay so I suggested mr. council return I 'd like to speak I think he 's indicating that that yep okay so I put the I 'm reluctantly speaking against the amendment I 've been part of this East Gippsland community for best part of 60 years and I am passionate and the people around this room and passionate and I 'll respect that dr. Nicola watts also knows that I 'm passionate about the agri-food best part of 30 years of my working life have been a significant contributor to the agri-food sector in Londono in helping grow that sector I do want to talk about the issue because I don 't know for people that don 't know me I don 't like to play the person I tackle the issue and I would respect anybody 's opinion in this room and all I asked if they 'd respect my opinion whether they agree with it or not I would like to better understand the extent to which this motion does impede the current councilors this current council or future councils in relation to our statutory obligations prior to taking this position at the completion of the AES and we all know and it 's been said here a couple of times tonight that mining approvals are granted by the state government we know that as local government officials we need to understand these proposals and the impacts on this community our community and end on the whole region you know we 've heard people talk about we must deal and and support our in facts as much as I have a personal a very strong personal opinion in relation to the agri-food sector in its region and certain issues that may impact on that they are my personal views and I can 't see that by taking a predetermined position right now as much as whatever my personal views might be can help us making a solid well thought-out_,_6574.619 decision once we have all the facts please keep it down be respectful we were respectful listening to you it was there was a couple of comments and and I think young Eva for her presentation tonight was really heartfelt and does mean a lot to me I also picked up on the the comment from the the youth the curry youth group and particularly the the comments around this social dynamic is changing and and there has been a lot of galvanization and and polarizing views in relation to this mind but unfortunately right here now I can 't personally support this motion thank you Thank You councillor e no you need to write a reply because I 'm just wondering if I 're still talking madam me to the amendment to the motion not to the substantive motion and I think that 's where the last couple of schools have been going and I 'm asking the councilors to think about the words that I 've introduced to council Roberts 's substantive motion and I ask you to support my amendments and to not get confused with your positions in relation to that the basis of the substantive motion so your amendment to the vote I 'm asking to do that now he is thinking okay all those in favor of the amendment please sure it 's a four against four for four all those are against it 's three so the motion is carried the amendment is carried and we are now the amendment now becomes the motion Thank You councillor retainer okay we 've pretty well spoken to the substantive motion but there 's a couple of things I would like to say on a run through the notes first of all I want to congratulate councillor Roberts as a youngest councillor by having the courage to put up such and research it 's been well thought out he 's arguments this is a tough subject for us to deal with but we were elected to make these decisions and that 's what we 're here for this evening now I 'm going to flick through if you could council can just bear with me a flick through so I don 't repeat a lot of the words that have been said we 've ignore own councillor returned a right and rightfully identified some of the great speakers and I want to thank him for the round giving those young people that support that was good work and and their work there I want to also add no couple of things so we 're not blurring things one is that I made a note here is it is acknowledging that the proponents of the mine have acted within the law and are following the appropriate processes an example of this is the intended creation of a well-researched environmental effects statement it would be tried of council or anyone really say in not following the rulebook it 's that process that says the environment effects statement is in effect but an assessment process to provide authoritative advice to the statutory decision-makers and that any decision is on hold until the ministers assessment is made and considered the decision is the minister is the decision-maker not Council we are of course represented and variably by director Halton on the technical reference group which to the environmental effects statement that committee would technical boys from a local and he provides technical advice from our local government perspective he is not representing the community or its position and there 's not being charged to do so so any attack on him would be a very injustice kip over more on the environmental fixed statement i should also remind councillors that advice has been provided by a senior office of dull that any decision of council regard to sand mining will not inhibit further interaction by counsel in the processes leading to the granting of eliza 's to mine regardless of the position taken by council that is you know in in the process and he was referring to the activities of the technical reference that the wider wider situation and on that point I should remind councillors have been involved in the pastor and taken strong stands in relation to opposition to mining without counsel being placed in any form of peril or enabled to function appropriately it was pleasing to note this evening I had to see former councillor Peter Neil here this evening Peter was a very strong opponent of the concept of fracking and strongly supported arguments against fracking in this very chamber thank you Peter that we are not alone in possessing mineral stacks deposits in Victoria are estimated be two hundred and sixty million tonnes including eight million tonnes of root rutile and six million tonnes of zircon much of these deposits are situated in the Western District where a 50-year reserve our sands has been estimated like councillor peltor should also mention that my eyes were opened by the community interaction and the experiences of the two local councillors itself and grampians council at Hamilton where they had the processing plan and then the packs on the right payers and counsel in the city rural city apportion I and frankness it was really wonderful to meet for those people after we left the mine and I should also say the people from the miner de Luca were also most helpful and informative I 'm just gonna see I don 't think I need to go on about that now on on a trip Louis I saw this the other night when I was thinking about how how important these are and I just want to remind cancer that the environment affects statement is not an infallible process and and I was reminded of that even though going through some serious rig I can remind you of the VicRoads Ballarat highway era is a term used in this case an environmental fixed statement recommended that 221 large old trees are budding the Western Highway they 've been removed as part of an upgrade of the highway in reality there were thirteen hundred and fifty trees to 600 percent error and all of those trees were removed when an inquiry clearly showed a paucity and consultation or counting on tree so to speak so that 's that 's a real to partake in the process but to remain true to our roles as counselors counselors are a commend councillor Roberts motion before you and urge you to all support him and as I said I congratulate you for the quality and degree of thought you 're putting to your first notion before council thank you thank you either any further speakers are for the nail motion speakers against any other speakers yeah so no other speakers okay if there 's no other speakers I will put the motion before you all those in favor all those against motion is carried for three [Applause] I 'm a demerit like to suspend Standing Orders so the gallery can clear if they want to what about 2.30 I 've still got another notice of motion okay yes thank you okay we 've got some speakers to the next notice of motion number four 2018 Council Robert 's notice I doing okay okay do we have a seconder to bring that forward thanks counselor Ellis we 're just bringing forward the next notice of motion because we 've got some speakers so it can okay you 're looking for a vote to bring it forward bring therefore yeah in line with the agenda because we may I bring up a point of order here on my agenda it says that this was presented by Mark Reeves but he 's not in and it 's written here on my agenda so I 'm claiming that the matters invalid we don 't have to deal with it because [Applause] thank you Miss Bennet meetings actually specifically envisions this the situation so any counselor can move the notice of motion explains it but I 've never heard this before and you know respectfully I 've never heard of that happening before so anyway maybe there 's some new laws that I don 't know about when you proceed thank you Miss Bennet Miss Bennet will clarify for you counsel Buckley show again miss Bennet 's just going to clarify further yes just to clarify well this situation well you may not be able to recall this situation it 's not a recent amendment to the local law in fact it 's been there at least 10 years now and I 'll just call them as I have them miss demboski madam madam mayor I think we 've certainly pardon me madam mayor I think we need to put each other 's oh sorry so we cancel retainer and it was seconded by Councillor Ellis to move it forward in the agenda so all those in favor to bring it forward thank you thank you Miss Foskey I 'll just remind you you 've got five minutes I 'm not speaking for the motion that 's quite true councillor Reeves motion is mented to fer consoles response to councillor Jackson 's mode is has been released however we just had a vote on the substantive amended motion and I do wonder if it makes the councillor Reeves motion redundant but nonetheless I will continue a sincere very mental effects statement is being prepared by kill by the proponents of the mine we already know that the EES is very likely to support the mind going here at best it may suggest some amelioration measures to hide the mines environmental impact but by definition he will not address a for his Gippsland this magic place and that 's council 's own selling point for chyre following a copper mine urban ambra whose tailings dam is already leaking into the Tambo River the mineral says mine if it goes ahead it 's very likely to be followed by other mines how the magic will survive this assault on the landscapes that make East Gippsland special needs to be explained biddy skips lands magic is contained in our forests and mountains the rivers that flowed pristine out of them the rich values their water and in the coastal lakes they nourish it 's hard to believe that our governments are prepared to sacrifice these rare natural assets for fifteen twenty to twenty years of landscape destruction through mineral extraction et Skip 's land councillors is magic because we 're different from the rest not just of this state but pretty much the whole world governors have a duty of care not just to the natural environment but to the communities that depend upon healthy soils and rivers will we be assured by the environmental effects statement that the water supply most than half a kilometer from the Mitchell River which supplies the both of our population counselors despite the New Age dictum that magic just happens we know that its elements must be carefully managed and cultivated we can 't have it both ways however an industrial landscape open to the next extractive project and the next what we properly value and state it now what makes us magic knowing that it can only become more valuable in our stressed world thank you [Applause] mr. David Eagleson thank you thanks for the opportunity to address you I 'd like to say that this motion that is proposed by counsel Ruth will be is totally invalid and can 't_''_7525.65 be dealt with tonight he actually the wordings of his he 's talking about in motion and councillor Roberts we don 't have the motion of counsel at Roberts anymore we have a resolution of the council and his motion actually says that in considering in consideration of the motion proposed by councilor Roberts hold any such action in abeyance until such time as legal advice is sought by or on behalf of motion and we don 't have a motion any more we have a resolution so his motion is totally invalid and can 't_''_7566.27 be divided I can speak with some authority on this type of thing I 've been a counselor twice once here one term here and another in another Shire and I have closely started local law for many years now the proposal by councillor Reeves to have counsel sleet legal advice before responding to community requests with stand against the motion the proposed stand mine is both unnecessary and mischievious this would be another example of wasteful legal involvement that would need to be paid for by these Gippsland ratepayers councillors our responsibility to reflect the wishes of its community and it continually makes decisions without legal advice it would appear that as a legal that it would appear that as legal advice is unnecessary that the motivation must be to delay counsel taking a public position on the proposed mine in doing this it would be advocating its responsibility to be a conduit for this community today there been inadequate liaison from community on the government only the sent fence sitting on the mind issue but determined to ignore the serious concerns of the community councillor Roberts motion would not interfere with the years process and in fact if the council were able to have properly input it would need to have properly arrived at the decision which it has by now it has now and I 'd like to also support speak in support of the presentation made by mrs. Wagner earlier on behalf of George near far to a very experienced barrister and solicitor he meant made it quite clearly that he quite clearly stated that no legal advice and he 'd be sought and I 100% agree with his sentiments thank you councillor roberts thank you madam an miss Bennett could you please verify mr. eagleson statement regarding the wording of councillor Reeves motion yeah so the councillor yves 's motion refers to my motion which is now a resolution of council so it invalidates well suggest madam mere that to be completely fair and open that we adjourn the meeting for a couple of minutes to allow miss Bennett the opportunity to with an answer to councillor Robertson 's question and if you can 't get that information this evening well then we have to accept that but perhaps she may have that ability and that might then answer whether we continued this particular debate or we don 't well maybe we only way we 'll find out is for Miss Bennet to be given the opportunity to make inquiries council white but madam mayor just asked a question you 're saying there 's still more speakers yes well Miss Bennet said she needs a couple of minutes if there 's several more speakers that 's at least 10 to 15 minutes if would you be able to do that while there 's more speakers would you be able to research while the speaker 's still carry on thanks miss Bennett we 'll carry on with the speakers but again there 's no promises that we may be able to find this out this evening so we 'll carry on with the speakers miss Mindy Yuri did she leave hey Mindy 's gone miss Joann aceman [Applause] hi once again I 'm which will farm for a number of years first off before speaking to the motion I have a concern regarding counsels ability to overturn at the request of three counselors the motion that 's been voted on tonight which happened earlier with when they change the timing of the previous motion counselor Roberts had done I understand there 's a thing with three counselors can overturn a motion within 48 hours rescind whatever it is I would be very very concerned if that happened after which is your right to do but if that happened after the public zones were shown such strong support for the motion that 's something I think we 'll be all looking out for them being very wary on thank you I said I 've been looking into this mind for a number of years I think counselor raises motion is quite mischievous several several parts that are actually factually incorrect and I can 't understand why he 's put it forward to claim at the ears process is the only process in place slides in the face of reality when we know that there the development of that project and yet the minister allowed it to go ahead so you can 't argue one thing when you 're flying in the face of what 's happened previously the council strongly supported Bastion point the e has said that it wasn 't in favor of it and yet the minister allowed it to go ahead the EIS is certainly not a nun flawed process there 's been problems with it all the way through one of the biggest issues is that the proponent decides what their plan of study is going to be and that it can hide things from the public they can certainly hide things from the government about they want to put forward and it 's only been through a lot of pressure put on them by locals by 72 submissions at hiss coping with ramen that there 's a reasonably sensitive plan of study they did not look that forward they thought that they hardly had to do studies into anything it 's only recently that they 've been required to do some studies into the vegetable industry we 've had were convinced that they should speak to the consultant about all their concerns and told that I would get the report from that consultant when caliber after that put it to caliber the farmers trusted the consultant opened up about their concerns and we 're told afterwards that they weren 't going to be given that report that we 're going to be given a sanitized fact sheet or something down the track now there 's been no reason for our community to have any trust in the process every time we turn around we 're seeing things that have item is missing like I mentioned the noise report before where they 're just talking about trucks going along the road and they 're trying to say that the noise in Londono is actually louder than Bobby Davidson 's place which is right next to the mine is one of the quietest places you can find to explain that they said well we do different averaging for the noise inland and I was opposed to Bobby 's place there is nothing straightforward about it in terms of the survey matter four loss of toxic materials in there we also know when Calvera turning around and saying that there 's nothing to see here nothing to worry about all the levels are quite fine they 're actually not using the correct standards they 're using residential soil standards which will be fine if they 're doing a housing development they are not they are digging up land and they are going to be spreading it borne matter over our community they have not looked at the proper air quality standards or the US EPA ones they were relying on people who are sitting in on the ears process not understanding all the technical problems are so see with it every one of the people and the technical reference group goes in with the best intentions but they they don 't know what they don 't know a community has done masses of investigation into this stuff we not what we 're on about that 's where we were started doing baseline studies so but we shouldn 't have to be doing this by ourselves this is costing us a fortune the this the proponent is being supported all the way through hundreds of thousands of dollars putting into them we 're going to spend countless hours of hours trying to find out what 's going on with this process we shouldn 't be asked to do it we should be getting support from Council to village we don 't know what 's in those sores apart from what 's in Calibre 's public documents and that 's what we 're based our stuff on with our every metals expert thanks maecy spin I 'll have to ask you to finish there thank you [Applause] miss Debbie Carruthers thank you we know about the substantial flaws with the EES process so we can rightly be angered and concerned when we 're told to wait and have trust in that process I emailed a copy of the Auditor General 's report on the EES to councilor pelts over a month ago and she kindly took the initiative to email this to the other councillors so you should be familiar with those flaws the reality is that is most unlikely as we 've heard ahead even though there are significant environmental problems due to the hazardous and highly toxic nature of the substances involved as well as the inappropriate location for this mine very importantly we 've heard again the Minister for planning can totally ignore what the EES says and gives you give his approval for the mind to proceed regardless according to the Auditor General only two to three projects in Victoria each year are subject to an EAS process so this reinforces the highly environmentally sensitive nature of this mine his report says and I quote the ESS assessment aims to find ways to reduce negative impacts and to shake projects to suit the local environment well I ask you that defies belief this could be achieved with this project the fact that this mine is being considered at all this location really beggars belief the parliamentary inquiry found yes process not to be meeting its objectives and stated these problems the non-binding nature of the Minister for playings recommendations and conditions imposed to the EES barriers to public participation it 's not a transparent process the need for more robust not be known about the technical reference group the TRG that oversights the EES process all the consultants who submit reports on a range of studies are sourced and financed by Cal Bar no independent studies are presented to the TRG there is no local community representative who knows the area there is a council staff member the es is due to be submitted to the minister in February no final conclusions have been provided to the community about any of the studies the community still doesn 't know as joanne said what 's the analysis of the or body including the toxins the transport route for the ATB double trucks that will be traveling on our rural roads daily the source of the three to four gigalitres or more of water the mountain will require annually neither the air quality nor the horticultural study reports have been released yet and February is just around the corner and the list goes on so what 's councillor Reeve states in his motion the public had the opportunity to comment on the draft scoping requirements but what he failed to mention most scoping document Calabar announced what it referred to as its refinements which were in fact major changes to the project which saw to name a few the size of the mining project increasing from fourteen hundred and forty to sixteen hundred and seventy five hectares a second mining unit plant being added to further refine the heavy mineral concentrate on site major roads realigned so that the historically significant fingerboards that we 've heard about tonight from the Aboriginal community won 't exist other roads are to be closed and new roads created through people 's properties without any consultation and a wet processing plant has been relocate relocated closer to homes the community requested these changes be included in the draft scoping documents and that we were given an opportunity of reply however the Minister for planning stated the public would have to wait until the EES document was finished and available for public submissions during that 30-day response period to be able to question those refinements made by calibre if the council doesn 't take a position to oppose the line now and ignore this counter motion by the ministerial decision-makers know our views could be lost and we 'll just be told that the mod will be going ahead a number of you including councillor Reeves for councillors that the unanimous decision was made to ban fracking at the show no one suggested that a legal opinion was needed to take action at that time how can you ask the community to wait for the EES process to finish when you know all these problems exist and the likely outcomes so let 's hope the council doesn 't find itself in the same situation as the city apportion with unexpected liabilities that have been talked about tonight and that a rate pair of money doesn 't have to be spent on resolving legal battles with the mineral sands mining company over what now has become a toxic waste dump left behind by Luca or when people stop buying because of real or perceived fear of contamination Thank You mr. Carruthers to visit our legs many what jobs will be lost then thank you [Applause] maryanne you 've got some advice I would preface my advice by saying define being ideal to have more time however I have been fortunate enough to be able to contact a senior counsel at counsels legal services provider who has confirmed my interpretation which is that the notice is valid and therefore can be considered and debated and I 'm having to explain the rationale for that if required yes yes please as I understand it there were two points at issue one of which is was turned on whether or not this is the motion proposed by councillor Roberts so the amendment is that the motion proposed by counsel Roberts the answer is yes even though it was amended it is still the motion has proposed by counsel Roberts and the second part of the equation was whether motion is the same as resolution so in the context that hold any such motion in abeyance my my view on that is that in all matters legal context is king and it has been confirmed by the senior counsel I spoke to that the intent of the motion is clear and that the words while not interchangeable are similar enough that the carry on with the speakers miss Louise crisp thank you madam mayor and councillors and everyone else a lots been talked about the EES process tonight and that is why I wanted to address my comments to cancel a Reeves motion I think the the clearest thing is what is the point of waiting for the EES and there 's been number of speakers already mentioned the drawbacks but what I 'd like to talk about is actually experience of one four years ago the Stockman Meyer at penumbra there is no mining without severe environmental consequences and we may as well you know be dead if we think any different and what happens is long term detrimental social and economic impacts that impact will be felt by Tampa Valley residents forever and potentially the Gibson lakes as well the original benamber copper copper and zinc mine on the headwaters of the Tambo River operated between 92 and 96 it underwent an des however the tailings dam which was constructed at the site was not at the site identified in the original EES that tailings dam is constructed across the literally a 20 meter high earthen dam across a river way on Springs so how about house that for planning significant changes can occur between the EES approval and the project delivery and as people have mentioned already the work plan changes without any community consultation at all when Dan Hearst went into receivership the company that was running the benamber of mine they walked away from the site and left a disastrous intergenerational environmental legacy a tailings dam containing 700,000 tons of highly acidic heavy-metal toxic tailings leaking into straight Creek and the downstream environment that time was at risk of breaching because it was constructed with her without a spillway despite the yes thus between 1999 and two or five the EPA had authorized emergency discharges from the tailings dam of 300 mega litres of contaminated water in two straight creeks in the Tambo when dpi undertook rehabilitation of the dam and the mine site at a cost of 7 million dollars to the taxpayer the epa authorized emergency discharges with limits for zinc at 20 times higher than the anzac freshwater limits yet this was acceded to a number of times with zinc levels almost 800 times higher than the objective this is what you get with an e yes and with an epa over sighting it where are the regulatory authorities that dam is still leaking at approximately eighty six thousand litres of contaminated water a day that is in the stockmen 2 o 14 years water samples collected from below the dam wall at a site visit and ferry to 18 assessed independently by enviro lab in melbourne were found to have zinc levels 12 to 21 times higher than Anzac freshwater guidelines and copper at 9 to 50 times higher there has never by any other government authorities been an assessment of the net flux or the cumulative impact of all this heavy metal contamination on the Tambo River and the downstream environment and Swift Creek town takes its water supply off more with less than 30 kilometers downstream and then of course it flows into the Gippsland lakes the truth so then we had another EES in to O 14 by independence group to expand that tailings dam at exactly the same size it was rehabilitated in 206 that the proposal is to raise that damn wall 45 metres above the valley it will be built on the old tailings dam which secures the containment of that toxic tailings with a plastic geomembrane liner a liner with a average Spanish potentially only 30 years and a concrete grout curtain in a highly acidic environment that will d-struct within two years if you 're lucky 80 this is what we 're building that major diamond and that got an Aes approval in over 14 not only that when the dam was rehabilitated in 206 I had a good source of person who was involved in actually the rehab project there was a repository formed in the dam wall that contains potentially acid-forming work and mine waste that was buried in a specially constructed repository that should have been taken off-site and yet the regulatory authorities allowed that to go ahead thank you Miss CRISPR that 's what you get thinking he is [Applause] mr. Victor Hugo it 's got on here that you wanted to speak to me okay thank you lastly was George Ihram I would just be repeating what I don 't really read out so I think that I 'll just kind of highlight a couple of things yeah is that the real issue and focus here is counsel can have a political view on the subject line and whether it should ecolo exercise it the motion I won 't leave that one out we are lucky to have a diverse council with considerable experience and local knowledge who are capable of deciding whether a project is appropriate given competing existing uses of land the primary issue with this mining project is there is a long-term extremely viable use of this land and one use cannot live next to the other use and no environmental management considerations can consider this I consider council should have been expressing its opinion from the staff and even sought the responsible ministers intervention to overturn the project in this dominant agricultural area I reiterate it is within councils purview to take a position on the mine without requiring legal advice as with all decisions by councillors not everyone may agree or liked the outcome but a course for the overriding benefit of everyone from the ratepayers in the Shire as your charter defines a refusal of this notice of Naumann of motion does not bar you from participation in all the steps open in the environmental effects statement process or in any points listed in councillor roofs rationale I think time is about nothing so item to point to notice of motion number four 2018 council Robert 's notice of motion be held in abeyance until legal advice is sought is there a mover No okay the motion laughs yep thank you [Applause] okay item 1.8 is a record of assemblies of counselors who madami do you want me to spend standing orders so the people wouldn 't leave from the gallery we 'll have a five-minute break we 've been going for two and a half hours and if they want to leave and not stand for the rest of the meeting right sure thanks counselor pouts backing that 35 counselors can I get a vote please all those in favor of benning 's down standing orders council retainer all those in favor made for the standing orders adjust adjourn the meeting for five minutes just that 's just to help you they 're not [Music] _"

CEO met Amir I 'm at my pass this over to miss Bennett I am unaware of but the other thing I 'd like to add is both counsels and staff I remind you and the act is very clear that the onus is on individuals to make any declaration no have another question sir as that population is with the beautification and reduction of available parking spaces around the next Street Mall and library area what provisions are being planned to ensure the safety of our most vulnerable members of our community like the disabled printed prams unless mobile seniors keeping in mind that at the meeting at melakarta it will suggest it but a 30-minute parking limit in this area would be sufficient time to get shop thanks mr. shields miss Nelson thank you yes it 's a very good question and something issues with provision of car parking spaces the work that we do in improving the streetscape is something that does concern a lot of people but the work that we 're doing in Nicholson Street at the moment is just one of a number of initiatives that we 've been working on over a number of years and there will be more over time where our aim is actually to improve the way that parking turnover and supporting the activities the commercial activities in VN star and in fact over the time that we 've been doing working it 's further work that will work that we 're doing in Nicholson Street is actually about making the whole environment much more people for pedestrians mums with prams roly 's at the moment streetscape very difficult doesn 't opportunities and there 's I guess we need to see the Nicholson Street project in the context while you 're looking at that what does the council think to the idea that it 's in place in some areas of Melbourne where seniors apply for a sticker like and what the color displays and stickers yesterday to put on their wind screens to allow them to park in the senior and the parking spaces and I could be available curbside in nipples on the street the same sort of thing for parents um I 'm not process the exports I 'm not entirely sure how that would work it may be that that 's something that private car parts but I am aware that the the disabled done parking permit process allows for people to seek parking permit which is the green pea actually allows people under six permission yeah with permission from their medical practitioner processes it 's very common that people Thank You mr. shields miss Karina Turner [Applause] the Local Government Act states that the objectives of the council are one the primary objective of council is to endeavor to achieve the best outcomes for the local community having regard to the long term and cumulative effects of decisions and to in seeking to achieve its primary objective a council must have regard to the following facilitating objectives to promote the social economic environmental viability and sustainability of the really support district and to ensure the resources are used efficiently and effectively and services are provided in accordance with the best value principles to best meet the needs of the community local community what does the council say the top three priorities and opportunities to be incorporated into the review of the next environmental sustainability strategy how will it be resourced ie how many staff effective full-time and what is the process for allocating an operational and capital budget to its implementations and what does council says the top three threats to our local environment thanks mister no mr. Bennet oh sorry I mean revised document in answering the question I 'm really answering environmental sustainability czar really particularly so both the current and the future strategy we 'll make sure that it focuses on ask the aspects of our environment and sustainability that councils has responsibility for can regulate in the review so far the focus that we 've identified the first money is minimized so from a planning perspective we have a lot of ability to the places with people so it 's a lot about acknowledging that we influence the urban environment there the two areas of focus that gives you some indication I guess in terms of our allocation of resources sustainability and we operate on four we driven from that area and Council has invested quite heavily particular energy issues and has been quite successful in attracting how we allocate those resources through the annual budget process and be subject to what the new revised strategy says already but the revised strategy will be made public the field do you know I can 't say it will be this year and question 2 is during the March council meeting escape Sencha our recycling does not go to landfill further in a letter dated the 28th of March regarding the fate of our recycling Weigel it assured me that our recycling does not end up in landfill but is sorted in Benz dal and further sorted in Melbourne by busy before being exported overseas as you 're aware China announced in July 2007 that they would ceased taking recycling recyclable materials which came into effect in January 2018 indi India followed suit last week upholding the principles this is the Indian government upholding the principles of sustainable development and ensuring minimal impact on the environment this leaves a smaller market for us recycling waste to be shipped to other Asian countries currently accepting waste such as Vietnam Thailand and Malaysia these countries already have poor infrastructure to deal with their own waste let alone that from developed nations and according to Cheryl cats of Yale University the world needs to sharply cut down on single-use plastic in December 2017 the land waste educator Michelle Kearns wrote a single for a single use of plastic free policy which was on the pressing agenda items it was then rescheduled for February February 2018 just after the China banned it was then it was again removed from the agenda and it is since not been rescheduled what does the East Gippsland Shire have what plan does he skips on SH I have to reduce the amount of plastic produced either by individuals or businesses thanks mister no mr. Bennett thank you this is not my area but I 've spoken to the manager does look after that particular area I would like to add though that in regard to what we 're looking at as far as recycling projects and so on we our waste department manager has just made contact with myself in regard to possibility of recycling last because waste stream contains about 65 percent glass and there has been trials done in other city regions where they 've operated glass into quite successfully so we 're now looking at doing the same thing it 's referred to as a boutique methodology of recycling and obviously you know it 's much more cost-effective down in a city environment where all the thing then in this region is obviously going to cost more money but we can always specify in our contract the reuse of recycled materials in those particular contracts obviously that 's going to come at a cost as well so we 're looking at it you know we 're balancing up the costs versus the benefits and that sort of thing and that 'll be an ongoing process and my question was actually what 's the council doing to reduce the amount of waste produced both by individuals and businesses thank you thank you mr Turner 1.8 is report of assemblies of councils for February and March 2019 thanks counselor pouts councillor Reeves thank you all those in favor it 's carried unanimously 1.9 petitions off-leash dog part Everett Park and we have because for this Miss Maggie Sucre would you please come to the microphone and do you have five minutes thank you for the opportunity speaker last year after council put an online vote for preferences for two proposed sites for an off-leash dog parking Lakes Entrance which obtained 120 votes for the most preferred I applied consideration of what several local drove owners and myself considered a far superior sighted ever park the dog park at that meeting there were four councillors and their present councillors Peltz and Murray both spoke positively about my proposal 20 minutes later Council to approve their own proposal and I was left wondering what was happening I didn 't however rest on the alternate proposal and draw up petition forms a place that various businesses around town I didn 't get out as many as I wish you two having an ill husband and when I collected them three places across them however despite all that I received 240 votes in favor double him and the council had received two their petition as well I placed two posts on local social media and received over 100 threats in that in favor with three suggesting and even other places and only two negative reactions one being from a person who backs onto a fat park and one who obviously hated dogs anyway I send every council of the results of my petition and copies of all the signatures to the mayor in despite receiving an email saying that I would be contacted it appears that maybe ratepayers opinions are not respected councillor dick Ellis email me several times several times I 'm on February 28th the adviser said he requested the CEO Anthony Basford to halt work on the Palmers Road site until my petition was dealt with in a council meeting I heard to know more after that but was informed on Wednesday 27th of March by another supportive resident that working again started on the Palmas Road site but the fence being erected I didn 't know whether the issue had been dealt with I feel the answers probably know I 've been received a letter inviting me to speak again at this meeting my main concern is that the 67,000 allocate dollars at allocation to this area that is a boggy spot there 's no shame whatsoever and despite any planting now there will not be any shade for a long time the watercourse along side the end fence harbored snakes in fact a warning sign was put up there a short time ago to this effect and of tourists to Lakes Entrance who wish to walk their dogs somewhere closer rather than I 'm hitching their caravans as well as the many elderly residents of our town they can be up to 26 dogs at any bad dog illegal little dog meets ranging from the small four kilogram dog to a forty five kilogram puppy and they all get along famously a few regulars went there recently on an extremely hot day we said on our chairs under the trees and the daughters didn 't venture far or wear themselves out but they still enjoyed this the socialization I know the drizzly day we 're able to go there again as the tree is provided and up short from the right rain so all these things are available there but they certainly wouldn 't be in the other spot we 've not had any worries with snakes from the wharf of course that runs along the park as the area their plain is far enough away for it not to be a problem I realized the perilous road so it is obviously a definite go and now approval but paragrah is a second dog off leash area and do nothing more than make it legal and supply rubbish bin and some signage ideally if a specific area could be fenced off around the tree in walkers joggers bike riders and others walking dogs on leads would not possibly possibly annoyed by a few inquisitive friendly dogs when they going to the park this is the only potential problem that I have observed that bothers me although there 's never been an incident each time we meet the dogs know which dogs are arriving in which car and come to greet them when they arrive likewise some of them also go to greet anyone new walking through alternatively alternatively a fence along the walking path would work so I 'd like counsel the further consider this is the second additional central sight for those who love to socialize their dogs thank you thank you miss Sakura one point nine point one petition off-leash dog park evert park mr. hollow thank you madam mayor madam mayor as you 've just recently heard we 've received a petition regarding ever the head petitioner provide her considerations of that matter counselors you 'll be aware that there was two sites that were considered for the dog off leash parks in Lakes Entrance being 43 karmas Road and 55 Palmer 's road Lakes Entrance councils can recall that there was consultation done in regards to those particular locations and was determined by the vast majority 43 Palmer 's Road was the better place counselors this site was chosen because there were to any active user groups at the site at the time wherever Park is currently utilized by the CFA and the lakes entrance mention counselors indeed we have to be very careful as not to impinge upon everybody 's ability to use public open space and to enjoy it for what it 's worth councils furthermore you 'll be aware that we are exploring and proposal to declare the whole of the shy dog off leg except for certain areas and this stage a reference group has been established the reference group it 's hope will assist council officers to determine whether the pros worthy of further can see and what reference group and the proposals only are this infancy stages of it suggest that we we await for that process to finalize as such there 's a recommendation in front of councils that effectively notes that we three partners Road Lakes Entrance is the area to add this being declared as dog off leash their work has commenced at that site and that we do not have cede to the petitioners request notice that the process is underway for the proposal to declare the whole of the show dog off leash and notice the council officers will advise the lead petitioner of council 's decision and I 'm happy to take questions thank you thanks mr. hollow counselors are there any questions cats the pelts thank you madam me mr. hollow with regards to the way you said we 're entertaining the thought of having the whole of the area I think we 've been working on wondering when it 's gonna come to fruition it 's actually going to be nice can you advise this what time time period would be expected to be taking place I wouldn 't a latter part of this year at the moment we 're going through the reference group process to do to determine the parameters of where is should be dog on lead and areas that can be awfully that reference group is got a number of community participants upon that reference group coming to some findings about those matters council will be briefed about it counselors can then make a decision as to whether they wish the proposal to proceed further if we proceed further there would have to be a whole of shy wide consultation process and then obviously a final decision by councilors so I would be suggesting to yourself counselor there would be in the latter part of this year that we get through that potential string of decision-making counselor Ellis thanks mr. Holloway as you know I 've been chasing this issue up on behalf mr. secure and other residents of Lakes Entrance for some time three weeks ago I at a council briefing I asked whether or not they 'd been any further information come forward and relation to a secondary dog off leash park which sector from the regional partners group I 'm wondering if you have since that time and last week 's gained any further information as to what is occurring with that grant and has there been any development with any alternative parking likes entrance thanks for your question counselor Ellis on in Friday 's Friday last week I did provide councilors through a separate communication information regarding progress towards the establishment of that private dog park the advice that we 've received and and I guess the state government isn 't at liberty to provide us with extensive information around the status of a grant that they 've provided to a private group of people but from what I can understand they have received the first part of the grant there are a number of milestones they must meet before receiving further funding and they they do also need to provide evidence that they have planning approval for such a part to proceed and we have not at this stage seen any application for planning permits or otherwise in respect of that proposed privately operated any further questions counselors know there thanks counselor retain a counselor to a second are there any speakers any speakers would like counsel to acknowledge the good work of a security group and bringing forward a public well-being issue towards towards us I acknowledge the work and upon the point of view in relation to Everett Park the point is of course the David Park is a central place in Lakes Entrance and that 's southern side of the drain is not a very heavily used piece of land I 'm pleased to see that the area is being used at the YAC we don 't cite for the let 's say short term until we can get this what was shy wide proposal up and running and I encourage officers to work hard to get that done sooner than later thank you can you fit any further speakers I 'll put the motion cancer poets if I may you know this issue I 'm finding incredibly frustration frustrating as I believe the community probably is too when we first came on to council probably in our second term it was something that we felt was and we did request that they would find one in all of our townships and at this stage we have managed to only find two one in lakes entrance and one in bends down and it 's not through the lack of trying I think there 's quite a lot of rigorous compliance that actually goes with something like this I am for a dog owner myself passionate dog owner you know I 'd like to be able to walk my dog off the lead and and I feel a lot of people in the community view their animals as part of their family and they have well-trained animals a lot of my knees please be respectful for the process that our offices are undergoing my I would wish that we would be here tonight moving a complete dog off leash area in our region because I feel that 's the way we need to be in our modern lives but I do respect there are a lot of people that are scared of it of dogs and they haven 't had the fortunate time have been able to have respect we need to be respectful of them and and stick to the rules as they are now so with that I will be supporting this motion but I would plead that the group that he 's undertaking the works on the dog off leash area that they might be able to come to some kind of arrangement by the end of the year because the community is waiting on it basically thank you thanks councillor pelts there no further speakers I 'll put the motion to all those in favor all those against motion is carried unanimously thank you mister hallo item two notices of motion or rescission mr.

events that they hold thanks counselor counselor Pelt 's just think you met him me this month has still had many regional highlights on the long weekend of course we had what we can call the Royal or Bosch show which is a really important part to the farmers in the region campaigning their goods to a level to be up to get them through to being showcased in Melbourne so it 's imperative that we keep these show country meeting the city and being able to showcase our our wares from our regional areas to the likes of Melbourne and the International also the breathing blues festival again was a great success with many people flocking to the town she been staying in the caravan park I think it was fully booked out for probably than maybe seven days around the festival the three-day festival hosted many good musicians and the event was was had the I 'll be back next year charm about it so the township came alive and did a remarkable job catering for the influx of people who attended and I 'd like to say well done to the organizers for a great calendar for that community Friday the 29th of March the mayor the executive director and myself met the members of the almost Historical Society the almost exhibitions sent our managers and volunteers the almost slab manager and the volunteers and then lastly Gary Squires who represented the old boss Chamber of Commerce discuss their regional concerns and progress within the or boss Township the visit whilst was short it was greatly advocated and played a great role in getting that Township to where it is today they 're very keen to to have their area heard and the rear dressing as that township evolves I mean when I really appreciated of appreciative of that and they 're very keen to make sure Saturday the 30th of March I was asked to for me open the pumpkin exhibition at the August exhibition center and I was delighted to see the building being used exactly for the purpose it was built for and I commend the committee I commended the committee in doing so the exhibition included works from various local artists so many of the school children had enthusiastically made works to exhibit for the exhibition this exhibition is combined with a bit of historical pumpkin growing data in the region and he 's for on for the school holidays and we 'll close at the end of Easter I think after that day which is coming up shortly and lastly on Sunday the 7th of April arm I represented the mayor at the official opening of the this girl can launch in sporting activities when I was reading out the facts I was quite confronted with the statistics that 52 percent of women are worried about being judged whilst exercising 41 percent of these people fear of embarrassment worried about being judged while exercise fear of embarrassment while so bad it stopped them from being active and one in five women do not do any physical activity in a week and women are much more likely to unlikely to be less participating in organized sports than men and their participating rates drop off as they get older and I thought that was really sad for the female so the whole concept of the day was to have a go at things they had stand-up paddleboarding they had a nice yoga class which I went home and got my gear and attended with the ladies and then they had some other exercise classes on as well so it was a really nice day there was probably not so greatly supportive but I felt probably from a lack of advertising and putting out to the right market so other than that it was spend some time Thank You Metta men at the conclusion of my report thanks counselor Phelps I 'll just touch on a couple of big events that we had today which was a visit from the Deputy PM as counselor raised a literature Minister Michael McCormick and our federal local member Diane Chester who were making a big announcement at former farms today around 10 million dollar ten million dollars allocated to on farm water water infrastructure to support our horticultural industry which is a massive investment for our region and they also then joined us at the jail Street bridge opening which connects two important industrial areas of bends Dale and as we heard it 's been a long time in the making I think around 30 years so it was great to see that finally your open and pleading to see the Deputy PM and federal member also in attendance so I 'll leave that there thank you okay item 5 is 5.1 strong communities 5.1.1 Arts and Culture progress report 2017 and 2018 mr. Kate Nelson you met a man the purpose of this report is to range of activities that have been taking place in the arts and culture sector across this land Sharon it doesn 't include a report about every single thing that 's happened over the last couple of years but certainly includes some important things including some case studies to give you an idea of the range of activities and certainly counselors tonight have talked about some of the some of the optical activity the the actions that are being taken are being guarded by recommendations that council adopted from the creative communities advisory board which was in place and they left us with a strategic action plan to progress more strategic work in arts and culture area a couple of key strategic initiatives worth mentioning which are included in the the document was the holding of a form in partnership with regional arts Victoria which brought together a wide range of community members together in all most of the exhibition center there to talk about arts and cultural activities and it was the catalyst really for the current process that we 've commenced to develop an arts and culture strategic plan cultural development networks cultural planning framework that 's something that will be presented to council and the community over the next few months and something that will help guide our strategic activity arts and culture and creative industries if you like into the future there 's no specific action required thanks miss Nelson do we have any questions when the counselors no thanks counselor Ellis thanks counselor poets speakers just very briefly the arts and culture report is indicating a way forward for our underfunded and under loved arts community as I 'm constantly reminded and kind of agree with in fact I encourage counsels to become familiar with the prose progress arts and community P section of the council are undertaking and I commend the report to you two for adoption thank you thanks counselor Ellis councilor pelts I just not to say you know it 's great to have some kind of direction some kind of guide thank you any further speakers I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion carries unanimously thanks miss Nelson five point one point two mallacoota community clubrooms project aware of the background of this item there 's been several briefings and also the in consultation meeting holding mallacoota v markzware had both objectives and supporters of the item k points with in relation to the military community owned a planning application was submitted and there were 14 objections received which obviously triggered triggered a planning consultative meeting I mean consultation meeting from the submissions it was clear their support for the development of the sporting club rooms in mallacoota and the concerns centered around the location in the scale of the project based on the concerns have sorry based on those concerns officers revised the plans in particular regarding location you 'd be aware that there 's a number of site constraints which resulted in the currently proposed location being identified as the only four hoggle location and regarding scale the proposed proposed plans were revised to reduce the size of the facility and therefore mitigating some of the impacts on grease tray as well as some of the other the other concerns these revised plans were circulated to objectors prior to the planning consultative meeting and as 't eliminate all of the objectors concerns we believe it will minimize the physical impact facility also believe will still deliver a facility that will make the community needs and importantly an additional result of those modifications that it reduces the expected cost of the development and that 's to a level where a planning permit is not only required so but we believe that it 's appropriate to second council receiving the autumn so there is a recommendation provided which is in support of proceeding with the project in the existing location with the revised plans prepared and circulated thanks mr. Richards questions councillors counselor pouts yeah I 'm not sure how this is sitting with me that you knew second paragraph here it says this project is somewhat unusual as council has the dual role of project proponent with the committee and the responsible authority under the relevant requirements of the planning and and I just would like to know the complexity about that how often this happens to us I think when we look back we could only think about one or two other scenarios where we are objections to it as well so while web we have commuted through the budget and funding applications to deliver this project it still requires council approval from a planning perspective so it is on it is a slightly unusual situation where we 're dealing with objections to a I own project so that 's that 's why the process that we 've gone through yeah we tried to be as transparent as we possibly can to give an opportunity to but still go through a proper decision-making process that everybody can so it is a unusual situation in respect to the mallacoota boat rent was that not an under similar situation no well malik well we were the proponents of the boat ramp yes absolutely completely different process though so yeah on a completely different scale to so this is really something that council can decide on rather than us seeking permission for the boat ramp the victorian government so this is a decision we can make with the boat ramp yes we were the proponent dealing with objections but we weren 't the decision any further questions councillors speakers council race well councillors we all know the site we 're up there for our last meeting and we understand and appreciate the complexities and the concerns of some of the the nearby residents and and I hope that they felt that their concerns were heard and they have been responded to we understand the complexities of that location and we really I think the officers have worked hard to try and form an intersection between meeting the needs and also maximizing the desired outcomes on that particular site had turned out to be quite a constrained site we thought we had quite a lot of flexibility there when we first started that process but it actually we ended up being literally backed into a corner I suppose by both the need to use the grant money to spend it and to get the outcomes you ordered for the community on that particular site and I hope that the community members so agree with counselors in that we think that the consultation has been extensive and sufficient and I hope that those members of the community who were who been heard and the result is a facility that will complement that particular site and also responds to their concerns as well I think it has but also I think that we also need to mention the desire to protect the cultural heritage of our Shire and to compliment the officers and the members of the community in actually undertaking that cultural heritage survey and having a better understanding of the long rich and deep cultural connection that that particular site has and being able to meet those needs of a contemporary sporting facility but also respecting those cultural heritage values is often very hard but we I think we 've achieved it so counselors on balance I believe the result is an excellent outcome I hope you support it I hope we can progress this quickly with the desired outcomes the benefit of the community thank you thanks counselor Reeves there 's a second I wish to speak thanks madam me just to also endorse the comments made by councillor Reeves it 's been a thorough process its had a high level of support and you know there are we want to undertake and I think in this instance you know we 're going to progress with with the project and sometimes you just can 't have perfection and you need progress thank you thanks counselor ratinho can slip out I just like to say our visit to mallacoota was really great and I think the officers did a fantastic job in explaining the complexities with regards to this project because there were cultural heritage issues with the first the first proposal and then there were the bushfire overlay with the with the first proposal and the second proposal is just doubt the one that we 've actually we 're actually going with is just outside the bushfire overlay issue that we have it 's going to be a really great asset for the community I believe we 'll even for the females that get changed in the cars or on the sidelines of the footy oval I think it gives them a bit of privacy being able to use the club rooms and to me I think the what we actually had in the way of complaints and gain versus a great community asset and I I do feel for the people that have that have put in their concerns about the issue with this proposal but the bottom line is it 's for the benefit to us for the whole community in the whole of the region so I actually believe it is something that 's going to be a great asset to the township and it will expand that Township probably again like probably fivefold so I commend the officers on the great work that they 've been able to achieve with this proposal thanks counselor pulse are there any further speakers that said I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you thanks mr. Richards before we move on to the next item mr. CEO did you have a comment yes thank you madam mayor my apologies for this but has just been brought to my attention that there is in fact a further conflict of interest declaration that was submitted on Thursday that I unfortunately hadn 't received but it 's been brought to my attention now on the record and he 's for council of white in item 4.1 he will declare and leave the room mr. CEO I 'm five five point four point one my apologies so just for the record five point two point six and counselor white will leave you believe therein my apologies for the late notice of that Thank You mr. CEO 5.2.1 petition off leash dog park mate on and surrounding areas and we have a request to speak from miss Louise Stoltz Thank You Marion counselors yes we have to go back to that I 'm afraid the other day I belong to the meat hunt bloodhounds it 's a it 's a charity group for the local area when I say the local area for the last thing we did it was for the CFA and the wildlife Bush shelter that was a dog show that was my idea to put on and Swan reach reserve is where it was done we didn 't get that much publicity because it is just a small group of people we had 150 people come with their dogs they came dogs with other dogs they wanted to talk to other people who also were dog lovers I sent you with the petition all the health reasons that there should be one for the dog and for the people especially now I really don 't understand I belong to this reference group I joined it and I 'm very glad I did about the off-leash because we came from paren my husband is a retired medical and it was a big sea change but one thing we were really pleased about was that we were going to be in the country and being dog lovers that was going to be great we could not believe that it felt so hostile with all the leash you know have to be on the lesion so if we just it felt people must hate dogs here and yet in the village you see 90% of the people have a dog while they 're having their cappuccino in the morning now I still don 't understand how that is relevant to a dog park because if you 're walking your dog like you do and that 's fine and if they you know they 're already social and if they 're mature but if they 're a young dog or an old person that can 't make that walk that 6 kilometer walk or whatever we do get to the village for exercise then the dog park is essential and it 's essential for this people the ratepayers for them to stay healthy and there 's I can give you so much so much stuff it but it would be more than five minutes of why that people should be allowed to socialize at a dog park this takes care of the people who don 't like dogs if you 've got a fenced-in dog park it takes me of both but if it 's just about off leash and I don 't know if that 's just to save money to put a dog park in a dog park is a fence it should be the grass needs to be cut we need trash cans we need a water fountain for the dogs and we need it to look nice with some trees that to give us all we need because if it looks nice then it will actually be an addition to a very pretty village now I 'm and it 's not just me tongue it 's no Gerner Tambo Bluff Swan reach these put the Johnsons fill these places are still too far to put your dog in a car and go to Lakes Entrance or burn style it 's just like the swimming pool my husband loves that swimming pool in lakes but I 'm not going to get in there go there watch my hair come back and drive over I 'd love to have a swimming pool in me tongue as well when you get a couple thousand people in one place and and there are pretty heavy ratepayers as well I just don 't get what 's the problem with the dog park I really don 't I can only see a win-win situation for people who don 't like dogs and people who do like dots and and a socialized dog is a social animal at unsocialized dog is not a social animal if you stick have it barked this is a dog that I would worry about a child climbing the fence or coming out of their grandmother 's backdoor but if you socialize that dog from an early age and continuing and make it part of the family because that 's that 's the way they were bred dogs so gregarious they want to be part of the family that would be safer as well thank you thanks miss totes mr. hollow thank you madam ear similar to some of the reasoning of the previous petition that a decision was made upon I do wish to just confirm that we have bodies petitioners on the reference group and their assistance in assisting us and the whole reference group is much appreciated councillors similar to the past petition we have a process in place that process is about determining the parameters of where dog should be on lead and where dog should be off lead it doesn 't necessarily suggest that counsel would not turn its mind into the future about the creation of dog parks that would be subject to the usual representations from making sure that we can get the legislation clear any skips in its making sure that different people who exercise their animals in different ways can do so appropriately and we to our council recognize the health benefits and the health benefits not just to the dogs but to people from the ability to take their their animals off leash and exercise them on that basis councillors there 's a recommendation similar to the previous recommendation that notes the process that is currently under way determines not to accede to the petitioners request and notes the council 's will advise a repetition of council 's decision Thank You mr. Holloway mr. Holden did you have something further and you know on a very rare occasion where my colleague hasn 't you know we 're provided all of the fact so I just would elaborate one thing that to create fenced dog park anywhere would require a declaration for their area to be under current circumstances to be declared dog off leash so in declaring a dog off leash area for every dog park that would need to be established that every every one of those occasions in determining the areas where we 're going to determine you know dog off leash we get all of them in one kit thereby paving the way for future establishment of fenced areas where they are appropriate and and serve the community best thanks mr. Holton questions counselors counselor Ellis number two spring to mind in the first first one I 'll do it how much work is really involved in making these declarations for a dog off leash area so councillor there 's a requirement one of the difficulties about declaring a dog off leash area so to declare in order to to have an order to declare an area dog or flea is that we firstly have to consider whether council would wish to establish a dog park area and that 's to take consultation of a wider community it 's appropriate to take consultation of the wider community because some people don 't necessarily have the view that areas should be utilized for that purpose and some people have different views about dogs not being on a leash so that does to go through the official process of actually declaring and having a report come before council and of course then there 's the establishment of the actual facility so overall it can take some time upwards sometimes up to six months so there was is there any difficult in Council for meeting a temporary dog off leash area whilst processes are undertaken a to identify perhaps a better site or alternatively to establish an actual site taking into account the concerns that have been raised by councilors earlier in terms of the time it 's taking us to achieve our shop wide dog off leash process and now I just like to deal with in two parts in terms of the timing I note that the memorandum suggesting that we undertake this process in respect of declaring these Shire a dog off leash area was brought to council 's attention on the 28th of June last year 2018 since then we 've declared two dogs off leash areas one in lakes entrance and one in beam-style and progressed the process of declaring the entire Shire a dog off leash area once already and is moving down the path towards another two meetings so in terms of your question the timeliness officers have acted quite swiftly on this matter because we acknowledge the concerns of the community and and the benefits of having companion animals and having those animals socialize in terms of the legality of temporarily declaring a an area to be dog off leash I I don 't believe that that was a way to go through and still would require a significant community consultation because other other users may use that and have some and quite right they have some objections and fears around that and it still would require a declaration of council to actually declare an area dog off leash because the entire municipality is declared dog on leash we 've got ourselves into that sort of situation that 's why we want to proceed with a more more broad brush to achieve a much more expedient outcome when these matters come up in the future one final question because I 'm having difficulty of this I 'm thinking of the recommendation for the broad lands reserve lands that are set aside at the south side the southern end of the broad lamp broad lands road there which has no neighbor with no neighbors would the requires that you have alluded to be necessarily needed to so consultation etc would that actually be needed on a recreational area owned by counsel in short yes it 's a it 's declared it as it is part of councils public the public open space the public domain it is currently declared as a dog on leash area and would have to be declared as a dog off leash area for it to be used in that in that manner regardless of whether an areas of dog on leash area or a whether a dog is an off-leash area is it where they 're in area is the dog off leash here owners of dogs are still required to have the dogs under their effective control but but that area like other public open space within the municipality currently is declared as a dog on leash area and there are two exceptions to that one is former Bannister landfill Road baked entrance thanks counselor Ellis any further questions counselors no okay there 's a motion before you do I have a mover thanks counselor Roberts thanks counselor to e second English speakers okay all those in favor those against okay so motion carry motion carries seven one with one abstain against and cancelled substan syllabic we I 'd like a clarification of this abstinent it 's I 've been told previously it equals a no vote well that being the case what 's the point why was it included in the revised Act it would mean that Miss Benton anyway comments which are one but I think the pointing that stain whatever reason that they do not wish to cast a vote and read into that whatever I choose but effectively you correct it does work as [Laughter] five point two point two planning permit application 296 slash 2018 slash P application for a two lot subdivision 170 Race Course Road bans Dale and we have a request to speak for a mr. Richard Hawks Lee and you have five minutes thank you madam mayor councillors we 've had evening I represent the firm that has made this application on behalf of the landowner seeking approval for subdivision of the land of 170 Race Course Road being South to be subdivided into two Lots the property 's a little bit over seven hectares in area and we 're seeking to create one lot one vacant lot approximately 1.1 and change hectares remote with a residual balance of a little over six hectares that will contain then an established dwelling there 's a number of concerns we know that have been raised in the officers report that culminate in a recommendation for refusal we 're somewhat disappointed by this but nonetheless we appreciate the opportunity to put our case before you this evening there 's a number of things that are summarized and otherwise picked up in the report which I believe I 'd like to highlight to you I guess in favor of the proposal as distinct from being against it by the bother report first thing it makes mention of is that the properties contained under the penstock growth strategy is a no residential development area well the years old it 's yet to be reviewed it 's probably in most planning strategic requirements these days about you to be reviewed to make sure it remains relevant to the planning of our town and what that timer was considered to be a residential development area thereby considering in the context of the other comments in the report preserving it for or maintaining it as a farming area the same strategy identifies it as possible area for industrial growth so on the peers of this report is trying to have almost to Babic what if you like it can 't develop it for residential but it and wants to because it goes against the agricultural policies and the farming zone within the planning scheme and yet it could be a good idea for industrial land we find that somewhat hard to hard to stomach and accept particularly when that strategy didn 't go in any way into any depth in determining on what basis it would support or could support or was otherwise appropriate for industrial growth it has very very limited explanation within the bean style growth strategy the event that if Council are looking for more industrial land let 's find an appropriate location not one that segmented by waterways ephemeral waterways that ultimately led into the moral McLeod Creek it 's a somewhat environmentally sensitive area that might I 'd say not not really conducive to industrial land a point in terms of in the comments made about perhaps restricting future greater Fitness the area for alternative uses using the fact that the proposed lot would lead to essentially the construction of a dwelling which could be impacted by alternative uses or otherwise restrict those other alternative uses from occurring well when you look at this on the ground and I 'm sure you 've seen the plans in the report the accompanying photographs and so forth the vacant lot is literally sandwiched between two existing dwellings so the West is a lot of a similar size and scale it 's an established residential property at a little over one actia to the eastern side the existing dwelling resting on 6 hectares would be retained is further residential dwellings to the South Jackson to Forge Creek is serving we put it to you as ultimately a rural residential precinct that the farming zone really isn 't a true reflection of either the lands capacity for agricultural production or indeed its current land use you 've got hobby farms and even less with resident rural residential properties you 've got rural land as a rural leading zoned land immediately to the north on Race Course Road opposite this precinct and opposite this property as well as the racecourse it 's fully serviced with reticulated water and electricity the other component to the reports the data set we 've got 30 seconds ample resident rulers an intra land to the north well this property is serviced unlike a lot of that land supply and much closer to the community infrastructure and other services within the town it really is an application that represents in our opinion what this precinct is used for and that in the absence of with the upcoming rather review of the or implementation of further review of the rural land use strategy we welcome the opportunity for rural residential land supply to be considered with this proposal tonight at the very least if not otherwise supportive of it we would ask that any decision be deferred until the end of June when we believe the current review of the rural land use strategy to implement the to also consider rural living his own slant supply is also included and considered thank you thanks mr. Hawksley mr. Hawley thank you madam mayor councillors just in in very quick summary I 'd like to go through this application and I am going to keep it quite brief counselors this land is clearly identified as a no residential development area the best our growth strategy the proposal you 've approved may lead to a new landowner believing that they have a reasonable opportunity development Healy pria to develop the newly created what with a dwelling the growth strategy identifies as a future growth for future growth front should be protected from further subdivision to ensure that future rezoning a redevelopment can effectively take place which can prove difficulty with growth front involves many landowners counselors not determined what this growth front may be utilized for and the developed by dwelling could introduce a sensitive use that may restrict counselors ability to consider a range of planning options counselors I understand from the presentation put forward tonight that the applicant is suggesting that this area is already rural residential this area is strategically important to the town of Bern style it represents a growth front it represents the opportunity for counselors at that time to consider what this growth front should be should it be rural living should it be industrial and it wouldn 't be something that would be identified within necessarily band style growth strategy at that time they would have been saying at that time and when it 's strategically important for East Gippsland Shire Council to consider this growth front let 's provide some options here for the council determine what 's the appropriate zone counselors you 're aware that there are concerns about subdivisions within the farming so this proposal in no way represents a bit agricultural outcome there would be appear to be no immediate or medium-term planning needed to need for the subdivision and councillors although allowing the application to come the farming zone to create a small vacant lot and a larger lot containing the dwellings seems to be at the ear prods with the reasons why this provision was placed into the planning scheme the application is submitted does not demonstrate the use of this provision will result in a better area cultural outcome councillors for very good reason tonight council officers have considered this application in detail and believe it is not worthy for the grant of a permit and therefore to issue a notice the decision to refuse the application thank you thanks mr. Howe a question is councils council while thank you madam mayor but just like to ask a question regarding all the previous developments in that area as to if it 's a farming zone was it that we have many very small allotments along base course Road we have more on on we had more on voyage Creek Road approaching Humphreys line with more down Humphreys line and then we have a large group of small allotments along sinigang Newell Road so where was the strategy when all these properties were was subdivided lot development and the subdivision pants and the Shire a historical in nature and indeed that 's one of the reasons why as the applicant suggested we are going to be reviewing the rural strategy and we 're certainly having that peer reviewed at this stage we 're wishing to have the question which we think there could be potentially gap by about answered for rural living zoned areas and obviously land supply and areas that should be or should not be lending themselves towards rural living and there were decisions made at a time at a different planning horizon and you do get some historic historical and legacy developments that if we all had our 20 vision on we would be saying that we shouldn 't have gone ahead with it at the time council what in regards to the through the thoughts of auto rezoning or looking into it what would be a time frame with regards to that because whether this could be held hold off until there was a reasonable time frame held off until you your strategy counselors this to two pieces of work in the rural land use strategy and depending on what the peer review might entail would mean then refinement of that strategy once council considered that refinement and if they were in favor of it the strategy would be adopted then there would be most likely at least a two-year process to implement all the reasonings that would be associated with that strategy if we look at the beam-style growth strategy that would need a review of the growth strategy and then obviously a planning scheme amendment to bring on a rezoning of whatever that would be at that growth front which again we 'd have another couple of years counselor Ellis that 's a question for mr. hollow again I just want to clarify and the point that mr. Hawksley mentioned and that was that there was a review to be released in the end of June in relation to planning matters and I 'd venture to see here is that factual I 'm not questioning mr. Hawks issues but I 'm just means they 're factual and what he 's reporting is that that that review will could impact deferring that a decision this evening would that impact in any negative or positive way upon any the outcome I 'll take that one no counselor Ellis what we 're what we 're actually doing is doing a peer review of a previous document that came in two before counselors for their consideration which was the rural land use strategy which came in here in 2016 given that there are pressures on these growth runs and there are a variety of missed opportunities within our rural land areas as the strategic planning team identified this we determined that it would be good to have another look at that rural land use strategy we note also that the rural Andrew strategy didn 't pick up on the rural living zone and the been style growth strategy doesn 't pick up on the rural living zone because it 's it 's essentially it 's a rural zone not a residential zone as such so whilst people live there its primary primary function is rural rural and and with people living there so we thought it was prudent to have that piece of living zoned areas now what 's being proposed in this application is essentially a rural living outcome but in a farming zone and and I think Aaron has quite articulated quite well that it it seems that in in proceeding with an application permit by permit both to permit you ultimately determined those are what the zone is rather than having a strategy to do that so in terms of how this impacts on future decision on this there is some there would there may be an indication that this may be land that could be useful for rural living or it may be identified as a as a different sort of zone and there are there are other zones besides farming rural living to be considered here one of which I can think of the top of my head which the rural activity zone so there 's an of different considerations there and in terms of kicking the can down the road so to speak it I 'm not sure that there 's there 's going to be a great deal more clarity at the end of June but once the that report our peer review and that report has been been through the council processes and in front of the councillors Madame Aaron in light of the response that mr. holland 's provided to us here this evening uh I 'm going to foreshadow that I put forward a motion to council this matter be adjourned until the ordinary meeting to be held in December 2019 thanks counselor Alice do you have a question counselor white yes I did but have we moved beyond questions it was okay so it was more a comment that I would suggest at this stage that the that the entire area up there is lost to farming due to the size of the allotments and the infrastructure that 's already in place in the consideration that it might be something as industrial would also be lost because what who would want a factory he saw their beautiful home in a rural setting so I feel that even though no one would want to lay blame we we find that this entire area is lost so everything else other than rural living alright lost to to everything other than rural living so counselors as I was as I try to explain previously the time to look at this growth front and for what it might entail will be something that occurs somewhat into the future and it has those two processes dovetailing into each other the rural land use strategy and the bean style growth strategy whatever comes out of most likely I would suggest the bean style growth strategy because it does result in probably a growth front for been style and most likely a look at more urbanized zones potentially that that would be the time to make that decision he 's a rural living is a low-density residential is it rural activities owner as director holders pointed out is it anything another zone is there something that comes up into the future and others owning that we don 't know about which is always obviously something that 's on the cards so counselors I think to make a strategic decision with respect to a growth front a really important aspect of being styles growth he 's a wise logical outcome subdivision which fundamentally also works against what design is currently so I think there is a way to do this and a way for us to make sure that we have the best land used options available to us at a time particular time can slip out thank you madam mayor um with regards to mr. Huxley 's proposal should he have put in his application or advised the applicants that they wish to do that we should be applying a rezoning to this property because the bottom line is what they want to achieve is not achievable within the farm zone which it currently is so it needed to be rezoned into a rural living zone for them to be able to achieve what they want to achieve and I don 't disagree with I do don 't not disagree with my counselors here on the grounds that that area actually is already rural farm living zone if you go straight up Forge Creek Road they 're all small farm let 's not unsimilar in size this is actually on the corner of where those farms all start and zone and what they 're asking is not is not unachievable but the bottom lines is our council has not moved with the times because we asked last year could we please revisit the bean style growth strategy and that work has not been done they keep going saying to us oh there 's a lot of work involved with that we understand it but when is that going to be done so councilor in terms of reviewing the rural land new strategy we 're having that strategy peer-reviewed right now so that will come through to Council for consideration at a later date in terms of whether crowler Sadler would advise their clients whether or not to push forward with an application or a plain scheme amendment I probably can 't answer that in totality but one of the difficulties that they may have in trying to suggest to their clients to push forward with the proposed rezoning is where 's the strategic work that would underlie a planning scheme amendment to be successfully progressed through the state government processes that has to hence why they may have determined but ultimately that 's a question that I can 't really give a proper answer to because I 'm not paying their organisation council ratinho I think you matter me I 'm really struggling with the fact that by default this area already looks like feels like a rural living zone and sure we can do all sorts of things to see if that 's what comes out of the puzzle once we throw in all these reviews my other concern is that we 've been caught up with the marine precinct recently where that was a 10-year old document we 've got the bean style grow strategy which is a 10-year old document and I put support what counselor pearls were saying about we really do urgently need to reduce some of these strategic documents in the event that this may be dealt with tonight would there be an alternate motion available yes maybe if I was to provide this through you met Emir yes thanks mister can can I just speak to that question no madam me thanks I 'm just interested in what wouldn 't what 's clear that we don 't know what will be the outcome of the current inquiries into the planning scheme says related to council this evening by mr. Holton and mr. hollows any alternative unless it 's and are German I can 't see is providing any justice to either the applicant nor to counsels planning processes mr. hull are you able to answer that question so madam area I think we 've spent enough time talking about council offices view I recommend Asia remains that this application should be refused but in understanding that council sometimes wishes to contemplate a different motion being put forward by a councillor we 've prepared some wording here for the council which is to approve the subdivision and we 've ensured that the necessary conditions of such an approval as required under the planning scheme are entailed within that motion councillor Reeves did you have a question I 'll actually had a suggestion that I remove that the motion be put I 'll second that put motion I retract my pudding sorry I need a seconder yes do we have a seconder council race I 'll second it Thank You councillor Roberts madam mayor my point of clarification I foreshadowed earlier my intention to put forward a motion that this matter be adjourned until 00 Semba soda and with their and I think I should have had the right I may be wrong the right to have put that notion first so it to to the table and that to be that mattered voted upon before councillor reads is motion thanks counselor Ellis miss Bennett nice to see you are you able to clarify the process room here for shady foreshadowing of motions so I think the only way we could do it would be to adjourn the June further consideration madam Merrill I 'll ask that the motion is tabled by councillor Reeves be adjourned so as I may put forward a motion that the matter be adjourned so means councillor Buckley is second so so now we will put them to seek clarification three three madam if I could just seek clarification from us Bennett if the motions put and lost does that then allow counsel us to put his foreshadowed motion adjournment motion thank you madam mayor and I apologize for the confusion but it 's a complex matter before us tonight councillors we had a straightforward planning applications dealt with a property impacted upon by the growth the been style growth strategy and it 's an important issue the globe to me the been style grow studies is a critical strategic document and needs to be adhered to but in this case there 's some confusion Rea that has arisen for our clear decision-making in the fact that both senior officers are holding and how hollow of brought to our attention that the very nature of the application is under review and that a review is to take place and will be concluded sometime in the coming financial year it 's that being the end of June or July or towards July and that the clear processes for these planning applications in terms of rural living and residential rural living applications will be clear by the end of the end of this year 2019 based on that in in terms of fairness for proper planning outcomes both to the applicants clarify what this area is is it in rural living or should it still be impacted by our been style growth strategy is it matters that need to be clearly understood by counsel I think whatever decision we were to take if we devote either in favor its put forward in the first sorry against approving this application as put forward by councillor reeds as the original motion or alternatively the alternate motion that 's been handed around to us would be an unfair decision on either for either side it 's not proper planning process I think that a a decent decision could be made in December based upon clear thought from our planning offices and therefore I ask each of you to consider my point of view and to support it and adjourn this matter until December 2019 thank you thanks counselor Ellis counsel Buckley I wish to speak it seems to me with the speed that this alternative motion was brought up was the alternative course of action is that the people were expecting this to happen anyway and this is how it was going to turn applicants have another go at the next chance they got so if we were to pass this now all we 've been doing what we 're really doing is speeding up the process and getting the job done now it 's going to come out now in the end so I can 't see any really reason predict to won 't want to adjourn till November when we can get on with it now and that would be the outcome so but in the meantime set to consult we can continue with this matter I 'll second it and I recommended we take that course of action so councillor Buckley you 're clear that you 're supporting to adjourn he 's already he 's already supported mayor council race seems councillor Buckley has withdrawn his seconding of the motion I think I was going to second councillor Alice 's motion if councillor Buckley withdrew it and I was going to speak to that to get the outcome that I think we want correct okay and I 'll raise you another counselors counselors once one thing you aren 't speaking to the basis that I think we 've heard clearly from the officers that there is a process underway at the moment a peer review of all the matters that could actually help us determine this and hearing the conversation from counselor Ellis and rereading this I think that the the proposal is premature at the moment an ad hoc decision making process is the last thing we want as as decision-makers to not make a decision is the last thing we want to do we should make a decision and for us to be the the tail wagging the dog in terms of planning I think is the wrong thing to be doing we should have control of the planning process and be determining what the planning outcomes are going to be for our community rather than individuals and while I originally agreed with the officers recommendation I think that we if we can ask that this be deferred this decision pending the reviews that are likely and that we have been reassured will be coming to us then I think we 'll have a much more strategic and better we want and so I support cancer Alice 's deserve suggestion to defer the decision and ask the proponents to accept that and come back once we have a more clear understanding I 'm second counselor Alice 's motion to defer the decision yes okay so is the motion opposed he 's speaking to the motion I was asked only looking for some clarification regarding this document that was distributed to us which appears to be an alternative has do the applicants have knowledge of your alternatives if I may counsel the wide the officers recommendation is the officers recommendation it 's quite clear the officers recommended that the planning permit application shall be refused that 's it sometimes the wind councillors are considering planning permit applications they were they probably consider a broader and sometimes different set of information than what the planning officers will will consider planning officers will consider it strictly within planning terms when counselors may consider a broader set of circumstances sometimes wherein officers believe that there 's a possibility that the council may make a different decision than what the council officers are recommending but an alternative resolution to ensure that whatever resolution is pi actually meets the standards that are required within the planning scheme so that the whatever motion counselors make can be actioned so that 's why the officers have taken the initiative to ensure that that if the councillors were to make a decision opposing the officers recommendation that there would be a valid and workable and workable decision made by counsel that is the entire reason why that was prepared in advance of this meeting thank you so any speakers yes so do we have any further speakers councillor Tory thank you madam mayor I 'm not sure if this is the one I did mention I think to Aaron week or two ago at a briefing I asked about an alternative motion in regards to your comments councillor Buckley because at the time whether it was this one or another one I did suggest that I would like to see an alternative motion so but in regards to the the motion that counselor Ellis has put before us I do think that that is a far better outcome to take a proper balanced look at where this application actually is I don 't have any particular issue with the application but I 'm happy to support the motion on the table now give it six months and see we 're all right thank you thanks Kent for Tory speakers Ellis I just want to clarify one point this is perhaps the first time I 've ever experienced this situation where I 'm recommendations which was well prepared by mr. hallow that 's put before council for Cal 's to make a clear decision and then a piece of last minute information has come for Council and that 's what 's happened tonight with the revelation of this particularly in our particulars studies into planning planning consequences that we were not that impacted upon the application before council at the time this is not a common piece of confusion at council this is just something a bit unique and to me the appropriate and proper approach to this was to wait for the reports and assessments to be undertaken so as we could make a fair and just a for or against or impacting negatively or positively on our growth strategy would not have served good purpose for any reason so it is for that reason so just to clarify the strength of that argument so thank you I recommend that we support this my or my recommendation thank you thanks counselor Ellis have no further speakers I 'll put councillor Alice 's motion to adjourn this matter until the December 2009 meeting to the vote although 2009-10 what did I say 2019 cap sorry the reason I 'll summarize that by saying met to be adjourned until the ordinary meeting of December 2019 are waiting the outcome of a planning review that impacts this application too many words so put that to the vote all those in favor its motion carried unanimously thank you miss Bennett which was adjourned so if you are willing counsel review what 's it worth counsel no I 'll withdraw that mayor I 'll withdraw my motion that the motion be put Thank You councillor Reeves miss Bennett does that satisfy thank you so we can move along okay item 5.2 point 3 J as it relates to what I 'm PS o 0 to 7 1 5l and lots a 1 2 3 7 8 11 12 14 15 17 to 20 22 to 27 and 29 inclusive on PS 8 0 to 7 180 69 Ashley Street and 114 Newlands Drive Painesville mr. hollow thank you madam mayor councillors you 'd be familiar with this application because it has been the consideration of playing consultative meeting back in December 2018 councilís there 's a proposal that was put forward by a permit applicant to seek to end this agreement councillors I believe you 're well aware of some concerns of some residents of the Paintsville Township and I believe you 're aware of the position of the applicants council officers have had a review of this proposal and we believe it 's appropriate and a good planning outcome to end this legal agreement because allows the consideration of applications reached subdivide new Lecrae Lots within this state on their merits in accordance with a plan scheme and not be subject to legal implications of the agreement new agreements have been entered the issue of a statement compliance very staged to ensure the intent of the section 1 3 agreement takes place that being called in coordinated infrastructure provision appropriately developed open space and staging of the subdivision there is a never intention of the legal agreement to restrict lot sizes within the estate planning policy and respect to the general residential zone areas seeks to encourage diversity of housing types housing growth particularly in locations locations offering good access to service and transport the proposal to end the agreement will not detrimental impact the pains will grow theory structure plan in the event that subdivision permit for land expires a new planning permit will need to be submitted consistent with the pains will grow their instruction plan and should this proposal not to end the agreement as proposed this does not prevent future landowners of nearly creo Lots in this state applying to end agreements as it relates to their specific lot or property happy to take questions Thank You mr. Howe are there questions councillors no we have a motion before us do we have I made our thanks council wish to speak council Robert 's not much to add but this is obviously been a project that 's been worked on for quite some time I Drive through there quite a bit and you can see that it 's very much in development and I think it would be unwise to to prevent any further development in that area so I urge you to support the recommendation thanks counselor Roberts councillor pouts I just want to say this is a bit more of a controlling factor two subdivisions for the subdivisions in in this area so I think it 's good that it 's getting put on at this stage and I think um you know moving into the future we can control those house normal house sized blocks getting subdivided two or three times so I think instead we 've just put it in place to control that density and I think it 's the right thing to do for this proposal yes thanks counsel pouts do you wish to speak against the motion I certainly do counselor Ellis think think you mad at me I look at the site I 've seen the small 400 square meter blocks I believe them to be contrary to good planning and the concept of the original development of this balk at this moment I 've read the the arguments of the proponent and also the arguments of the objectors and I 'm believe it it 's not a good planning outcome to create these smaller blocks within an established and worthwhile subdivision I must for those reasons I encourage councillors not to support this motion thanks council Alice are there any further speakers for the motion that 's the reves I 'm happy to speak in favor of the motion I think that a variety of product in our communities is absolutely appropriate especially in a intensive development area like this and I note and I 'm pretty sure that the future residential village is going to have a very intensive development in it even smaller block sizes and I think again as I said that the the variety of product is totally appropriate in this day and age and in this particular area it 's what we should be also like to speak in in favor of this sum this particular issue I 'd live two houses away from a very similar orbit only 10 lot subdivision that has average of about between 450 and 500 square meters and I must say I do let it drops around there occasionally and whilst when I first saw that proposal come up I shuddered at the thought of what might happen in there I must say I have been very surprised at the outcome there it does offer a diversity of housing for for different people and different requirements that the people have nowadays so I am in support of this motion thanks to any further speakers that in mind I 'll put the recommendation to all those in favor those against cancer Ellis and council white motion carried 70 thank you item 5.2 point for planning application number 291 slash 2018 p v Vincent president like bungo multi lot subdivision and works mr. Hawley thank you madam mayor and councillors councillors who you 'll be familiar with this particular application once again because it came before planning consultative meeting on for a 48 lot subdivision this application came forward as a previously approved 100 lot subdivision then incorporated this part or this particular application had expired and they were required to come in to finalize and get a planning permit for the remainder of their estate council recall that most of the concerns in relation to this application about a specific number of matters the concerns for objectors has been primarily drainage loss of views the state that the reserve will be to cancel and there has been some concerns about road connections and traffic on to other existing roads what I can advise councilors is that the application was sent to VicRoads for their comment and our internal engineers have reviewed the road structures and the intersections and they believe that they 're appropriate in terms of the drainage engineers have reviewed the proposal and they believe that the the subdivision can be drained appropriately and without too much difficulty and of course there will be the requirement to lodge drainage plans and road construction plans for final approval and for the engineers final sign-off and review in terms reserve there 's conditions requiring that reserve to be handed over to Council and a fit proper state and that will require works to be undertaken there is a need for obviously utility provision there 's the need for footpath connections and I 'm happy to take questions with a recommendation in front of your councils for a notice of decision to grant a permit thanks mister highway questions councillor white thank you madam mayor mr. hollows will the Recreation Area will that be maintained by the subdivide us for a period of time before handover correct councilor it will be it 'll be maintained for a period of two years before it is officially handed over to Council any further questions no recommendation thanks counselor retain a counselor Reeves do you wish to speak to the recommendation counsel retainer and I just like to thank the officers for the work they 've done on this been a long time coming and I think the report speaks for itself thank you thanks counselor Tina counselor raised and once again as per my previous comments you know providing a variety of for the future growth of our community can you speak is against counselor Ellis thank you madam mayor when this application for a hundred units first came before council some years ago I was the only counselor that voted against the application and it 's really quite possible that I could still be reenact this again tonight but I see this is a more of a social issue and Melander draining each drainage and planning issue we 're creating and a subdivision of a hundred units in at the end of a one ways of a one way in street complex the areas contained by topography and by Crown land a Crandall land allotments leading onto Lake Bunga Beach rinse in place faces each other on varying size blocks we 've no way in and no way out there are no no public services to this subdivision development it 's not close to any schools it 's not close to even a convenience store we are creating a different style of neighborhood into the future I feel that despite the arguments put forward by the applicant that this is not into the future I would like to be proof and wrong and guess time will show that in terms of the drainage I 've been lobbied by a number of people and one per family in particular in relation to the complexities of the drainage systems there this argument was put forward in the previous application many years ago and and according to the people have been approaching me the uses of the drainage has still yet to be resolved there 's a series of dams and other assets that are associated with the drainage program including a large dam on land that is going to become council 's responsibility as council widest ascertained in another two years time if we have a serious rain event or something similar Council will incur a burden whether it be financial or or other because we will be responsible for these projects as I say if you look at the social planning concept comes for this application that the input into traffic and those roads there and if councillors who have been to this particular place look and recall the area you will I encourage councils to look outside the concept of just the matters that we 've been spayed speaking to earlier and consider the consequences I 've highlighted my words just given and can reconsider their position if they are considering supporting application and vote now against this application it could have been presented to Council in a far different manner I encourage you not to vote no to this matter thank you any further speakers for speakers against no council ratinho your right of reply thanks madam mayor like to thank councils for his comments in relation to the access we have many examples of one Road in one Road out mallacoota BEM River New Orleans arm or with various types of housing stock and I think in relation to social pressures there 's real pressures on all tiers of government around affordable housing so we do have to consider also all sorts of different housing stock as you suggested before council roofs so I think for those reasons we need to support this recommendation and so I 'll leave it at that thanks Mimi thanks counselor Tino I 'll against motion Mike a motion carried seven to retain a and raise five point two point five planning permit application to eight 20 18 p application for a two lot subdivision a twenty-nine Big Creek Road brutha n-- and speaker to this agenda item mr. Tai Armstrong and Stu reminder you have five minutes good evening councillors my name is Tom strong and I 'm a horse breaker from breathing I 'm the applicant for the planning permit to 8 6 2 0 1 8 p I started my horse training business approximately 3 years ago and since then I 've gotten busier busier then I initially thought at the time I didn 't realize there was such a demand for horse trainers in the area which is now why I employ two women casually to help me get through my daily workload with that said I 've found there still isn 't enough hours in the day to maintain such a large acreage to its full potential and on initial purchase of my property my immediate neighbor expressed interest in purchasing my back paddocks as it stands the location it has everything I need however the excess acreage is not and I feel it would be a shame to see good usable farmland being reclaimed by the joining bush land due to my time constraints thanks mr. Armstrong mr. Chris Carney from beverage Williams Co would you please come to the microphone and you also have five minutes thank you madam mayor I 'd like to thank you all for giving the opportunity to speak in relation to planning permit application to eight 20 18 p my name is Chris Cano I 'm a principal planner with Victoria 's largest land survey firm beverage Williams Co I work out of our been silenced our officers submissions I 'll provide this evening a mate on behalf of ty who is the applicant for the permit the aim of the submission is to demonstrate the council the wisdom in supporting the ground of a planning permit first I 'll outline exactly why I want to subdivide his land second I 'll outline why we believe the officers are mistaken in suggesting these reasons aren 't in accordance with councils policies third that have been raised by council officers in their report finally I 'll discuss what we think counts we 'll be making the correct decision by granting a planning permit so this is why I wants to subdivide his land he 's a horse trainer by trade he chose this 58.3 2 hectare property because it 's just off the grill great open road and just outside of breathin ty intended to train horses in the round yards next to the house at the front of the property and Grace and livestock on the balance land for some extra income however the horse-breaking business has since flourished the extent that he now has no time to look after grazing livestock so rather than use these valuable time up mending fences tending to sick animals and controlling wild dogs he wants to sell the farmland off to someone whose business is grazing and concentrate his energies and his finances on horse training at the front of the land the subdivision has been designed to leave toy exactly as much land as he needs at the front of the property to do council offers a mistaken in suggesting that Ty 's reasons for subdividing aren 't in accordance with the council 's and states policies Council officers have put a proposition before council suggesting that you should refuse tires request reading the report it appears that this proposition is based upon the assumption that he 's attempting to create a rural lifestyle block at the front of the property it is true the state and local planning policies relating to agriculture and the provisions of the farming can be interpreted to support the officers of you about subdivisions that lead to that outcome however once you understand that ties is trying to creating trying to create a a block that allowed to pass the balance of his farm on to a grazer so we can focus all of his energies and finances on horse training you 'll realize that the officers proposition is mistaken grazing livestock and breaking horses are both completely legitimate agricultural activities that are strongly encouraged by the state and local planning policies relating to the farming zone so the subdivision which will facilitate both land users is not reason we believe that the council officers proposition to yourselves is based upon a misunderstanding of what Troy is really trying to achieve I 'd now like to turn my attention to the two other matters the council officers raised concerns with ie bushfire risk and the potential risk of erosion it 's a mandatory requirement for any subdivision carried out in the bush fire management overlay that evidence be provided to counsel that the vacant block being created cannot accommodate a dwelling we provided evidence to Council and CFA that the vacant block we 're creating could accommodate a dwelling that met the requirements of the bushfire Management overlay as part of this application as stated in the officer 's report the CFA provided conditional consent to the subdivision based upon that evidence so the experts in assessing bushfire risk are satisfied for that reason we find it most confusing that council officers are putting forward a proposition to counsel that their assessment of bushfire rich risk which came to the opposite conclusion is somehow superior in relation to the risk of erosion I can confirm that the track the farm block it 's an existing track and hence no works are required to it if that needs to be clarified through a permit condition we 're happy to have that included in the permit granted in closing I would like to outline why we believe Council we 're making the correct decision by granting a planning permit tie is a successful small business owner who wants to grow his business in a location that has proven perfect for his customers and himself we believe that he has come to Council with a perfectly legitimate request that meets the council 's and states planning policies for farming areas far from disrupting agricultural activity letting him subdivide off his horse training business from the balance farmland will lead to more farming activity we understand why council offices are targeting unscrupulous developers who will fragment farming areas just to make a quick buck but ty is not one of those people we believe that if council looks at Ty 's proposal in the clear light of day it will see that the planting scheme actually encourages it so we contend that ty and not punish him for the sins of others thank you thank you mr. Cano mr. Howlett thank you madam ma 'am madam Erin councillors you 're heard discussions about the firing zone tonight in your feeder previously I don 't intend you to take you through those blow-by-blow I think one of the difficulties of dealing with playing permits like this is how they 're often presented to council officers I can clearly advise counsel the we were not aware that the balanced of this allotment would have been sold to a nearby neighbor we were not aware that the and was not put forward as part of the application that this balanced allotment would be put into another rural enterprise one of the difficulties if applications come through that aren 't framed in such a manner with such information and offering up agreements at the officer at the onset of the application and providing a clear picture of what the agricultural outcome is council officers unfortunately have to address what 's in front of them in an application at this stage in front of us in application from a 57 hectare property counselors it 's inappropriate to have a rural living outcome in a farming zone area you know that we 've discussed this many times before and I won 't use any more of your time on that discussion the difficulty I have with also the proposition put tonight by the principle of beverage Williams is that the application was supported with information advising that the CFA were comfortable with a dwelling being put onto the balanced lot yes to see if I did not object but the CFA considers cos considers as part of the referral process for dwellings in bushfire Management overlay areas matters of a technical nature should council decide to allow a dwelling to be put in that environment given the fact that this land is on the border of a very large fuel source we say it would be inappropriate to allow the opportunity to create a balance lock which allows the use of the land for a dwelling to be as of right it would need a permit under the bushfire Management overlay but the question is should we allow high-risk area to come forward into the future as well as part of this consideration tonight councillors we were also concerned about whether this proposal was completely clear when it came to us and one of the concerns we raised and I would just take you to a figure within the documentation and if I can take you to the figure to where it has the subject land marked in red and exercise lot marked in blue that was created in the past so once again councillors this is the second bite of the cherry when it comes to this land if I can take you to that figure for a demonstration of the fact that there is a track that comes around the current dwelling heads in a northerly direction and heads out to the balance of the farm we could not get clarification through the planning permit applicant that that track would have been within lot that was not forthcoming so one of the concerns that we had was would there be legal access to this land and how would it be resolved and the answer was it certification process down the track which we thought that 's not a great response from a planning perspective we need to know if there 's going illegal access so we felt it was unresolved councils unfortunately as I said we can only make a decision on the information in front of us if this application had come forward in another way in another manner that explained the the desires of mr. Armstrong maybe we wouldn 't have been here tonight with his recommendation in front of us counselors we have a recommendation for refusal of the application and I 'm happy to take questions thank you thanks mr. hollow counselor tyno did you have a question just had a question for mr. hallow it 's probably somewhat academic but in that instance where you described the balance of land going to another grazing enterprise would we need to be satisfied that that was a definite arrangement yes counselor exactly we would have to be satisfied now there is numerous ways that you could do so you could actually incorporate that other grazers land into the subdivision proposal another way is balanced allotment to that other agricultural pursuit but if that comes forward in an application that means that we know what the end result is and we may well made a different decision in respect to this application thank you let 's count the pelts what options are available to the proponent to movies quest forward the the applicants would have the ability to do two things they could seek to have the matter reviewed by the Victorian civil administrative tribunal or alternatively they could seek to put forward a different application with appropriate information that demonstrates mr. Armstrong 's wants as well as his neighbors to try and get a bit of agricultural outcome the results from this subdivision application me is is there opportunity for counselors to also defer this application until further information is given which is what you 're stating or this proponent to be able to move this application forward yes there is an opportunity for counselors defer the decision as to whether we 'll get the information coming forward I 'm just not sure about it 's a matter outside of my control so more clarity with regards to the alternative farm use of the the person that proposing to purchase the lot that 's for sale is that information enough for you to be able to warrant a permit to subdivide this as such counsel there 's a lot of questions in one I believe that we should proceed with the recommendation because as the application stands and has been put forward it doesn 't give us any confirmation or information or suggestion of a different a different outcome being driven by this proposal I believe would be more prudent for a new proposal to come forward that demonstrated that and a decision could be made on that proposal and without having that information in front of us we 're trying to preempt what may or may not come forward so I think a more prudent proposal is to forward with the recommendation tonight have the permit applicants provide further information have discussion with Council Planning officers to see whether or not a new application would alter our decision and would indeed be supportive come at an additional cost to the proponent yes just might add that if the application was refused and a new application was forthcoming that contained the information that we were previewed to tonight if there were no objectors officers could make a decision under delegation and there would be no need for the application to come back into the chamber thanks mr. Holden councillor tui Thank You mr. hollow is it possible to put a condition on the granting of a permit that the balanced allotment be amalgamated or consolidated would is is that a way of going about achieving an outcome tonight technically I think we 'd be found at fault because we have to include all the land that takes the forms part of the application councillor Reeves so I think mr. hollar you probably answered my questions in your discussion but I 'm sort of looking across to the proponent and wondering you know if if they 've heard enough information to actually come back to you with a revised application if this recommendation is carried tonight I hope so counselor we would also always have our doors open to have fruitful discussions about how we would welcome those discussions to take place councillor Buckley how soon can they reply it 's a matter of days a matter of days Thank You councillor Ellis actually you 're probably the wrong to answer this being a teacher mounted mirror and that that is I 've kind of just lost trying to calculate what a thousand square metres a block of that size amounts to in the old language of either a hick takers or two acres okay with that then the question I have den is is there a minimum size because two acres to me sounds very small for the sort of business the proponents promoting here he 's watch the smart minimum size for a business to be recognized as a agricultural entity you know with land I know that you know woods can be twenty acres and things like that so what 's what 's the minimum size mr. hallo mr. Hollow please answer I think the counselors are quite apt in their discussion saying that depends horses sorry for the part of horses for courses it depends what your what your enterprise can work off smaller land parcels some enterprises need very vast land parcels so I think there 'd be more a question of a agricultural scientists rather than myself but we work through with the permit applicants so that 's the best I can do sorry counselor counselor why thank you madam mayor um just I was I was also looking if this became an annexed situation that would also the access issue as well you wouldn 't have to worry about tracks and erosion because their own axis that sounds very logical to me counselor any further questions with that being said there 's a recommendation before do we have a mover Thanks councillor tui councillor Reeves speakers given give me any information that that we 've been given tonight I would expect that um we would receive a new application in the coming week with the information in there that the council 's asked for and would like to think that there be an outcome that works for every month the second I wish to speak this is a motion opposed no further speakers I 'd like to 're creating an imposter on an applicant and very similar situation we find ourselves in as to the earlier matter that we became bogged down in and that is that fresh information or information that should have been provided to our planning department hasn 't been planning and there 's this information impacts upon their decision-making and that 's a very difficult thing sending someone way to reapply is that fair versus are journeying the matter I 'm really not sure so but well that 's what I 'm saying I just should he pay that fee but anyhow with that there are clear rules and in relation to this matter so unfortunately I have to come along with the recommendation that 's before us but it is something that we should have considered thank you accounts rellis if there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion to all those in favor motion carried unanimously madam madam am I be excused counselor what counselors better mayor the reasons for my leaving the room is that this application just it clear that you okay I have a conflict of Neil I did not acknowledge you at the start of the council meeting so I recognize former councillor and former mayor mr. Peter Neil thank you five point two point six planning permit application three seven eight slash 2018 slash P use and development of land for group accommodation at 275 Hardee 's Road me tongue mister hollow you have been busy tonight thank you madam me counselors this is an application for the use and development of land for group accommodation counselors will recall this application because it was subject to a planning consultative meeting planning the the councils will recall this application as well because it was subject to a previous they can 't just determination counselors we have been at pains to try and get an outcome here that would result in something other than a refusal but unfortunately this feels like a repeat application and I don 't want to take all councils further time in going over this application blow-by-blow except I would I would like to go to the specifics within a report about consideration of previous VCAT decisions counselors I 've provided you been seen by the tribunal as leading reasons for why councils must consider decisions the repeat applications with great wine and what they say counselors is that basically in my view of reading of these decisions is we must have to give great weight to the previous decisions of of a tribunal and not reverse those decisions unless there 's been a change of circumstance to justify a different view reverse the previous decision only with great caution and a proven all teeth proposal relative to a previously rejected one only if there has been significant changes to the proposal with circumstances planning policy or the interpretation of facts and laws a further follow up decision at the tribunal set out factors where this might where you might defer a decision and then a significant changes in application itself changes in the circumstances of the land and it surrounds changes in planning policy or changes in interpretation of facts or law relevant to the tribunals previous considerations now if I can police have the indulgence just to read for a minute having regard for the above is considered the council change to the current proposal from a that considered previously by the true tribunal in this case the summary is follows the proposed use of esophagram group accommodation remains unchanged the general siting of the proposed new to dwellings is the same be to the north of the existing dwelling the proposed set back to Lake King is the same the architectural style of the buildings are different the architectural form of the buildings is different proposed two storeys the original application proposed single-story the two dwellings have a common wall similar to the previous proposal the new dwellings are detached from the main dwelling same as the previous application so we say that imbalance is considered that the current proposal does not reserve represents to give you a change to that previously forming part of previous consideration by the tribunal having regard to the fine there is not been seen if we can change to the proposal the proposed uses the same there has been no change to the circumstances affecting land or its surrounds and and no naught has any any being put forth to counsel the planning change of planning policy there 's no change in the interpretation of facts of law as a parent or has been put forth to council based on these factors counselors we consider that this application it should be refused it is inconsistent with the farming zone the try the previous tribunal decision remains in our view valid and very important and must be taken with great weight and we also believed that the bill form outcome is inconsistent with a significant landscape overlay counselors there 's a recommendation for refusal I 'm happy to take questions thanks mr. hollow okay no thanks counselor Ellis sorry counts we 're doing Spanky 's No all right that said I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor I wish I was against one motion carried seven one councillor Buckley Thank You counselor Ellis five point three point one draft revised council plan 2017 to 2021 mr.

from councillor mark briefs or a leave of absence until the December meeting okay councillor to a second it all those in favor thank two questions from mr. Morris for guilt of Lakes Entrance Thank You mr. Bob okay on top of this one good mannered a code of practice restricts carnival to 28 days Council has loops repeatedly assured the community and myself that the annual Lakes Entrance Christmas carnival is operated under the good neighbor code of practice for a circus and carnival which mandates amongst other things that accountable can only occupy a site for a maximum of 28 days otherwise a planning permit is required the life-sentenced carnival stays for more than 50 days how is this carnival legitimately able to stay for more than 28 days without the planning permit if you change the colonel is not bound by the good-neighbor code of practice please 32 what system it is operated under maybe it 's time to end the deceit and get a planning permit and there 's still time before Christmas Thank You mr. Holden respond to that question mr. bull kelp so the good neighborhood code of practices it applies to these these things does apply to Crown land and council does ask that the provider of comply with the general principles of the good neighborhood practice but the carnival itself takes place within the context of the lakes summer festival and some years ago in 2013 council sought and received comprehensive legal advice that because it is the car will takes place within the context of that festival which will include a range of activities including summer markets a woodchop event a duck race and of course the iconic Lakes Entrance fireworks display so when we receive legal advice on the matter it was advised us that the Lakes Entrance summit foreshore festival does not lead a planning permit and is not required to meet the GNC P because it is a festival and as such can include temporary amusements right I chose stalls for games or snacks and as such there are no time constraints associated with the event Council has also in place a comprehensive event management plan for the event which in itself far exceeds the general requirements of the GMC thanks mister if I could repeat the first part the GNC P does apply to Crown land in most cases however and amusements and the stalls complies with the general principles of the GNC beef we include that as a guideline in the information that is distributed as part of the Aoi please ensure that you meet these guidelines in general however because of the context and the nature and of the lakes entrance summer foreshore festival the carnival can take place within that context without the need to expressly apply every aspect including the 28-day limit so there was no need for planning permit however we do request that the operators of the carnival element of that Lakes Entrance summer festival adheres to the basic principles of the good neighbor Thank You mr. Holten mr. Bourg out would you like to make your second question to a boy perhaps he cannot as was no question there was no okay can you please move on to the second question you 've submitted please mr. bourdelle that 's all photos question oops wrong one I 've taught this one incompetent carnival AIO process due to the seriously and inadequate answer to last month 's question on the flawed explosion of interest process for the yo-yo the OI occurred out of a Christmas carnival operators busiest time that is that is ending two days before the start of the Melbourne show and covering the whole of the Brisbane Adelaide shows and being conducted 16 months before the carnival starts and one perspective tenderer receiving highly inaccurate answers to pertinent questions 29 days after asking and three days after the PIO closed including not answering what parts of the good neighbour code of practice canceled expects operators to adhere to and apparently advertising for the a I was in local papers whereas in previous years it was also advertised on tenderly which is considered the industry standard for tenders and otherwise continuing our latest points why won 't_''_973.3 the council end the aoi and redo it in a more professional and competent manner and if you disagree with any of the proceeding price please detail what and why mr. Holden thank you for your question mr. bull kelp um your opinion that the process was flawed we don 't and the procurement the procurement was conducted in accordance with the East Gippsland Shire Council procurement do not intend to add to take the process again if you would like me to answer in detail every specific point you may I will provide that on those mr. but got bug out mr. Holland said he 'll provide that answer to your notice that part must go in just one moment yes it will go into the minutes okay Thank You mr. Boyd gavel thank you okay okay one point eight a record of the assemblies of counselors I listed before you do we have a mobile happy to move that madam me Thank You mr. Eaton counsellor retain aye thanks counselor white all those in favor aye 1.9 petitions I mean a million other petitions thank you two notices of motion or or rescission there 's no notices emotions or rescissions three deferred business deferred business madam mayor thank you okay number four counselor reports counselor do we thank you madam mayor the first time I 've used that term my report is it 's reasonably brief I have sent it in to council offices but the one thing that I would like to highlight from Custom Club swap meet that happened over at Lucknow and given that I 'm a car person I went over there and I very much enjoyed the day the weather was absolutely fantastic which they 're suggesting did help with they they calculated about a thousand visitors on the day now I probably don 't need to explain to everybody what sort of benefit that that gives our community there was 98 stall holders there excuse me and and they had people from as far away as Shepherd in Geelong and yay who who attended this this gathering they also the lakes does rod club actually raised 1,500 for Mellon 's cottage now that 's a facility down in lakes entrance that assists young children with with cancer issues they also they also had the Lucknow Football Netball Club run a canteen on the day they took over 2,800 for the day and and this is this is all done by a group of people who who just have a love for cars and and want other people to participate and enjoy them so I they 're they 're a think they do just a fantastic job and a job that benefits every member of our community and it was a very enjoyable day thank you Thanks careful to a council retainer and I think you met him air if I can indulge you briefly I 'd like to acknowledge the the sad attack on a good friend of the CEOs Sisto the part owners Pellegrini 's in that vicious attack on our freedoms as a community I also knew Sisto for quite a large amount of time and he was a well-known icon in Melbourne and it 's with your indulgence just wanted to respectfully acknowledge that madam mayor I 'd like to talk about the East Gippsland Business Awards your annual awards have grown into an annual peak event for celebrating poor things business this year another record crowd and I was assisted with their counselor white there on the night there was in excess of 300 people we need to acknowledge the great work that Janet Burton did in putting all the judging and all the other volunteers that helped judge all the categories the Platinum category of notice was the special recognition award that is the East Gippsland shows award and this year 's recipient was Glenn Curtis as you know Glenn Curtis is an artisan jeweler who was born in August and runs his business right here in band style selling his jewelry all around the world most recently most recently he was recognized for providing gold pendants to the prince and making Markel when they visited Australia it 's interesting that on the Burnet salt the demographics group one of the key things in in a successful region is having a successful business awards are big ticking that one and we can keep working towards the others the second thing that I would like to speak about is the Masters Road national cycling event we were thrilled to host this year 's event and when you consider that last year 's event was held on the Gold Coast 2017 it was a major achievement and I think our events team for helping pull that together and we look forward to the post review on that event to see what sort of economic benefit actually from that Australian cycling group to talk to us about holding the national event here again next year and again that just happens to be another item on the Burnet salt successful regions checklist national event ticket but also like to speak about the recent upgrades of the federation training bands they 'll campus upgrades they 've upgraded their hospitality area the oak tree restaurant the oak tree rests on is been rebuilt and has it been it has an expanded footprint the restaurant for now caps lapels can you please the restaurant can now cater for 65 person seated and all 90 persons for a cocktail event the restaurant furniture has been built from locally sourced hardwood timber something you 'd be interested in Council pearls a commercial kitchen with state of the art equipment with additional floor space to accommodate larger student groups it 's a significant move in the right direction after the food event that was held at Lindo last night we are being recognized as a as a destination restaurant area and this facility will help there 's also new facilities for nursing training situated looks like a hospital ward right there for armed to train people in that sector there 's also professional services wing and the newly unveiled facilities highlight the major upgrades of the Bansal TAFE campus and I liberally call it taste because I believe they 're looking at rebranding back to TAFE where everybody understands and knows what type is the benzol campus upgrades are a major boost for the local TAFE delivering new integrated training facilities and extensions to the current classrooms vocational trainings and pathway training facilities again ticks the Burnet salt must-haves 26th of October I was privileged to be invited to the Prime Minister 's National drought summit I attended this summit in Canberra held at the Old Parliament House the summit was attended by all state and territory premiers including all relevant agriculture ministers and advisers it was honor to attend on behalf of the Victorian local government area and one of the drought affected areas East Gippsland as well as Wellington local government in to attendees included Rob Chandler mayor of barkal Deane regional councils got Ferguson mayor of Blaney Shire Council in New Peninsula district in Kimba South Australia in attendance from alga was David o Lachlan pres and Adrienne Beresford Wiley the CEO other key people invited to speak at the day were Major General Steve and Dave who happens to be the coordinator general for drought pick Courtney ABC land line dr. Steve Hadfield Dodds the Australian Bureau of agricultural resources economics and Sciences ABS and dr. Steven stone general manager for agriculture and the Bureau of Meteorology division the summit round table was an opportunity for participants to discuss on how Australia should respond to drought now and more importantly into the future participants gave their views on improving supplementing current drought assistance and relief across affected areas building preparedness and resilience for the future participants contributed at the round table on the following areas there was a discussion group around individuals and families ensuring that individuals and families affected by drought can continue to meet their basic needs the second item was round farms ensuring that support farm businesses is coordinated accessible appropriate practical and so that business decisions are made now so that farm businesses can prosper when focus to ensure that initiative programs and policies support the maintenance of economic activity to help counter the knock-on effect in local economies and to build social resilience I 've completed a separate report on my trip which was circulated to my colleague councillors on Sunday the 28th of October 2018 this summary report articulates the key issues and takeouts from the summit for local government I also announced on that summit was the Prime Minister 's announcement of the five billion dollar package for the National at the national summit and the key points were around the Commonwealth government 's announced five million dollar drought fund the initial 3.9 million in the fund which will be increased by five B and by 2028 a hundred million will be made available each year from 2020 and that is around how we future-proof against drought for F army part of our economy legislation to create the fund is required a board of guardians will be appointed to allocate them funding can be used for community services research adoption of technology and infrastructure that supports long-term sustainability there are indications funding may to discuss ways to spend the money and waste of approving it governments will be modeled on the medical research Future Fund and 3.9 billion source from building Australia fund the Prime Minister indicated he may be making further announcements about drought supporting during the summit interview and he also indicated that as the drought bites in further for East Gippsland in Wellington that will be further considerations in what they 've already allocated to us some key concerns that were raised around that five billion dollars were allocations from fun won 't begin until 2020 there is no resourcing of schools or building farmers capability in business and risk management it is unclear whether the focus is on drought response or preparedness 100 million per annum is not enough how does this fit the discussions around the intergovernmental agreement given it is focused on preparedness and ensuring businesses are ready to manage drought and the governance what will the Australian government do to ensure that allocations from the fund are not politicized and that the support is made available at the appropriate time also during the month I was training centre by Meg 's and she also is keen to give us some feedback Paul in relation to our off dog lead facilities that we recently announced and I think we should probably take her up on that offer madam mayor thank you for your indulgence thanks councillor retainer councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor this sunday always Buchan South Avenue of honour to attend the Remembrance Day ceremony I have a strong connection with the buck an area my mum was raised there my grandmother lives in Tim Barra my grandfather used to be the principal of the back and primary school so as a pleasure to join the community on such an day commemorating centenary of the First World War armistice in attendance was the thirteenth Gippsland light horse regiment the riders were a sight to behold wearing original uniforms from when the regiment was originally raised in 1915 Evelyn Schmidt began the formal introduction but was soon interrupted by a mobile phone but in typical buckin fashion she shook it off and proclaimed that she was so happy that button finally had decent mobile phone coverage horses causing it to throw its rider the rider had in fact not ridden in 12 months the last time she had ridden she 'd been front thrown from her horse and had broken her pelvis this time thankfully she was unhurt after settling the horse we continued on to the last post with a minute 's silence observed in the middle except a technical glitch with the cd-player meant that we got to listen to the bugle call twice and had about five minutes of silence in between while the issue was resolved the crowd were in good spirits and weren 't gonna be bothered by the hiccup after the commemoration was closed we moved in to have a yarn and a cup of coffee and a cordial I noticed after a few mouthfuls that there wasn 't just water and cordial in the drink but also a substantial number of regulars curdled it courtesy of the tank water regardless the cordial was a massive hit with the kids requiring many requiring many refills and somebody tapped me on the shoulder and mentioned to me just before I left remain on the surface of the water sealing it to keep the oxygen out killing the wrigglers without much fuss thanks for having me again bucking and without a devoted community members like Evelyn Schmidt these important events may not continue and I thank you for your work and look forward to coming back soon it 's

titles and it was a great big weekend have to congratulate Michael crane for his efforts as president of that club and it was such a great event that as you would have read in the press they 've already been asked to hold the event again next year with that there was hundreds and hundreds of people came to town everything was booked out and they slept in all the accommodation and a doll they 're beautiful fujas so they had and they did say that had a wonderful weekend there was a great event um Lions at window put on a breakfast the other Sunday they didn 't want to call it a drought get together they didn 't feel that that was perhaps the right way but it was a community get together just to morning which was very good then Remembrance Day I tend to fence tile the work that the people particularly a lot of ladies put into and knitting all those properties that were on the Senate are just absolutely amazing the the the speeches were very hard because of a beam of 100 analysis but what was particularly call it disturbing was that they made crosses and put them in the center of the lawn there been style industry so just been stolen history at that time over two hundred and forty young men and women never never returned the staggering number of casualties for what would have been a small town and it was very fitting liberation and and then last night I always asked the speaker you know judge it was new more people there than I did and actually tried to give him my speech to say well it 's free to a good home but he made me get up and speak a wonderful group of people doing a tremendous job to to showcase what we do in this area and it was just it 's great these restaurants and and using the restaurants are using our local products like brown here so the way it 's grown since last year it 's amazing and if it continues to grow like that we 've just got such a strong community in the field of eating thank you very much thanks counselor why council pelts and on the 2nd of November I represented the mayor the new mayor at the official opening of the timber East Gippsland exhibition which was held at the East Gippsland art gallery here in Bend style I felt attached to this meeting because it was part of the timber industry which I 'm proudly involved in the guest speaker was Stan Collins who has committed a lifetime to the industry he 's worked as a timber worker and later as a as a manager and advocated wonderfully for the hardwood products of the region and it was a different exhibition and they actually had different clientele going through the art gallery which were pleased about and it was actually put on by the Historical Society of bends down and they had all it lot of people go there was a lot of information in there and worth looking at so I could recommend anyone to go through that exhibition I think it 's still on now after that I last Wednesday I took off and went to win up the princess highway to Wollongong to represent our region in the seats group which is the southeastern transport systems and it is a 16 based council that has interest with regards to cross border issues and the princess highway we have the kate for upgrading safety upgrades to the princess highway and better Road usage rail freight airports and basically we had a really interesting meeting I 'm actually the chair of that group now which I came about at the last meeting which is quite an honor for me given the fact that I 've now been involved in that group for 10 years so I 'm now sick they 're saying I remember when this happened and the basis behind that is this so basically they announced the Victorian cross border commissioner as being Luke Wilson who is a long term state established in his in that area and and will do a great job and they seem to be pleased to I 'm have him as the new representative so we think that he will be interested in talking to us because it was soup that initiated the first cross-border issues with one of the documents that we actually had made up by some of our freelance people and it highlighted problems between the borders and the the issues that we have in regards to safety bushfires SES ambulance call-outs and just the the issues that happen along the Victorian New South Wales borders and they actually happen not in the Victorian South Australian borders and New South Wales Queensland borders so there 's join is there that we share quite often our our jobs don 't just sit in our own zone so that was something that was really great to see that we 've been able to fill that seats is working hard on rail hero projects and the princess highway hero projects they will be based on strategic documentation of crash data and we no longer say accident saying there 'll be analyzing stick out issues with regards to safety upgrades and economic benefits to our regions and I don 't know whether everyone knows this but the third of the populations live in rural Victoria or rural New South Wales however two thirds of the accidents actually happen in this area so this is it something that we 'll be highlighting and working with state government about the fact that most crashes happen in rural Victoria or the rural areas it 'll be something that will be really putting in as a base to our arguments to state and federal government in regards to safety upgrades finally we had a deliverance from Jeff Boleyn and he 's from the koomer manaro progress Association and they 've got a really they 've been working hard on a concept plan for a rail link from Canberra to the Eden port and it 's been something that 's been mentioned for many years now and the particular interest to us was I did ask them whether they were looking at a part two which would incorporate linkage from Ben 's this stage they haven 't done a feasibility study and a cost analysis yet but the bottom line is they predict that it will cost a billion dollars from Canberra to fajn Bala and then another billion dollars from BOM Bala to Evie but I will leave these documents on the table downstairs for us to have a look at and it might be interesting at some stage for us to contact him and get their progress association to come and check with us when we have our big East Gippsland hired cross-border meetings and we can sort of loop into what works already being done and a great deal of work has been established at this stage and given the fact that vaguer is actually a vulnerable seat they 're getting money thrown at them left right and center and they have had a commitment from one of their members up there that they will throw a million dollars at a feasibility study for them so I thought that was a curious process to what 's come about but with that said I 'm exhausted and I 'm happy pouts Council what if it 's okay to back at one place I 've forgotten something quite important that I would have liked to have said if that 's okay children it 's not an event that I went to it 's a phone call I took from Margo at the plains or Lions Club and it was to say that they are not putting on the fireworks this year in Paynesville but it was to say that they putting 5,000 towards drought assistance instead which i think is just an unbelievable gesture from them and also that they are well on the way to raising a sec five thousand dollars to donate also so I really do applaud those people because they are hardworking and there 's not a not a big group and they have aged now but they are very hardworking and they 're certainly very sincere so thank you thanks counselor what thank you madam mayor I did forget to mention on the weekend on my way back from Wollongong I went to bright to the hot rod run and there were five hundred cars beautiful to fifteen hundred hot rods or cars of various types there was everything on display it was a really big meeting the group probably hosted about 5000 people for that weekend and the home Township was buzzing with that said I also remember talking to some of our counterparts from the drag strip in the same weekend that they had the gun National gun titles out at the shooting club they actually had a it was a motorbike do it rally at the drag strip here in Ben 's day which also attracted 600 people as entries so they 've had more than that there probably had about 3,000 people through the gate so the bottom line is these adventure and Co hiding sort of topics are either go at the moment and they 're worth our our council investing in supporting these kinds of events because of the throwback to our communities and what will actually get out of it in in the way of trade for our accommodation places in Abood places so thank you thanks counselor pouts I 'll just touch on a couple of things that you know held the australian victorian off-road championships for the second year in the row which is a motorbike championships where over 250 riders converged on the town and i mean i was only one of six towns nationwide to host these championships and it 's the final round so that have a dinner in the town and everyone gets all their awards and I was lucky enough to wave the flag for that last race so that was pretty cool and the show sponsored that event I attended the Remembrance Day service at 6 creek to commemorate the centenary and the service was really well attended by the community switch Creek Pony Club and like horsemen were on the show and we also had a great speaker from Carrie on Victoria so I 'd like to congratulate the N say switch Creek RSL branch for organising a great service on Monday some of you may have heard that the shower with the Gippsland local Learning Network were successful in securing funding for a university study hub almost six hundred thousand dollars and that 's one of eight towns in a virtual University so it 's a it 's a really big milestone for East Gippsland and will be some fantastic outcomes for our youth and we look forward to that getting up and running next year and lastly I 'd just like to mention that last month we lost a former Emir show councillor and East Gippsland shop councillor bill Flanagan and I would just like to move that a letter of condolence be sent to Bill 's family in recognition of his work and commitment to our region thank you all those in favor Thanks and that concludes our counselor reports okay moving on to officer reports endorsement of north east east and west Gippsland catchment Management Authority regional floodplain strategies miss Nelson today I 'd like to present to Council three regional floodplain strategies each of them has been prepared as an initiative of the Victorian Government and the Victorian floodplain management strategy by the three catchment management authorities that cover it it 's the plan because it as you mentioned the northeast cma which is above the divide back into rivers flowing the other direction and of the regional strategy approach is to really ensure that at a local level we can plan and prioritize the initiatives that are relevant to particular circumstances flooding happens in different ways impacts on communities with each of these strategies Council officers have been involved the development of the plans and as you know council encounters flooding from a number of different perspectives land use planning asset management we have with each of the the plans there 's been extensive engagement with agencies broad range of agencies and also they 've been developed with the request of council today is to endorse each of the plans which means that while the plans develop they contain actions that council will either lead or have so there are there are things in here which are relevant to councils importantly the actions that are contained in each of the documents are things that align with either our business as usual or they just live responsibilities proposing that there 's anything and endorsement of the documents while it 's not a necessary part of the process I think this shows a commitment to working and with appropriate will assist in attracting I think the the regional part is a really effective way to actually plan in a collaborative way to actually and the process of developing those plans a really positive experience and development of really quite significant plans that will help us actually work strategically too so I 'm very happy to present the recommendation today okay thank you I 'll counselor pelts chef question thank you with regards to our previous discussions on this matter I was curious as to whether any outcome has been in regards to the flood monitoring on the Snowy River I think you did say you 'd go and do some work on that and get back to us as to whether that it was included in one of the initial initiative that 's happening right now which has been led by the Department of Environment land planning water it 's a development of an updated flood model for the snowing river that 's not quite complete but will be soon and that will contribute to a number of outcomes emergency management outcomes land-use planning so we farm planning scheme and potential for updated flood warning systems because that the flood warning system does already operate so with regards to that I 'm just wondering then if we adopt this will that what you 've just spoken about being included automatically in the in our commitment to patient well the work is already being done and yes the the strategies recognize that there are a number of floodplain projects being undertaken so there 's work been completed on the Tambo River on Mitchell River and the Snowy River as we speak so there are initiatives that are strategically prioritized by these plans the process for dealing with them will happen as separate processes so so this work highlights that they 're important and that they will be prioritize the results of that council retainer I think you met have met miss Nelson this type of work as we know is critically important for a region like ours and for the benefit of the gallery you 're able to explain briefly the type of engagement activity that you 've had to undertake to help support these strategies I councils will be aware that most of the Shire is actually covered by the East Gippsland catchment Management Authority the West Cape st. ketchup Management Authority intersect with biscuits and Shire only in as far as council land extending from LOX forth so it 's that narrow coastal strip and the Northeast CMA really deal with land benamber so any catchment so the greatest involvement that we have these Gibson catchment Management Authority and the process process that they went through and for issues like flooding where it is something that he 's seen as quite significant amongst agencies regularly experience these events there was significant engagement by agencies and in you know including the Bureau of Meteorology big roads all of the relevant government agencies Council from a number of different perspectives stretch me to remember exactly who was there but there were literally rooms people who contributed to this process and the beauty of the process of looking at flooding on a regional level is because normally you look at we study flooding by looking at each catchment so you don 't get the broader view well how just one I guess point that became really clear through that process was that when you start to look at flooding in the way that it happens in a city plan mostly the river catchments run north-south and the road connections run the major road connection West and while the you know there can be impacts for communities directly from flooding in terms of places being inundated one of the most significant impacts to our community is actually business location and the disconnection that Ben 's dog gets cut off from like breathing and so on all the way providing that that regional context and having all the right players in the room you know quite an insightful process and as a result the priorities but effectively what I 'm saying is I think the priorities thank you is there any further questions we have a recommendation before us do I have a mover madami I 'm happy to move the recommendation before us it 's a critical piece of work we do have one of the best regions in Australia the most livable region in Australia and come come got and the issues around flooding and I commend our staff for their participation in this important piece of work and therefore I support this recommendation thank you thanks counselor tyno counselor I 'm happy to second this I 'd also like to state that work like this actually is a great guideline for our planning department to planning to the future and leave out any issues that may arise from it so strategic work such as this is the base mind for what will come in the future so with that I highly recommend that this be supported thanks counselor pouts any further speakers for any speakers against okay all those in favor thank you thanks miss Johnson okay 5.2.1 planning permit application 30 to 2018 P 550 meeting Road meeting use and development of the land for racing dog keeping thanks mr. hollow mr. Pringle Thank You Madame mayor I 've three or adult it 's men Amir I have co-presenting with me today mr. Robert Pringle he has dealt with this application over many months and he is done some excellent research and chill playing requirements for new requirement contained within these skip sampling scheme messages within the majority of planning schemes within the state of Victoria as you pointed out madam end this is an application for the Houston development of land for dog racing and dog taking it should be noted that the visa application was subject to a planning consulting meeting after it was advertised and received 22 objections the land is at 550 meeting Road meeting which is the northwest of the silver boundary of the township and is own farming zone one the facility is developed with 12 kennels and for day use camels exercises general holding yards and sheds and for various domestic and agricultural uses councils the facility is designed to keep up to 16 racing dogs and Greyhound Racing Victoria will register the dogs as a result of the new requirements the application as I suggested and received 22 objections a planning consulting meeting was held on the 10th of July 2018 and we can recall from that that planning consulted me that there was many concerns raised by objectives in particular regards to noise and disruption particularly in applicant discussed their application with myself and mr. Pringle they determined to amend their application to become consistent or as consistent they could with the planning requirements for racing dog keeping and training we 've assessed their application against those requirements we are of the view that they are consistent with the objectives of the requirements and hence we have suggested a notice of decision to grant a permit to issue today haven 't you take questions amendment thanks mr. hallo any questions counselor Ellis I 'm just having differently bringing up the appendix in relation to barking dogs the requirements for am racing Victoria I 've been approached deepness Restless this weekend about the noise dogs over the evening the night periods you know different different hourly breaks barking and what-have-you now I 'm taking to account this is 100 acre property and the Lord 's been given but to reassure reassure the members of the public can you can you advise me of what council can do if it turns out that the dogs do really create a nuisance Thank You councillor firstly I 'd like to suggest more consistent with the requirements should reduce noise impacts to local residents the kennels will have to be somewhat redeveloped and the idea is to just stop is to prevent the dogs being being woken up or disrupted and therefore barking the kennels are basically reduce that particular influence from external areas and it also then noise attenuated which also reduces the flow and affect other other dogs within the facility should there be consistent and further concerns about barking of dogs there is a process that we can undertake under the local law and indeed that might end up if it can 't_''_3805.07 be resolved in a court for their their view on the manor but I would be confident that we 're going to see a reduced impact I can 't_''_3813.2 say that there would be none but there would be certainly a reduced impact once the facility is redeveloped it is consistent with the requirements councilor pelts um yes mr. Homma with regards to my colleagues question i was curious as to you now in the application whether there has been stipulation of planting of trees as we 've had to put in trees to absorb dust and noise suppression and i 'm curious as to whether something like this has been put on this project Thank You councillor there is a condition with proposed or recommended on the planning permit application and then has been included on those decision to grant a permit for landscaping screening I have a follow up with regards to their actual kennels is their ability to be able to noise proof with regards to the actual soundproofing materials that are used in a home or the likes of a cinema all that kind of thing Thank You counselor pelts there the planning requirements set out different types of construction methods that can be used to achieve the objectives and different basically each type of construction method will achieve the minimum standards that are set out in tan RW writing I can 't remember the specific RW number for for the installation of each component but there 's a component for the walls a component for the ceiling a component for the ventilation shaft all of those have to meet a certain in a domestic situation wouldn 't necessarily be practical it could easily be destroyed if it wasn 't contained properly the construction method that 's been adopted in this circumstance is a thickness of order construction bricks and and that is designed to meet the objectives that have been set um with regards to the previous dog kennel that we had a few years back it 's up water creek the same initiatives were considered as an issue there and and we did stipulate that they needed to plant trees and suppress the noise as much as they could and on driving past I 'm not fully convinced that that has been adhered to and I can 't understand a project like this out in the middle of nowhere the noise does carry across the flats as does you know dust and other things but I was curious as to whether the dogs would be contained internally within an internal lockup area of a night time to suppress the noise that might be thanks counselor so the dogs will we contain within the kennels of an evening we 've also we 've restricted the number of dogs to six day excluding dogs in the three months old for obvious reasons we 've also restricted the feeding exercising of dolls within 500 metres of neighboring dwellings so you must be greater than that and it must only occur between the hours of 00 a.m. 6 p.m. and as I pointed out previously we have a landscape and condition as well obviously restrict the visuals more than necessarily the noise thanks counsel pelts any further questions councils there 's a recommendation before us thanks counselor Tino we 've got a seconder yeah thanks counselor tui speakers for okay yeah its specs speak up or look in moving the recommendation obviously there 's been a lot of work going to this and these issues that can be quite contentious at times but we do have to deal with the facts in relation to this recommendation I 'm happy to leave it madami thanks counsel retainer speakers against councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor I 'd like to speak against the motion please the the application while I appreciate that this application may meet decision to refuse was issued it would likely be overturned by a veto decision that being said and I cannot support this application based on moral grounds further to that the greyhound racing in dasari furthered of that the future of greyhound racing in this country is not clear with a number of states having strong discussion around banning the industry not Jam it not to mention has already been banned by many states and countries abroad despite that my comments are of no reflection on the applicants as I believe they would do everything appropriate to ensure that dogs that kept humanely with greyhound racing tutorial Victoria and council officers ensuring that they meet their street permit requirements however this is a comment on the industry as a whole I 'm aware that we as counselors must work within the existing laws and guidelines and we cannot base our decisions on what may or may not occur in the future but I still cannot support this motion thanks counselor Roberts any further speakers fall against counselor what um yes I realized that under the planning rules and regulations that being rural but my feelings on this is that even though this zone is rural it is adjacent to the town and there are a very large number of Res so we 'll be affected if the if this goes ahead and they cannot suppress the noise and that 's the reason only of same as some councillor Roberts not necessarily against the the people or the proposal it is just my feelings in representing the community I just feel that the the residents who are nearby will be affected so I can 't support thanks counsel what any further speakers right of reply councillor retainer through you madam mayor I rightfully respect the opinions of my colleagues unfortunately we do have to look at this under planning guidelines whether I 've got a personal view or not is that planning guidelines if if as suggested by counsel Roberts that we did refuse this would cost our community to defend the indefensible as far as planning goes so as far as that goes that 's why I 'm supporting his recommendation thank you thanks counselor tyno okay I 've got raise against motion carried okay 5.3 finance report period ending 30 September 2018 thanks mr. Collins thank you madam I 'm Erin counselors this is the first quarterly report for the current financial year and is presented as required under the Local Government Act the appendices will show our you today financial performance as well as our full year expected result the I guess the only significant mattered to report in this first report as you would expect it 's only in the financial year is the impact in the operating statement in the income statement for works that work for which will fund it in the previous financial year for projects that will now be completed in the current financial year so a receive funding last financial year but the projects will not be completed until this year so that 's been taken into account in the forecast to show that reduction in the expected interviewed operating surplus also Timo 's I know there is a further report on on capital works but also the forecast for the capital works and the timing of those capital works picking up the ones that may move into multi-year projects has been taken into account in terms of the forecast end of year result for the capital works program which is always reviewed in conjunction with that projects unit who manage the capital works and major projects so there is a recommendation there and certainly happy to take questions on the report thank you thanks mr.

work of her in the department continually do in supporting our organization I have been in those administration accounting tight roles I know the thankless hours that go into preparing all these reports that look great in summary but I do you understand and sympathize for all the work that that 's going so thank you thanks counselor tonight councillor watt two years to say anything I would just actually like to back up counsel to retain those comments um I think miss Collins you do it you do an believe that you should be commended for this work thank you thanks counselor Wyatt any further speakers all those in favor motion carried thanks miss Collins five point three point to report on audit and Risk Committee meeting held 23rd of October 2018 miss Cashman thank you madam mayor the report before you is a summary of the audit and Risk Committee meeting that was held on the 23rd of October 2018 a full complement was there at that meeting and the quemic points that were addressed at that particular time where the financial management letter for the 2017 2018 external audit was tabled the outstanding recommendations within that report were discussed and noted the first quarterly Raymond Island ferry internal audit report was presented as well which gave a progress update on the actions that were encaptured within that report supporting the recommendations that came from that the exercise the draft procurement policy and procedure for 2018 and the draft public space CCTV policy and code of practice were also tabled at West that feedback was sought from the committee the 2019 reporting regimen of the audit and Risk minor amendments to the tabling of reports for next year a key piece of audit work that was undertaken by Vega and regards to the audit of security and privacy of surveillance technologies in public places report was tabled which counsel was actually one of five or the five councils that were audited by vago apart from those key items all other reports were presented as scheduled and there were no issues that were deemed specific to be referred to Council in any other way shape or form so if there are any other questions I will ask you to thank you thanks councillor Roberts question thank you madam mayor regarding the the public space closed-circuit television surveillance program annual review 2018 report you noted that although there were areas of improvement we did that we were better than the four other councils included in the sample group what were the improvements identified for employed implementation before the end of 1920 there were a number of items I guess in terms of identifying where we sat obviously our dream drone program was a key area of focus for the bago to have a little bit of a look at the interaction between both our council and also the Victorian police in terms of the storage of data and the management of that particular data so there are some some key items that we can actually address there to strengthen the controls around that that capture on that management of that data there was also some work that came out of that in regards to corporate space CCTV as well so that was probably an area of focus that we will be looking on implementing better procedures and policies and signage for instance to to actually have people aware that CCTV is around us and and they will probably make my my main key ones that we thanks councillor Roberts again just like to follow up regarding um data storage was there any specific areas can you note a specific area that needed improvement all it was was that when the audit was actually undertaken it was just a matter of having that data managed and the counselor are aware of how the Victoria Police were actually storing that data and that we had complete faith that there was only a few officers available to actually access and use that data and that it wasn 't you know available throughout their police constituents to be able to access thanks counselor tyno thank you Mr Cashman just as a follow-up from councillor Roberts question I did note with with interest some media hysteria around this particular vago report and even though there was recommendations on how we could do things better can you please confirm that there was no actual breach as car is indicated we came through the audit very well and without employing any crisps we do live in the real world and even in the case of Victoria Police the brick the failure if you like on our governance part was we haven 't been auditing them and we had taken the position that Victoria Police doesn 't need all the tea however they go while respecting the spirit of that thought everybody so we have entered into a respectful discussion but in terms of are we handling data inappropriately or dangerously or irresponsibly absolutely and it 's mainly up to our practices which were very well thanks miss Bennett councillor pouts thank you madam mayor I 'm just as a follow up from that just remind us whether we have a MoU with the Benz dal Victorian police branch regarding in regards to the surveillance security privacy we do have an MoU in place with Victoria police and in fact we wouldn 't have had it is silent on the question of auditing which is why I was there and just a following point I guess it 's to do with this area is still new space for us I mean it 's probably and it 's a growing area in upgrades and reviewing and things like that are always you know recommended in always of importance to make sure things are going along smoothly I suppose miss Bennett I concur with that absolutely we were familiarly into the space and there certainly wasn 't a lot of so these are constantly so I said it 's mainly making sure that thank you there any further questions councillor retainer madam me I 'm happy to move the recommendation speakers for the motion no speakers against I put the motion to you all those in favour question carried thank you five point three point three a Skip 's Shire Council audit and Risk Committee appointment miss Karen thank you madam there so as a segue from the audit and Risk Committee meeting that we 've just previously discussed council maintains an independent audit and Risk Committee in order to help fulfill its governance duties for council and that committee comprises a four external independent members the mayor of the day and two other councillors given that there is one vacant position that has recently come to pass and expiring on the 30th of November and that is the three-year term for our independent committee member miss Christine wrench as part of the procedure to reappoint member expressions of interest in attending the committee were invited to a public submission process for expressions of interests were actually received from well credentialed members of the public and as part of that recruitment process the audit and Risk Committee Chair mr. Michael next even and the CEO mr. Gaffney assess the applications the preferred applicant was identified throughout that throughout that process and I believe that the information and the the credentials of those particular submitters were actually provided to Council under separate cover so with that being said and having advertised that particular committee position I ask that the recommendation be included to be that counseling respect of the vacancy on the East Gippsland Shire Council audit and Risk Committee for 2018 to 2021 that 's the independent external member the mr. jason heylia be appointed for that particular term if there 's any questions I 'm happy to take those thank you thanks miss Cashman any questions councillors all right there 's a motion before us council retainer I 'm happy to move thank you second thanks counselor white speakers all right okay put the motion before you all those in favor against biggest council house 717 okay six motion carried 5.3 point for procurement policy 2018 miss Cushman so the 2018 iteration of the procurement policy has been tabled for your consideration today as part of that annual review that we take which is in accordance with section 186 taken the liberty of stripping out the the procedural content of that particular policy and have formulated a strong management procedure for council of trees to use in their procurement activities in respect to the policy that 's in front of you some of the key items for your consideration that not only have we removed that procedural information we 've taken out any non procurement related sections some of those were falling into the contract management space so we felt that this should be a pure discussion on the key element we have made a commitment to the compliance with the competition in a consumer act which is offering transparency and fair competition to all suppliers to Council we have also improved the clarity regarding the the emergency provisions within the policy and we 've also continued to support local businesses in vying for council contracts by maintaining their 5% waiting within the evaluation criteria which allows us to you know to support those local businesses that contribute to the financial social and environmental well-being of our local region I 'm happy to field any questions on either the thanks mr. Cushman any questions councillors do we have a mover councillor Joey second a councillor pouts speakers thank you madam mayor I 've been very pleased with the the changes that have been made to the procurement policy in the last six or eight months I believe and the fact that we still have that waiting in there for local businesses is good to see so I 'm more than happy to suggest this council thank you thanks counselor we council pouts did you wish just had anything my colleagues coming in and just to clarify the five percent rating for local content is really important and and we do try to look after our local jobs and thanks council post counselor tyno Mehta Mayo I 'm also speaking for the recommendation but in doing so I 'd like to flag that at some point I 'd like to investigate whether there 's an opportunity to look at how we could look after our regional community better with procurement activities based on the our c4 c4 index for disadvantage for East Gippsland and I believe there is a real these factors into consideration when we developing procurement policies and something that I 'd like to certainly champion in conjunction with their with our star thank you thanks counselor tyno good point okay put the motion before you all those in favor motion carried okay five point three point five Municipal Association of Victoria tender for supply of gas and electricity contracts and associated services rft number EC eight three one zero 2019 Thank You mr. Richards thank you madam mayor and council as the current gas supply contract expires on 33rd March 2019 so this items seeking counsel endorsement to participate in an upcoming ma V tender the tenders for a period of up to three years and it 's believed it 's a really cost-effective anklets sorry the collective approach is cost-effective which is important given the annual use is approximately 120 thousand dollars per annum so the recommendation is to participate in the tender I 'm happy to answer any questions thanks mr. Richards any questions do we have a move I can 't split belts please seconder counselor Joey thank you any speakers would just like to be looking after ratepayers funds collectively with with with with some of the other councils I 'm getting the cost-benefit for our community and keeping the costs down so I think government initiative that being said the previous item was more about was more

million dollars which is a significant program great projects that we deliver for our community um that actually represents a hundred and eighty-one discrete projects of which you 'll note from the report a hundred and sixty-five are currently on track eight projects are complete to have been cat sort of moved into will be ready to use and three have been amalgamated into other projects if we look at how we 're tracking will note that of this we have sent we have spent in the first quarter four point seven million dollars and we have committed I fir that fourteen point eight million dollars so collectively that represent some 0.38 of the capital budget so given in the first quarter is really where we start letting a lot of our contracts and have it planted forecasting our work so that 's it 's it 's in a good position for delivery of the capital budget significant is also then and not unexpectedly in the first quarter it 's at there it 's been some movements in budgets as we start to let contracts so you 'll notice in the appendices there have been fifty-one changes some of those are reflecting new projects that we 've got grant funding and the like and some of those are where we 've unpacked large budgets into discrete project budgets so that is not unusual for the first period of the of the year and finally one cranky I 'm one of the things that I 'd like to mention is you 'll notice in in the changes and in the Hawaii we 've presented the information to you we have no what 's called at a capital works holding it out so that makes it very clear very able very easy to track how we 're moving money between budgets so everything that um has an under expenditure goes into the holding account and then when we have budgets that we might require slightly more funding it comes out of the holding account so it gives it 's a very very very transparent tracking mechanism for moving forward and looking at going so that 's a new and they should be um that we have discussed with council previously and I believe that it 's a great initiative just wanted to make note of that but happy to take anything thanks miss well any questions counselor 's counselor Ellis just a topic like Central 's question and that is that I note that the landfill works for the Lakes Entrance land landfill which was to be identified it 's been closed in this current financial year I know just being pushed down into that can you give some reclamation as to why such a large capital works program in excess of a million plus dollars being pushed that 's right with the landfill with the capping of the landfill it has to be designed and then that design has to be approved by the EPA and it 's quite a lengthy process and and what we 've also been looking at making sure that we 're keeping the landfill going for as long as we possibly can to minimize the cost to rate plants and also looking at how we can perhaps cap it in two parts so that we can 't keep a component open while we move towards I 'm setting up the transfer station so which is currently with the EPA for assessment and approval now we can 't start with that capital works project until we have the EPA approval so we will start the project in this financial year but we won 't have it complete so we felt that with them really to flag that nice and early for council so that where everyone 's aware that we will continue to work to deliver that project but it will need to be delivered over two financial years so we have done the word and submitted the application to the EPA who of the oversight of all landfill and we are now awaiting their tick off so what 's your so the designers thing back and forth I understand that it 's now been completed by our consultants for submission by the consultants to EPA so it hasn 't gone um look I 'll take that on notice it 's very close for having gone if it hasn 't already things cancer Alice counts the Robert thank you mister man up madam air [Laughter] it states back to the Lakes Entrance landfill capping the 1819 year budget that 's been carried forward to 9th to 1920 says the unit the amended budget is 1,600,000 and 50 is that on top of the original three million dollar adopted budget or is that inclusive no so what we 've done is pushed half of the budget out it 's just said counselor and once we 've now looking at two years when we have tendered the project and we know exactly how much we was then this year we will then make sure that we 've got the right amount in the right years that flagging nice and early that we 're not going to spend the full budget so as we 're preparing our capital budget for next year we know that we should be identified thanks counselor Pelt Thank You Fiona sorry Fiona with regards to page I 'm on page 7 of the 13 page attachment and I noted that there 's some highlighted red areas and ones cel-3 aggravated wall liner the next ones Milo ramp and jetty works and the next one 's a Jay Freeman drainage design and it canceled and I thought I 'd requested that the Marwan wasn 't wasn 't cancelled that it 's actually suspended for now or delayed and I wasn 't sure what has happened with that because nothing 's changed since our so we 're working on the project budget so the capital budget for next year now so that we can start to develop that and we will look at whether it is been it will be in a future years it 's just about what year it is in so we haven 't_''_5845.38 I did and this stage we have identified it as canceled because we 're not quite sure what year it 'll be going into it probably won 't be into next year 's budget because that one is a joint project with kids ports that we have to work with keeps our imports to put in a joint submission for funding so we 're very relied on when gifts and ports has their funding to put forward towards that project as well so it 's certainly in our planning still but we 're not clear about which a follow up to that question I accept your answer there where do these cancel projects it in regards do they disappear completely because I 'm scared that it will go off the map entirely and all be forgotten about now it 's not on the paperwork and I 'm wondering if there 's a holding cell but for these projects that have been so-called count canceled whether they 're actually cancelled or delayed are two different things to me because at some stage they 're going to appear on our on it in our budget but for them to be canceled to me States the project 's been forgotten about and I 'd hate to see their marlowe rat and Jenny works be taken off that list when it 's in a remote area and they need those works done so offices are already working on a range of projects someone will be put in for next year 's capital works budget some some years afterwards and we have it 's a filing system where all of those are collected and all of those are developed up and scoped like we would for the Marlowe we will be identifying that in the scope of works and officers will be working on those funding requirements and those partnerships in in the forthcoming month so with the with all of our jetties and boardwalks we do try and attract Marine Safety Victoria funding for them as well so we have a list of a prioritized list of projects that are based on the asset condition areas and what the portion or management plan is saying for that area so based on that it will still be in that list prior of high priorities to be budgeted in future with that said I 'll be taking a note of that item number on the left hand side column and making sure when it pops up again that I 'll be keeping an eye out for it thanks counselor parts counselor why did you have a question no counselor Tino if there 's no further questions matter man I 'm happy to move the recommendation you 're doing so I 'd like to think he 's liable having recently studied project management at set now around the project management book of knowledge that 's really quite noticeable in the way we 're getting our reports presented so I thank you for bringing that skill set to the table and yeah are there for support the recommendation and also would like to make the comment counselor Alice alluded to it at our statutory meeting around you know we 've been criticized in the media about having secret meetings and stuff and when you have a look at a 47 million dollar capital expenditure project there 's a lot of commercial in confidence contracts that we have to deal with respectively and therefore that is why we have to close those meetings temporarily so I think council explore are alerting the public to that point thank you thanks counselor retain oh do we have a seconder thanks counselor Roberts any further speakers Paul against the motion to you all those in favor thanks motion carried okay that brings us to the business no urgent other business has been requested Thank You mr. CEO okay that brings us to the confidential section of the meeting I to advise a gallery that the meetings only temporarily closed while we discussed the commercial and confidence nature of things that we 've got to discuss so in doing so I 'd like to move the cow our clothes are meeting to the public in accordance with the previous provisions of section 89 to D and H of the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item 7.1 to 7.8 as these items relate to contractual matters we have a seconder thanks mr. councillor Roberts all those in favor okay question carried thank you _"

Natalie was elected back in 2016 and is the first mayor of the Shire to hell from omiyo me here today thanks Phil you 're welcome to country auntie Doris and I 'd just like to acknowledge the traditional owners on the land in which were gathered here today and I feel really privileged and pleased to have been asked to speak today so thank you for asking me and um you know just humbled to celebrate International Women 's Day with you all so um I 've just been asked to sort of give you a little bit of a background into my life and to where I am at this point so as most of you know I grew up in Ohio so obviously a small community but I never saw growing up there as a challenge or a barrier in fact I saw it as a real asset to my ability to be able to communicate with people because we were socializing with people from all all ages all walks of life from you know the get-go I had a brother and a sister the eight and six years older than me sorry quite a little bit of an age gap I went to I school at keep saying grandma in year nine which was a really difficult time in my life because I 'm a real homebody and moving away from home and my family was quite challenging but I nearly didn 't sort of see it through and my parents asked me to just you know hang in there for a couple of terms and if I didn 't like it after that then you know I could come back so fortunately I stuck it out and stayed there and absolutely loved my time it keeps me and Grandma such an amazing school and made lots of you know lifelong friends and probably where my leadership sort of excelled there was house captain and prefect I played a lot of netball and sport down there you know I 've always been a fairly sporty person and competitive person I suppose so played netball for keeps land and Samoan uni and you know represented the school athletics and different things like that so after high school I left and went to Melbourne Uni and studied agricultural science and during that time I worked part of an example of my competitiveness there they used to have in the tearoom a you know top ten boards for different things and I used to be the top scan rate person so you know I always had that competitive nature I think it was like 25 items pair yeah something like that anyway I finished AG science there and I obtained a job banking in the real finance sector and had to move up to Orange for myself by myself for three months training and then I moved down to Aubrey because a new branch was opening up down there so I did that for a couple of years then decided that I really wanted to go back to uni and become a teacher so I did prep to year 12 teaching course at Latrobe Union Wodonga for a year which was sensational but following I 'd sort of stayed in touch with you know the agricultural industry and then a job came up in the landmark head office in Melbourne to work with the national procurement manager for the AG Kim and seed so I became an husband at the time and then so I stayed there for a year but then always obviously going back home my mum has had been sick for a little bit and then you know she started getting probably progressively Sica so I decided to way like me and my husband decided to move back home to you know be closer to my mum and obviously his family was from I 'm young band style as well and my dad run at the time run a bus business so I wanted to be able to be there to provide a bit of support for him and also to be closer to my mom so I was luckily lucky enough to get a job with Romeo primary school and become a teacher there and Aaron got a job at East Gippsland water and he 's still there now and so during that time we obviously became pretty involved back at the in our community we 're both on you know the footy club I was the prisoner the netball club they just as soon as anyone moves back to town they just committee you can be on this committee that 's what small towns are all like sorry and then we did a bit of travel we went to the US we went to Europe and yeah sorry and just became sort of wholly immersed in the community up there and and just wanting to we loved it we love it there see the benefits and the opportunities and really just wanted to you know promote ano and the area and you know encourage people to sort of move there so we 'd been running a few events different events and one of the events that we 'll had organised was a function for mnd awareness and I was asked to speak just about you know my involvement in the community and at the time someone who was from bands dale who was at the event then said all you should stand for a council and i was like oh no thanks you know i Chloe my youngest was six months and Holly was true sorry you know I was easy enough and anyway he 's quite persistent and then he gave and Joey rang me and said ah you know but he might be interested in less of all I 'm not interested but you know he said I 'll just come along and you know have a mate meeting great and so anyway I ended up going and meeting with Joe and a few of the other people that we all stored together with and ended up standing you know standard standing for council I thought well all this work that we 'd been doing since we 'd been back to Ohio perhaps this was a way to sort of stop whinging and and just do something and get involved so I felt for me you know while now I 'm on here representing a ski plan at the time when I stood it was really because I felt Romeo was underrepresented and since amalgamation we 'd lost a sense of identity and ownership and you know that there 'd been no major sort of money spent in the town and I 'm sure that people who maybe from other areas say all boss mallacoota might have felt the same sorry anyway obviously there was 40 people that stood and I didn 't really think that I would have a chance but later Here I am sorry it 's been a really challenging time but it 's also been like a you know an experience that I 'll never forget and I 've been fortunate that it 's my kids have always been sort of my number one priority but they 've always been coming to meetings with me ever since I 've had them because I 've been involved in you know so many different organizations and and meeting so it was just really a natural extension and they didn 't they 've just grown with me and I 've had such a supportive family and husband so it really has just been you know a great experience sorry up until I guess if we 're talking about International Women 's Day I sort of been involved you know a lot of different industries and you know I 've never seen myself less because I 'm a girl or that I couldn 't do anything because of my gender and I felt like I 've never been treated any differently and probably yeah up until I was elected mayor that 's when it changed sorry it both surprised me and saddened me because I 'd never before but you know in saying that you know there 's lots of other wonderful people and supportive people around us that you know we are breaking down the barriers and you know it 's important that we continue to promote each other and and continue the fight a couple of things that you may not know about me is that breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I 'm a passionate Saint Finn and I 've been to all losing grand finals yet to witness the winning one I play a lot of netball I still play netball I start I play at Wolfram you know growing up near this snow fields I went to ski from the age of four and then turn to snowboarding at the age of nine and when I started snowboarding it was still you know relatively new but yeah so now I still ski 've just started to teach them how to ski so that 's pretty cool I play piano I played piano as a student and I 've just recently sort of fell in love with it again and started to play again I love to read and now that I 'm doing so much traveling that 's transformed into audiobooks and podcasts so I guess in the future I 'm not really sure what what that might look like my term for council finishes next year I think in October so I 've still got my I 'm on maternity leave from my job at teaching at the moment so that 's always in the back of my mind I 'm pretty passionate about education and you know making sure that the standards that we have in our rural and remote areas as high quality as what they are in a city so that 's something that I 've been working on for a long time probably a long term goal would be to go to New York when we went to the States we sort of only went to the New York and maybe work-wise would be as I said I 'm pretty passionate about AFL and 40 I would love to hold a senior in the AFL one day but you know things can change you never know where life can take you but yeah so anyway I 'd just like to thank Vic and the team for organizing a really wonderful event I think it 's important that we continue to celebrate and promote each other and better the balance and that of the world and a saying that someone actually said to me when I became the mayor which I 'd never heard before but I really loved it and I think it 's so true is that you can 't_''_993.209 be what you can 't see and yeah I think it 's just you know raising two two little girls you know I 'm old never I 'm not going to change the way I was raising them because I as I was raised it was that you could do anything you want no matter what but having just you know recently sort of experienced some of opened my eyes up a little bit more but there 's a lot to look forward to so thank you very much [Applause] and now I 'd like to welcome auntie Doris Payton to the stage to be our second guest speaker paper is good I couldn 't print anything off on my printer so I wasn 't told what I could and couldn 't talk about so I just thought I 'd talk about what I want to talk about but I want to reflect about our place in this world from our experiences of life and as original women and particularly my my experience through my family you know I have a resume that 's a mile long and you know that would take me forever to talk about that but you can look me up on the internet and you 'll find out all about me so this title reflects our position as Aboriginal women and shares through the generations the experiences we have of Western society we are bosses ourselves generation to generation so thank you for inviting me to speak this morning I always to this event when I was thinking about the theme better for balance I 'm reminded that my story is only part of a bigger story a greater story a story of generations and it would be remiss of me not to take this so much opportunity to share that story in a world where it 's become important to focus on difference on issues which impact on each other 's lines and where feminism and patriarchy dominate our way of viewing the world and our society in our lives I want to provide a context to this thinking with an Aboriginal cultural insight in Aboriginal society men and women had roles which are known to each other and learned from a very early age these laws and rules provide balance and harmony to these roles me my daughter 's my granddaughters are descendants of matriarchal women was strong in culture who are knowledgeable in their old ways and survivors of historical events genocide and a society that oppressed them as women over generations I 'm privileged to be a keeper of our stories and have responsibilities to share teach strengthened by my great grandmothers my grandmother 's my mother and my auntie 's they 'll show you some pictures there 's a little girl at club Terrace Perry school people talk of being guided and inspired by influences in their lives and I do believe this to be true but in our lives we are guided by our ancestors by our elders and with cultural responsibilities I am particularly inspired by our next generations my mother the lady on the right says that they are our eyes and our footprints for our future as a child we lived our lives around our relatives where they lived and worked the women of our family lived on the riverbanks in the bush and on the fringes of society at the edge of society that was mostly in denial of their existence they raise their children in bar cuts in Humpy 's and our missions where they survived on rations to feed their families subjected to government policies that stole their children separated their families and forced them to live on the fringes they worked as house maids in the rain paddock boxes and in suitcases they maintain their cultural responsibility to teach their children their own language and culture whilst the education system denied them rights as Aboriginal people my mother shares those stories with me she is a keeper of the family stories the missionary wife the women in the wider society and in the positions of influence showed little or no regard for them as women my great-grandmother wrote letters to the board of protection for aboriginals to seek support and did so not only for her family but for many others needing basic food clothing medical and family support the letters are kept in the archives this poignant collective of a time of their life that was ruled by government policies church missionaries and cruel managers there are many stories in collections told about their lives and handed down to the next generations you might say that was a long time ago in a different period in time but I would argue that this time when women in society could have influenced the treatment of our great grandmothers and not contributed to their misery following the rules and family move through the shifting landscape of government policies and forced segregation of our families I grew up knowing that my life was rich in family stories and culture I learnt from this and this shaped my life despite the influence of living in a Western world as a girl as that little girl I love school I love reading I love learning and this continued all my adult life my grandmothers were different in that one grew up on a mission and lived a life under the missionary managers and her life was deeply affected by policies that removed their children and place them in homes and she constantly kept moving to keep her other children so my father remembered how his mother moved away from the welfare and to find work because there was no support again you might argue that this was a time when life was tough and yes living on the fringes as well but my grandmother constant fear of a removal of her children caused her and many other Aboriginal women constant fear my other grandmother grew up living in a strong matriarchal environment they were supported with their children by other women and family members they moved to find work and when I travel around country with my mother she tells me about how they traveled from almost on the train to breathing to pick beings just with their rolled-up bundle with their aunties and the women moved around constantly to find work to support their family but they always lived on the fringes in bark huts and in raggedy old potato sack tents my mother lived his life as a child and as a young woman but unlike the missionary life of the people she speaks her own language she practices her cultural knowledge and shares the stories of their living in seeking work to survive and the stories and knowledge passed from her elders I feel privileged to sit and listen to my mother it 's a greater learning than I could have anywhere else over the last three years I 've learned much about our peoples ways for my mother because she 's getting on so my educated life has been one of learning of understanding cultural connection and to society in many ways I think I 'm still learning from my experience of Western society but I 'm strongly connected to my cultural ways the ways I think behave learn listen speak and mostly live my life this inquisitive child which is me in the front with the ball came from photo from a teacher at club Terrace sent it through on Facebook and I thought that 's me that 's me at club terrace when I was a kid so this inquisitive child was a determined young woman and like Natalie my father told me you can be and do anything you want I had a child at a very early age and I lived and worked to achieve in education a life to empower me to give back to my community my daughter my sons my nieces my nephews and grandchildren have achieved in ways that will change their lives supported by knowing their cultural ways the responsibilities to give to our future generations and as my mother says they will be our footprints in our eyes in this way they will grown into a society and I 've left time to share a cultural way but I 'm not going to do that this morning it 'll take some time so I won 't do that but I just want to reflect briefly on where where education in the Western world has taken me and the education of growing up as an Aboriginal girl to being an Aboriginal woman I lived in Gippsland all my life I grew up in kanne River Club Terrace came to be and I went to high school here move down the valley went to the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education did several degrees either online or through going to uni I went to South Australia uni to do a masters I went to RMIT didn 't complete my PhD so I 've been around in all different unis but my best learning in life has come from my family my learning about Who I am how I belong what this country means how I 'm connected and what it means for our future and for our kids in our community I would like to see that the cultural learning of else tried to do through it curriculum through working with schools and continue to do that so that our kids and kids from the wider community and teachers and the broader community learn about our ways our knowledge so that they can contribute to that a world where my unlike my mother grew up in and unlike the women of our community grew up in I want to make sure that I make sure they have a world to live in that acknowledges their originality and acknowledges that they contribute to this world in a way that we are connected so thank you very much [Applause] Thank You Annie Doris it now gives me great pleasure to introduce our final presenter for today dr. Bethany Roberts who is the new chief assistant Fire Officer for Delp in Gippsland Bethany has worked across the department for nine years in senior roles she holds a PhD in climate ecology and believes in people first leadership I 'd also like to say a special thanks to Beth today for being here as you 'd appreciate the BET 's team 's been working incredibly the fires that are ravaging so thank you both for being showing your commitment to be here with us today Wow it 's a lot of people here thanks so much there for that really nice welcome it 's pleasure to be here today and thanks to Natalie and I need Doris for really generous stories it 's through that really personal generous story that we get to learn so much so thank you I 'd actually like to start today with a bit of a story about my mum my mum is sitting here and I thought I was not gonna lose it but I probably will anyway um so my mom is a teacher and later in life a principal and this story really begins in the mid 1960s when mum was graduating from Teachers College and she tells me a story about how you know towards the end of her degree there are a series of seminars organized on superannuation and all the men in her class were invited and none of the women so my mum marched up and said well why not and the faculty a teacher is likely going to be in rural South Australia and you 'll likely meet and marry a rich farmer and probably won 't need to worry about super will you mum went along anyway of course and then started carving out her career as a teacher the flexible work arrangements that we enjoy now as women in the workplace was simply not an option for mum and the legal requirements around what she needed to do were very very different so when mum was married and again when she left to go on maternity leave she was actually required each time to resign her permanent role and each time that resignation left we all the perks like being able to apply for senior management roles so every time mum would return to the workplace as a temporary employee and begin to work her way back up through the letter again eventually mum made her way to being a principal in some of South Australia 's toughest primary schools and I can tell you she probably ruled them with an iron fist just like she did at home see also very fair and she tells me stories about how she went to principal engagements along with all of her colleagues who were all men and found a very we called at the start to really push boundaries about new ideas to how to educate the kids and bring innovation into the education department but she carried on and she talks about how she brought a philosophy to her school around the teacher was really there to provide the best possible education for the kids regardless of their socio-economic background and by the end of mums career she said that 's the legacy she left behind in that old guard who really moved on my mom tells that story with a fair amount of pride and I wanted to tell it today because I think it 's really important for us to celebrate just how far we have come in one single generation it 's not that long ago and sure there are still challenges and I 've had my fair share as well but I 've never really been subjected to that sort of blatant and probably unconscious bias the reason that I wanted to come here and speak today is because this has become more acute for me as I watch my own two daughters grow up talk about who they are what they want to do and how they want to get there so that 's why it 's a real privilege for me to be able to speak and continue to push those boundaries for that generation coming behind us so back to me I 'm the assistant chief fire officer forget Flanders Sarah mentioned and basically this means that I have land management oversight for a really large area of Gippsland from wilson 's prom right through to can Reverend Ben dock on the New South Wales border at the moment I have about 400 staff that I have duty of care for including our firefighters which you would have read a lot about in the most recent weeks but we 're not just firefighters we also take care of the land we 're stewards of the land we build tracks and trails and even roads and recreation sites for people to enjoy our great planners gos officers wildlife officers cultural heritage experts and of course we work in conjunction with all of our other land managers some of whom are here today and a fair amount of what we do is working with the community because essentially that is what we are here to do so you could say that my role comes with a large amount of accountability and I have to say that probably the prerequisite for it is being able to have an appetite for risk because there is a lot of it and it happens every single day but I absolutely love my job the one question I get asked though when I tell people about what I do is how do you balance that with raising young family and sometimes that question gets even more pointed to do you think you can sustain that and my answer to that is hell yes I do think I can sustain that and that is because I am really clear about what my job is you see I don 't see myself as the firefighter I 'm not the GOS person the 'm the leader of this organization in Gippsland and with that means that I have to actually lead my people and make sure that not only are we delivering on the accountabilities of the Victorian government but we are continually fighting this really fine balance behind protecting life and property with from bushfire and other risks and also enhancing and valuing the environmental values and assets that we have here and that 's a really tricky leadership balance but by being absolutely clear on it is how I find my balance so I wanted to talk to you today about balance for better in the context of leadership that 's my family let 's talk about what leadership actually is if you google it there 's about 800 million answers to this question what is leadership and over the last 20 years I 've been able to practice a lot of them through trial and a fair amount of error getting there and I don 't have time to obviously go through everything today that I have learned but what I 've distilled it down to is what I call that I keep really close to myself they align really strongly with my integrity and my values and keep reminding me every day about the leader that I know I want to be so the first key is self-awareness I love this photo self-awareness obviously it 's about knowing who you are and knowing what perception you give off because sometimes the perception you 're giving other people is something that they don 't really like to me this comes down to communication and being really aware about how you communicate as a leader because every day you 're in communications where you need to influence a negotiate for the best outcome for the organization you work for and that 's not about pushing your point and about pushing your baro it 's about really understanding how the person opposite you communicates and adjusting your own style to get the best from that interaction and that takes a huge amount of self-awareness at the end of the day you don 't want to end up in backyard politics moving on from that really is being aware enough about what your you with complementary strengths this photo is my under 11 hockey team that I coached last year and I put it up there because we do this really well in sports we bring together teams that have amazing sets of complementary skills you never see a football side fielding 4 forwards but we do this all the time in business and I 've got to tell you that I fell into the trap really early on in my career I hide people just like me you know that were really easy to get along with we had a great time we had the same vision we knew where we were going and you know it was really just an easy way to get work done but if I 'm really honest with myself they 'll probably not the most productive teams they 'll probably not the teams that push the boundaries the most northern most efficient so to me powering up the best team around you is a really important skill as a leader authenticity authentic leadership is something that gets talked about a lot now you might remember remember a young Democrat in the early 90s since she rocked up to Federal Parliament in her Doc Marten boots because that 's what you wore when you were 20 in the 90s she went on to say that there was more discussion in those early days about her Footwear than her policies but she was uncompromising about it and to me that 's an authenticity doesn 't matter what your political persuasion is but being authentic to who you are and holding your attacker II the whole way through no matter what people say is truly important because authenticity is will get you trust and credibility you will be the leader standing at the front and there 's times where you do want your team to follow you over the trench and the only way that happens is that is if you 've built trust and credibility with them in the industry that I work in in credibility often comes with what you 're wearing shoulders or how many decades you 've been in the business and because I had neither of those prior to this job that 's really was meaning what I say and doing what I say and that time where if one of my people to follow me over the Treach has come in the last few weeks but they have and finally this is probably my favorite key is about leadership is not about you gotta leave your ego at the door it 's about the people who are around you and following you because they often have fabulous ideas I don 't have time to show you a youtube clip but there 's a really neat three-minute video around the power of followership which I really encourage you to have a bit of a look at but finding another and finding and following other people 's good ideas I have found as it is an amazing key to building great leadership and this is no more important than when you 're talking about change management and we would have all been this through this before with machinery of government restructures continuous change in our organizations change is only successful as a leader when you 've got followers coming behind you and the theorists talk of you as if you 're drawing it on a piece of paper we put your pen down to the paper is the current state of being and as you go through time and through change management as a leader it can really feel like you 're taking steps backwards morale is dropping it becomes really difficult to continue to push that change and then there 's like a moment where the switch almost flicks you 're at the bottom of the U and it starts to come up the other side momentum is building people are jumping on board with the vision and you get to that final state of being and that 's where you lift your pen off the paper that can 't happen without followers you 'll get your early adopters that jump on straight away from the current state of where it 's being to where you want it to be but most people take their time and that change management can take in my experience years so it takes a lot of fortitude but it can 't happen if you don 't follow other important to me perhaps the thing that binds all of these things together so you can think about it as a metaphorical keyring for me has been the most challenging but probably the most critical and that is vulnerability just wanted to let that word hang in the air vulnerability because we don 't talk about it and we should talk about it because being vulnerable and showing your people that you are vulnerable is the best way to get successful leadership that I have found in most recent years because it encourages them also to show vulnerability and therefore build their own leadership skills Brenna Browne is a social researcher in the US and she 's written a couple of fabulous books one called daring greatly if you 're more of a visual person then jump online and watch her TED talk about the power of vulnerability and Bernie says that through the tens of thousands of pieces of dialogue that she 's collected by talking to people about what 's at the core of vulnerability is that at that core are things like joy connection creativity and innovation leaders so she says that by arming yourself up against vulnerability and if you 're anything like me you do that all the time because often it can be seen as a sign of weakness but if you 're putting your armor on against that vulnerability you 're actually cutting yourself off from all those amazing characteristics so what I 've really tried to work on the last couple of years is acknowledging and being proud of my vulnerability because it 's pretty courageous to do that I don 't know if you 've ever suffered from imposter syndrome when you 're sitting at the table you 've actually got an influence or seen at the table for the first time so it 's actually going on around you and he 's thinking in your mind oh my god when are they gonna find out I don 't know what I 'm doing it 's okay we all do it and we all do it every single day but acknowledging that vulnerability is truly something courageous so what I wanted to say to you is be brave be brave enough I don 't know let 's figure that out together be brave enough to be that person that says that is a great idea it 's a better idea you let 's do that because that bravery is essentially that bravery is essentially what is going to create the best leader that you can be finally because it 's International Women 's Day I wanted to come back to this point in a minute I 'll show you a clip that to me has a really powerful message for a day like today but coming back to what I was originally saying finding your balance for me is about finding your leadership style so find it be it be proud of it embrace it and lead just like a girl would lead show me what it looks like to run like a girl show me what it looks like to fight like a dog now throw like a girl so do you think you just insulted your sister no I mean yeah insulted girls but not my sister my name is Dakota and I 'm 10 years old show me like a girl fight like a girl what does it mean to you when I say run like a girl you mean we 're fast as you can please join me in welcoming Beth that was absolutely fantastic I promised myself I wouldn 't cry and I 'm crying again Wow I think for today we 're celebrating women 's achievements and that Doris Beth Wow three local women inspirational thank you so much to the three of you I think another round of applause for had regrets presenters please yeah look I 'll reiterate that wasn 't that special and I think that the theme today really when we 're looking at balance for better and the celebration that we had is is the role modeling and the teaching and and doesn 't matter where that teachings come from but I think we 're all here today celebrating and we can we can learn a lot from or just heard from those three ladies today so in closing I 'd like to thank Elbert Co for the sensational food there 's more out there if you 'd like to this spectacular event they 're promised winks next year Thomas for his fantastic eyes hey skills and pulling this all together the MOU HR group for helping pull all of this together today it 's been quite a bit of work all the organizations in the room have supported the celebration and having us here today but most importantly all of you all of you for coming and taking critical time out of your days to celebrate this really really special day so thank you we will send out a survey as well so we can get your feedback on and what you thought about the events so we can do something even better for next year so look out for that survey link and thank you all very much for coming and have a wonderful day _"

outstanding community event held in East Gippsland Shire during the past year I 'd like to congratulate the organizers of the kin river volunteer Appreciation Day a little bit about volunteer appreciation day as they make their way it 's election in April 2009 the inaugural can revive aunty Appreciation Day was held recognizing yet standing contribution community members make to service in the can River community organizations and groups represented included the community center bush nursing service land care SES CFA kindergarten and the school which is a Peter 12 the event had a strengths-based focus on positive and pro-social behavior of community members and emphasized and demonstrated interagency collaboration and cooperation a three-course meal catered by five local food businesses live music and a jumping castle for the children made for a great salad certificates recognizing service to the community were presented to 102 worthy volunteers the event was organized by the can River Community Center congratulations I did actually bring a little bit Society our volunteer day celebration was a group effort so we have a lot of people to thank we 've got to thank the East Gippsland Shara 's Council for sponsoring the event through the Community Grants program thank all the local can River businesses for contributing to the meal was amazing and thanks to all the other kin river agencies the head stalls and helped us put together the guest list the bush nurse yes CFA SES ambulance land care etc etc and of course enormous thanks to all the volunteers of the Cane River Community Center who make our existence possible as well as our programs and events actually this particular event was unique in that as a thank you to all our volunteers we didn 't often actually work on the night and that presented some real challenges because then our two paid staff members had to do what usually 10 or 20 volunteers would be doing so it really showed the hard work they put in it also on the other challenge is getting the volunteers to not work trying to get them to sit down and be recognized and celebrated they kept wanting to cook or decorate the hall or wash the dishes even though the event was catered and paid for they more than one insisted on bringing a plate so there 's no denying Ken Rivers been facing some tough times since the had to entirely reinvent our local economy which is no small feat for a small town of about 200 people an hour 's drive to the nearest hardware store but Ken river is not a town to be pitied we are a community to be envied we are a community of resourceful hard-working talented people who put in time and effort not just for ourselves or our families excuse me but for our neighbors for the next generation and for the elderly even for the passing traveller in can River people find a way to provide for each other the kind of goods and services that residents of bigger towns take for granted in addition to our own work commitments our families are studying personal aids we contribute to the communities emergency services health services education services transport services we mow the cemeteries lawns and the Kinder 's we drive each other to bigger centers for medical appointments we cook each other meals we teach each other what we know we protect each other in emergencies we find a change of clothes and a bed for the stranded traveler we to or because it 's our job well because there will be a reward but just because that 's how it gets done when the community center decided we had to celebrate national volunteer appreciation recognized a community spirit spoke to every committee and organization in town and by the time we 'd finish putting the list together with 70% of the town 's adult population on the list we 're very proud to accept the award for celebrating the amazing volunteers of cam River their community spirit hard work and talent give us every confidence our town is a bright future coming just around the corner congratulations took the can River community and volunteers and Suzie thank you for those words an explanation of the story behind it in another life I used to coordinate a community neighborhood house so I know how passionate people are about those centers and that the incredible impact they can have on communities so congratulations to your well done let 's put our hands together again soon that gives me pleasure now to hand the microphone over to Tim ball out the member NAT and councillor pelts and also our former mayor and council a Brenda it 's greatness to you we have Brenda once again ladies and gentlemen I 'll be relatively brief but I 'll just make a couple of comments on our recipient it 's today I think the not that it 's a criteria in selecting those what 's but it 's great to have winners of two of the three categories from some of our smaller communities in Far East Gippsland so I know that June for a long time has been very very passionate about all things mallacoota and and june listening to natalie talk about the things that you 've done in your community are you very typical of why a lot of our rural communities function they simply wouldn 't function without viet without the efforts of volunteers across the board so without detracting from you being a very very worthy winner i think what is a compliment to you is that you 're pretty much a classic example of what is good about a country Victoria what is good about country who skips land do a lot in a lot of different spaces because you enjoy doing it and because it gives back to the community in which you live so full credit to you and I wish you all the best in being a citizen of the year for the next 12 months and I think it 's fantastic that how citizen of the year is from mallacoota that you may be the first citizen of the year from Ella cooter I 'm not sure but that 's fantastic to tauren I think one of the things in reading your or the application that was put in on your behalf was there was a lot of examples here where you 're a great role model and I think for a younger generation they probably don 't understand or recognize or realize the importance of being a good role model amongst your peers and in your community we have a lot of kids that perhaps don 't have is fortunate upbringing as many others so to have young people in the community that others around your age can aspire to be like because you it 's really really important so again all the best for the next 12 months ahead and I 'm sure you do a great a great job in the role can River Community Center as we have discussed in the past does a lot on a little budget and what what the Community Center has won the award for today is just one thing of a very very large number of programs and activities that it has oversight of in the cannery of a community and as you quite rightly pointed out canna river hasn 't been without its challenges with the with the downturn in the timber industry sector but I think as a stopover point for people who are traveling to mallacoota or Marin Bueller or Eden or wherever on holidays can rivers really done a great job of reinventing itself and who 'd have thought that there would be so many coffee shops and bakeries along the Main Street there in can river 15 20 years ago so it has done a great job and is a great example to a lot of other communities about how itself and be successful into the future so to all of our winners congratulations I hope you have a fantastic Australia Day on Saturday or ever you 're spending it I will hopefully be in Lakes Entrance for quick brekkie in the morning and then back into being style for the ceremony that 's going to kick off at about 9 o 'clock I think he 's on Saturday so if you 're in town here please try try and make your way down jus no doubt you 'll be in mallacoota and be the toast of the town I 'm sure but to everyone have a great Australia Day spend it with your family spend it with your friends and just remember we 're in a pretty tough time at the moment with the lack of rain a lot of people doing it really hard so Australia is a good time to get people together get them talking I guess give people a bit of comfort it 's an opportunity to give people a bit of comfort and get them socialising we will see this through we 've been side of it but in the meantime we just got to look out for each other until we do to get through it so thanks for the opportunity to say a few words and congratulations not only to our winners but to all the nominees as well it 's a credit to you to be nominated for the award also thank you [Applause] thank you Tim very true true words spoken can I just again congratulate the the winners June Turin and the volunteer appreciation can River well done to you all I think it 's really important at this point to remember that the the nominators are so important in this process I know you know we do focus on the people that win but if people aren 't nominated it 's very difficult to have winners so I encourage you to go away from here as well everyone and and remember and remind people that it 's it 's it 's a good way of recognizing those people in the community and we did have a good number of and nominees nominations this year so it was really happening in the community so can I probably just wrap things up there thank you everyone for attending the there will be some light refreshments are they yes they 're over here so please join us for some light refreshments thank you again there will be some photos and I 'm sure the communication staff will direct people in in in that but don 't be afraid as nobody is these days to take a photo and or ask for someone to be in a photo with you so

Kiir mr. Morris bug out would you please come and raise your question yeah two questions when was the legal advice received that counsel had relied on to run the life sentence Christmas carnival without a planting permit and not under the good neighbor code of practice for a circus or carnival for including the carnival in the late center of summer festival event resistant eyes affected neighbors and public any avenue to object how can this be seen as a fair go mister fear met a mirror I 'll refer this to mr. Holton quite simply he was the legal advice you could say it 's a rhetorical question if anything so so is that hoping for a answer I think he 's answered the question mr. Berger out can you please move on to your next question [Music] I 'm believe it 's a rhetorical question yes okay not happy anyway joy the next one mic sentence carnival decision considering counselors stated that the piao tender for the Lakes Entrance Christmas carnival was being run well in advance to ensure potential proponents sufficient time to plan and prepare for the delivery of the of the carnival and noting that the PIO submissions closed four and a half months ago on the 19 September 2018 why is it taking so long to make a decision question 1 which council meeting is a decision expected happy to advise that a decision has been made and that the contract for the delivery of the carnival as part of the lake sanction summer foreshore festival has been awarded to chance amusement under delegation by the CEO okay that 's the last bit of the question with all due respect I believe I 've answered the question in its entirety Thank You mr. bourdelle I 'm speechless dr. Shannon Woodcock could you please come and ask your question good evening we are hundreds of people against the violation of done I cannae country for the hundreds of people which are hundreds more than the mining company has here tonight I 'm just curious about that let 's just say yeah through you mad at me that 's not quite what the question was as it was written however again it 's not a question that I can I can answer tonight from the floor there 's part of the debate tonight is around council 's decision in this matter and I feel that that will be that will come to light as the debate occurs thank you very much thank you mrs. Jeanette Wagner thank you madam mayor my question is when the notice of rescission was launched on the 13th of December why wasn 't a date for a special meeting to hear that notice immediately scheduled after it was requested by councillor Roberts and question two and why would the mayor councils tui Reeves and pelts available to attend a special meeting proposed for the 19th of December resulting in a quorum not being met and councillor Roberts having to withdraw his request leaving the appearance that their unavailability was a deliberate act madam chair there were certainly very tight timeframes at that time of the year with the Christmas in new year period and an availability of councillors there was a councillor discussion in relation to this matter ultimately councillor Roberts withdrew his special meeting request and as such the quorum doesn 't part of the question in the second part doesn 't apply because there was actually no meeting held where a quorum was it wasn 't present what I would say as well is I can 't speak on behalf of the councillors that you mentioned in your question that 's something for them they had advised that they weren 't available and that is their right to do so thank you miss Janice grenfell in relation to council resolution number three to 2018 and freedom information request that has been made whether any written communications from the East Gippsland Shire Council CEO or written communications prepared and or sent on his behalf center in the period 00 p.m. on Tuesday the 11th of December 2018 J p.m. on Thursday 13th of December 2018 2 1 the Honorable Daniel Andrews Honorable Tim ball MP which touch concern for otherwise referred to resolution number 3 2018 passed at the council meeting on 11th of December 2018 and whether any responses were never received to those written communications Thank You mr. Sayre through you madam chair a formal Freedom of Information request has been submitted exactly as has been read there it would be inappropriate for me to speak to that when a formal process has been requested through a different channel I would refer to miss Bennett if she has a different view but um I believe that a formal process has commenced and it would be inappropriate to comment thank you suddenly that amendment I asked miss Bennett where where that opinion comes from the basis of what is a reasonable question not being addressed how the FI foi application impacts upon this citizens question I would be remiss no sorry I would be reluctant to provide a response to that question yeah given that it hasn 't the FOI request has only recently been received and hasn 't as yet been researched so while the CEO may be able I would prefer that the facts are established and properly documented rather than having to thank you Miss Bennett Joanne miss joy and Eastman does Amir or do any of the counselors have any direct or indirect conflicts of interest including indirect conflict by close association that is family members or close friends with the direct or indirect interest concerning the finger bullets my proposal including any shareholdings or options held directly or indirectly in Kalpa resources our council is aware second section second part our council is aware that under Section 173 of the Corporations Act public companies whether listed or unlisted must provide their share register for inspection within seven days of request and that the register will include the details of shareholdings including the contact person for corporate shareholdings as well as the history of all share transactions including those all purchased and sold needs to see you through you madam chair and the Local Government Act is very clear in relation to councilors responsibilities around conflicts of interest and it very much puts the responsibility to the individual councillors to declare if they believe they have to that or not I think a lot of this goes down to perceptions and what the reasonable man might think in the court of law anyway Thank You mr. Gregg mace I hate to say I read it on behalf thank you Greek mace 175 band-style Darko Road ban style the question reads councillor ratinho associated with your job with federation training as partnership broker keep stone resilience strategy have you had any involvement of any kind or are you aware of any upscaling program at full and Correctional Center to assist inmates on release from jail to gain employment with the proponent mineral sands mining company should their mind be approved to proceed can counsel arresting ratinho advise if you had any employment or made any application for employment or undertook any consulting work for cowboy resources between 2016 and 2019 I would go back to the answer that I just previously gave in terms of conflicts of interest the counselors are required to please refrain from shouting at mr. CEO I 'm happy to answer that both those questions the quick the answer is no and no 1.8 record of assemblies of counselors December 2018 January 2019 thanks counselor poets do we have a seconder thanks counselor Chui all those in favor machine carried okay notices of motion or rescission we have a number of people who have requested to speak to this agenda item you can you 'll see the timer up on to the left of me so the first person to speak is Miss Chloe Wagner if you would like to come sure if it 's Debbie Carruthers speaking if I could say just to support the comments that you made tonight that in asking everybody here to respect the counselors here and not to heckle and to make any comments and so that we 'll have a smooth-running meeting and we would also appreciate that we were unaware that the timeline would be restricted to three minutes for speaking and in the guidelines it specifically states that five minutes is is available for people and I think that in being fair to the speakers I 'm assuming people have prepared on our side are the four against the motion to be able to and I respectfully asked if those speakers could be provided with the five minute time frame and that people will respect the five minutes and not speak any longer than that it 's actually up to five minutes or at the discretion of the chair but people would have come prepared thinking it could be five minutes because that 's what it has been in the past in the past it could have varied at any time so given the number of speakers respectfully we have other business to attend to tonight as well so we I have made it known that it will be three minutes so that 's however not known to people who were submitting and they 're prepared and I 've come on an expectation of being able to speak for up to three up to five minutes madam chair respectfully to ask you that question because this is about hearing from the community and both sides of the debate and to give everyone a fair chance to come and speak in five minutes is quite a short time period and with respect everyone will be and hopefully that will save some additional time thank you and I respect your comments but I will leave it at three minutes thank you madam me might may I speak thank you miss amantha Thank You me scrubbers I 'm chairing this meeting please I would ask you to be respectful [Music] miss Chloe Wagner can you please come and speak thank you miss Wagner thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is Chloe and I 'm 15 years old I always called East Gippsland home I can 't throw it for another three years but by then we 'll be too late I am speaking on behalf of all those who can 't voice their opinion the decision made now all impact on the future my future and my children 's future and can we possibly envision my grandchildren 's future my family and I enjoy the outdoors swimming kayaking and upper water focused activities in our lakes and rivers but I worry that it won 't be safe to continue to enjoy those things for myself and many other people I am NOT against mining of the location of the mine I love animals and plants who is the voice for our native animals and fish to protect them potential harm to our aquatic life which in turn affects the fishing and tourism industries things that I worry about we have a large dam on our property and I can see what impact the drought is having as the dam is nearly empty and has been since last April we need to protect water because it is important to all life in the current drought conditions make it more concerning I have heard that the mining use a lot of water to run that is a stupid use of our precious water which should be kept for more important things like growing food and drinking safe and clean water is our basic human right I am angry and upset that your original decision could be stopped and I don 't understand why you are not listening to us the concerns of our community must be listened to we want you to consider the fact that you are taking again with the future of the younger a mining State thank you for your time mr. Charles Beckett mr. Charles Beckett thank you for the opportunity to speak when people are voted into elected office the very first thing they say is I 'm humbled to be of service to you the people councillor Roberts motion that was passed was about listening to the concerns of the community and taking action to let decision makers know they should be serving the people who elected them if one examines the rationale the decision motion with respect to clarity of the December decision I would have thought it is the role of the mayor and the CEO to ensure there was clarity before the vote was taken there are nearly hundreds of studies and statutory papers written about the region between Dargo and a ninety Mile Beach they all have one thing in common the sensitivity of this region in about 2010 the Lynda Novelli was becoming more intense with human habitation and agriculture activity in April 200 2011 the council commissioned a report to review the East Gippsland planning scheme called the Linda doubt zone and overlay review go back to the snowy mountains the strategy is to ensure that high quality agricultural land and the Mitchell River floodplain is protected from an appropriate development the policy required that dwellings will generally need a planning permit to minimize the impact of non agricultural uses on valuable land it is so reassuring to see the council protecting our valuable agricultural assets from somebody building a home many people many papers have been written on dams developed in dispersive soils some papers not even recommend a water storage them being built on such saws Linna 60 hectare taming down do we mention banana or even Brazil there are hundreds of studies dear madam counsellors the proposed open-cut mineral sands mine does not seem to comply with your planning policy the EES process is flawed and a high proportion of your constituents are against the proposal I would like to draw on the council 's attention to the Rhine Council plan 2017 I 1 on page 6 where it states the role of the council is to protect a community making sure the environment is safe and plain prevent things that pollution represent the needs and desires of local and wider community fostering community cohesion thank you mr. Beckett as embarrassed as ambassadors you are obliged to advocate on behalf of the reader people all thousands of us you must fight against this most emotional restitution thank you you miss Joann Eastman with apologies because I thought that we had five minutes to speak so it 's quite difficult trying to work out what the most important things to say are as I said in the last time respect to counsel my family 's affected by this mind having a property right next door and one on the other side of it and it 's going to have massive impacts on us with that in mind we have to make a lot of hard decisions and given that two years ago I wrote to quell by requesting that I see a copy of their share register which is my right under Section 173 of the Corporations Act it took a lot of chewing and stroke throwing before caliber finally gave me a modified copy of the register in which they only 20% of the shares another lot of chewing and frying meant that they gave me a a copy that I was able to access while I wasn 't able to access it I was able to see it on a computer screen in a lawyer 's office without being able to search it they completely breached the Corporations Act when they did that we need to make decisions based on what we know about who 's behind this mine and whether there 's any substance to them we don 't even know whether people there have got the funds if anything goes wrong so given that it really surprised me last Friday well sorry I 'll go back a bit when I did say that copy in the lawyer 's office I wasn 't allowed to take notes I wasn 't allowed to do anything but fortunately I did remember two names that stood out one because of an address and one because it was a really unusual company name I accessed as he gone line to search that company and was able to find out that it actually belonged very closely associated with others who were pushing the mossy face mine and who were making people 's lives at miserable if they were opposed to the mind so once again this is the type of thing that I 'm concerned about the influence that 's being used and then I see these same people writing to the paper last week about people needing to wait for a DSS to come through before they make decisions but these same people two years ago and probably even before they 're invested in a company without knowing what was about so telling us to wait for factual stuff but then hoping to god that they 're going to make an absolute killing of this mine goes ahead I 'm asking you to consider that when a public company remains owned listed they do it because they are trying to get people to invest who they know can influence decision makers they handpick for shareholders and they will not list publicly until they 've got the people in place and they 've got in place what they want it 's a well-known strategy can access share registers and find out what 's going on I 'm particularly interested in knowing who calibre has approached and what influence they 've used over the time and I think everyone in this room should be because it will relate to counselors and council staff and I think the community has the right to know what 's behind this push for something that is so obscene and inappropriate thank you mister [Applause] mr. Victor heater my name is dr. Victor Hugo and the chief executive officer for care of our resources but they 're not intend in this statement to argue the merits of the fingerboards mineral science project the assessment of this project will be undertaken by the Victorian Government Minister for planning in accordance with environmental effects Act and the years process currently underway in accordance with this act there 's a statutory process involving the submission and assessment of technical evidence independent review and ministerial assessment and it 's informed by the community informed by community input through a public consultation process the rationale for the resentment motion or recession of motion before council meeting of the length of of December 2018 lacked clarity and direction for officers to be able to implement any specific resolution or outcome and Calabar agrees with this rationale I would also state that until the EES is completed and assessed by the community and has had the opportunity the community has the opportunity to respond all submissions made by Council to members of parliament regarding the impacts of the project or the views of the community will be based on the information that is incomplete or unreliable as far as we are aware council has not sought the advice of technical experts conducting the EES or formally received any risk assistance or are they evidence regarding with potential impacts of the project on the East Gippsland economy society environment well whether those impacts can be adequately managed I would also submit that council to our knowledge has conducted no formal consultation with the East Gippsland community to determine the views of the whole community about the project please don 't pull out for these reasons the resolution of council passed on the length of December 2018 it is be rescinded councilors are aware of the obligations under the Local Government Act and I do not intend to spell out these in detail what I would say is that in undertaking these obligations Council is required to make decisions based on complete and factually accurate information and to take all necessary steps to verify the accuracy of the information to observe due process and the legislation of the state of Victoria and to properly consult and act in the interests of the entire Gippsland community we 're not asking councillors to support the project we 're asking you to exercise your duties and obligations in the inference of good governance we strongly encourage you to allow the statutory process to run its course evaluate the evidence and properly investigate and consider the expressed views of the whole community before the advocated position Thank You mr. Higa thank you miss Pamela Parker good evening I 'm reading this on behalf of Pam Parker I have to abbreviate it it 's a hater store Mike can you just let me know what your name is sorry sorry what 's your name trust the environmental organization registry the Australian Government and committed to the sustainable use of Natural Resources respirator farming and conservation Strathfield estate offers a good public agricultural research and a mission following from the bequest of dr.

Allen Solomon does someone have a device in the audience that can be turned off so sorry [Music] Thank You mr. Solomon last year I spoke about if you speak in the words of acknowledgment that you need to respect the words also mentioned about massacres sites that happened in the area that hundreds of remains was found gold ochre no peoples traveled to different areas of Victoria following the seasons or food source there is numbers of camp areas throughout Glen Allerdale and still today you can find the artifacts I was just going to use the example now if that was our australian Anzacs and the capybaras was our diggers setting up camp and waiting for the enemy enemy to come or them scarred trees were bullet holes the artifacts were bullet shells bomb shells and and everyone would know that story and that that history cause has been that 's the history how how do you feel the mining company yourself got to sit in front of the Shire Council arts and please don 't destroy our history here tell our in this room we all want to be acknowledged and we respect on our feelings what I want you to do is to do the right thing for people in the community that 's everyone that 's what I got to say I mean Astrid Rose and I believe Don Rita reef Minh is reading on her behalf tonight our mayor and councillors will be making the decision whether to rescind the motion table by councillor Roberts at the December 2018 council meeting before they make their determination I would like to take the opportunity to remind them of a recent rejection of the development of a large 5-star luxury resort proposal for Apollo Bay at first tight side it may seem that comparing the process involved in an approval for a luxury five-star resort to that of an open cuts and mineral sands mine is rather like comparing apples to oranges however there are many aspects of the decisions and responsibilities of the cola godwe council faced when Gippsland shy councillors now face in deciding their cause of action in relation to the proposed mineral sands mine project of the Nevada the Planning Minister rejected the development of the resorted Apollo Bay from several main reasons the excessive size and scale of the development it was inconsistent with the surrounding land use it was an inappropriate development for the region and would have had a negative impact on the iconic township of Apollo day and because of the large number of objections received at this point I would like to draw attention to our East Gippsland Council plan 2017 to 21 which states the council 's vision is to develop East Gippsland into the most livable region in Australia I would also like to draw attention to the council 's Linda know Community Plan which describes the importance of the unique natural environment and States that agricultural land should be given priority to other uses like the resort project the proposed mine would be inappropriate because of inconsistent with C with the council with the surrounding land use and the noise of mining operations and here be trucks of the potential contamination of river water and town water supplies the toxic dust got windy days unable to be prevented in spite of the applications world 's best practice methods and will hardly make some parts of these skips than the most livable place in Australia or even a desirable destination to visit the Planning Minister said propose resort development Apollo Bay fill surely the government 's action plan to the great ocean road to improve tourism and better protect the area it seems that the development of the proposed mine near Linden Oh would likewise fall short of councils plan three skips then 2017 21 it 's interesting to know Kolak odd way councillors encourage the community participation at every stage of the deliberations about the development application between two hundred and three hundred submissions opposing the apollo bay resort were submitted to the planning panel including the submission from the collet earthquake councillors obviously far more than two hundred residents live in and around apollo bay yet the Planning Minister conceded that this number of submissions was huge and a true representation and reflection of the feelings resort in its current form in December 2018 council roberts tabled a motion that essentially asked our mayor and councillors to represent the majority wish of the Skip 's land communities and advise revelant relevant government ministers of our concerns about the proposed mine and our opposition to it tonight we asked counsel not to rescind that motion not the amendment made to that motion by counselor Ellis who explained clearly that his amendment was to give the motion a broader context thereby extending the application of the original motion to include all future development proposals in East Gippsland thank you miss rate of intention miss Debbie brothers Thank You Madame air I refer to the rationale for the motion which stated the motion lacked clarity the opportunity to ensure the motion was clear was at the time the motion was being debated before the vote was taken questions about clarity weren 't raised at the time because the direction and intent were unambiguous you only have to listen to the record of the live streaming of that meeting to confirm that if cast vote Pelton counsel routine I thought their job properly as elected representatives to ensure before they vote on a motion that they are clear about it please morning after the council meeting the merits pop and ABC radio get Celyn and confirmed that the council had made a decision and that it was the role of counsel to move forward and implement that decision no mention was made about any lack of clarity we want to know why this motion was lodged as an annulment rather than an amendment if it is about lack of clarity this is an extremely important point that goes to the validity of this motion counselor Pelt 's has requested to address that question when she speaks to the motion it is clear the decision that counsel officers had instructions to act in an efficient and timely manner to write to various politicians it is contended that is not the role of counsel officers to seek to interpret the decision of counsel it is their role to communicate the decision recorded in the minutes counselors had the opportunity to legally challenge the motion at the last council meeting of motion number no counselor moved it the chairperson of the TRG and said the council is able to take a position to support the community and oppose the mine and continue to participate in the EES process to ensure councils and the community 's interests are represented based on all this it must be said that this motion has all the appearance of an obstruction rather than working together as our elected officials should to ensure the community 's concerns are addressed furthermore it is nonsense there wasn 't any specific resolution or outcome in relation to Action Council employees were to write to a range of politicians including the premier and our local members tim bull and darren chester writing is an action there is another point to address in councilor palces motion we would 've thought by now would it be abundantly clear that opposition to this proposed mind is much broader than your reference to the Glenelg adèle community that should have been cleared from the breath of people who spoke at the last meeting from reference to over 5,000 petition signatures from individuals and 200 signatures from business many historic problems with the EES process and that the Minister for planning can approve the mine even if the EF says there are too many environmental risks the decision is made in Melbourne it is too late then if the council doesn 't take a position to oppose as mine now which it could be said it should have been done sooner than the opportunity to let the premier and ministerial decision makers know reviews could be lost and we met just find that the mine goes ahead knowing this could happen it is incumbent on you through your councillor code of conduct to be our quote advocating the interests of the local community to other governments and always anticipating and accepting the consequences of decisions made our politicians and decision-makers need to listen to the speed back otherwise they will think the community and council have no objections in conclusion hand on your heart your respectively requested to vote against this rescission motion thank you [Applause] Miss Anita Schaefer me down Maren counselors as you are aware when you stand her election you are often asked to express who are voting will be aware of your position and potentially elect you on the basis of what you say you are going to do or to advocate for once elected before you are elected to council in 2016 you were all asked for your position on the proposed mineral sands mine I would like to take the opportunity to remind you of what you said about the mind at the time and how that has shown itself in relation to councillor Roberts motion last December to support the community in a posting Damone and to write to the relevant ministers accordingly as councillors Buckley elders and Roberts and white have already shown they are listening to the community 's concerns by voting in favor of that motion the information I am providing only covers lows councillors who gave their position on the mine in 2016 and either voted against the motion in December and or were parties hwachun 's that the recession motion being voted on tonight although counselor retardo who voted against the councillor Roberts in December and was one of the three councilors involved in putting forward the mine in 2016 so I can only guess what ladies however I would like to remind Mira tamil councilor pills counselor reads and counselor to eat of what they said at the time Mara O 'Connell said that she believed the proposed mine would have many environmental economic and social impacts and would need to meet a range of criteria including an Aes if it was to be approved she also said that she would engage extensively with the impacted communities and advocate for a decision that was in the best interest hasil Apelles said that it was important to balance the prospect of economic growth and potential jobs against parent investment and health she also said that she had reservations about the positioning of the mine near a water supply and river that is relied on the vegetables and crops and that it would continue to be a huge issue for the new council counselor Chui toward the mine site and said he was against the mine councillor Reeves said that he would not let any development progress that would threaten our Linda no flex agricultural area and or our Shire and region simple he said councillor Reeves had previously gained a lot of respect thank you miss Schaefer when he took a lead decision in support of the successful anti-fracking motion that went before the council in 2016 thank you your time is now Thank You mr. Schaefer that 's mining in the Shire and to write to the premier and politicians recording mr. Schaefer your time is now can you please ocean licenses thank you mr. George near fighter I have three brief points point one in my submission to Council on a bib at the December 2018 I advised as a barrister and solicitor the council 's opposition of the proposed fingerboards mineral sands mining project does not bear it from participation in all the steps open in the environmental effects diamond progression well we have the process I find it perplexing that some councils still have the view but by opposing the mine they will somehow lose input or a right in the different processes given this erroneous opinion and I recommend council immediately seeks independent legal advice if it hasn 't already done opinion and put this matter to rest point two I have some concerns on the procedure for the notice of rescission local law 1l 7.4 least three elements required for the notice of rescission to be valid these are three councils must propose it the notice must be delivered to the chief executive officer within 48 hours of the council meeting and the motion must not have been acted upon I am satisfied that the two elements were complied with I had been advised by councillor Pelt 's that the notice of rescission was delivered just within the 48-hour deadline which begs the question had the motion being action David the preceding two days a party communicating opposition of the mind either verbally or in writing would trigger this element thus the motion would be deemed as acted upon the me spoke on ABC radio the morning after the notice of motion was decided and communicated to the world the council is opposing the mine I expect the CEO had written to the member for geek East Gippsland or sorry Gippsland east timber MLA who is the listed party to senior officers would have also communicated this position over the two day period I therefore pose this question to Council had the decision being communicated to any person party despite the notice of rescission the answer that can become yes that 's the nurse 'll rescission isn 't valid in and in good conscious council should either vote against the rescission or rock the allow it to lapse by not having the item forward i 'm sure if actual documentary evidence evidence services proving the decision had been acted upon the community will pursue the matter with much bigger lastly 0.3 through my lawyers i formally asked the CEO and the men on the 18th January 2019 to investigate whether any councillors have voted on items in respect to the mine or having a direct or indirect conflict of interest while under the code of conduct the owners to decide whether a conflict exists is solely on the individual councillor this is not a subjective decision but a legal determination for sure to the Local Government Act 1989 at this stage I have not received in response so I therefore does not have a conflict of interest to immediately disclose these and comply with the relevant provisions Thank You mr. near party [Applause] miss Meredith Yuri thank you madam mayor councillors you 've listened to many voices in relationship to this post mine and I commend your efforts to gather information here as many perspectives as you can including going on field trips expanding your knowledge and understanding in order to make the best decisions that you can and I thank you for this opportunity to speak since being on the council I 've been I 've gone back to study I 've done an MBA and a master of strategic foresight so I 'm a futurist and I wanted to speak to this proposal from the perspective of futures and foresight this evening I 'm not sure how much I 'll get to say one of the tools used in strategic foresight is to create a preferred future because the future hasn 't arrived yet and I think it 's sort of quite enlightening to acknowledge that we have a role in creating that preferred future and that 's set a vision and to set the way to get there using five-year plans or whatever so to think about the sort of preferred preferred future that we want I think in East Gippsland is something that 's a useful a useful thing to to do but if we set a vision it doesn 't make any sense to not act on it it implicates us to act to achieve that vision just to say a word about a big wide and deep lens which we can use when we consider a proposal to weigh it up and we now have a great deal more access to information than we 've ever had before in my parents time as landholders at Fernbank land clearing for sheep and cattle grazing was still continuing and it still does in some states but here in Victoria we now protect our native bed station and give value to our natural environment with varying layer with varying levels of success obviously we know from historical records the effects of certain developments and in this example we can access the the track record of Calabar and access to more information we can also be wiser about the process of just about the actual process of decision-making we don 't automatically assume that our own views are best we know that there will be a valid range of varied community views on any contentious issues in the community which should be sought and are being listened to by councillors we have learned to value and second indigenous perspective and we know that we will unavoidably bring our own bias to any consideration so the council is charged with making wise decisions for our community using big wide and as deeper lens as possible as such you have to weigh up the risks of the proposed development to our environment to our communities and to our economy of course you also play a key role in economic development and the availability of jobs in this area and in speaking to the community about their views I 'm trying to hear what what the major concerns are and for many people this is jobs as a primary issue thank you miss Yuri [Applause] mr. Casey Richie thank you very proudly proudly acknowledges the gun I own our people we acknowledge their rich and continuous culture and pay our respect to their elders past present and emerging we acknowledge the gun I own our peoples those are the first peoples and the traditional owners and custodians of the land and water on which we live work and play we show respect to the gun okay now people by conducting our business accordingly and in the best interest of all Aboriginal and non-aboriginal people we work with we recognized the value an ongoing contribution of the gun okay my peoples and we embrace the spirit of self-determination and reconciliation working towards a shared vision of equality and ensuring an unbiased voice for all we also pay our respects to everybody present tonight and acknowledge the shared emotional distress this mine has caused the store as a community and once again on behalf of the band style core Youth Council in the wider Aboriginal community we say no to the Fingal fingerboards mineral sands mine a colonial town as I stated in my last address these Gippsland is home to some of these sites continue to provide a valuable insight into our reach into the rich history of the land the rock formation ceremonial sites and trading and hunting grounds found in and around Glen Allerdale are extremely meaningful to a ganar Kenai peoples and his preservation is vitally important for our identity and the continuation of our rich cultural history many of these sites and more are facing threats of extension from mining development and the proposed mine will unequivocally affect our ancient local history as a community we can not let this happen in addition we cannot let the the lives livelihoods and memories of generations of Aboriginal and non-aboriginal people who have lived thrive in survived of this land be lost in the name of mining development we know that mining in other areas nationally and internationally has and will cause colossal and irreversible damage to the land and ecosystem developing a mind he will anonymously affect every person every family and every plant and every animal and every waterway in the Southeast region I cannot stress enough how much we do not want to see this happen in on has looked after us it has housed us it has fed us for generations so how can anybody from this community want to cause it so much damage along with everyone that inhabits it again I will say the negative risk associated with developing a mind far outweigh any benefits if this man were to go ahead it will negatively affect people and the environment by forcing from their homes and preventing them from accessing clean food and water it will impact on our culture health and livelihoods and those of our future generations it will continue to cause division and discord among the people and continue to show change the social dynamics of that community these impacts are exacerbated when our local community are not consulted about a plant mind even worse when our community are not giving given a say on whether a man goes ahead or not like in many parts of Australia our peoples hunting grounds and ceremonial lands were simply stolen without discussion we cannot continue to let this happen we will not be silent and we will collectively and determinedly fight against this is up mr. Richie your time is up your time is up mr. Richie thank you having divulged that the time was limited we would have prepared so thank you [Applause] mr. neo borracho thank you madam their last time I spoke about future rainfall decline and the allocation of water I sent an email out to all the councillors on what I said and I asked if there 's anyone wish to challenge and I will apologize to Victor Hugo I thought I had you included him in the email but when I checked last night I hadn 't now week as I made it here last time I spoke we can 't afford to be allocating the water with the likelihood of future rainfall decline but tonight I thought I 'd be brief being style rainfall chart 1880 to 2018 published in the bean style advertisers he was 28th of January present rainfall decline is significant the last and it says 701 millimeter average from 1890 to 2018 now last five years have been 585 millimeter which is like a basically over a hundred millimeters down and the rainfall being down isn 't significant because there are long it can be shown that long-term lunar cycles have affected the last two years so last five years rainfall I am NOT putting any significance into that but the last decade is 612 millimeter nearly a hundred millimeter down and the previous decade 1999 to 2008 was 599 millimeters now we cannot afford to be taking more water out of the out of the system with the present rainfall decline that 's happened over the last two decades now if you 're on Facebook or if you 're probably what 's in the news there 's been massive problems in the murray-darling because they allocated water that was available during a period of very high solar activity which relates to high rainfall solar activity has dropped off and the murray-darling has significant problems we have significant problems in the Gippsland lakes because they 're previously taken out too much water from the system and another thing that most people aren 't allowing for is that the catchments of all our rivers are becoming significantly more scrubbed up because of very up of the catchments is going to significantly reduce the water yields of our rivers so with the present loss of rainfall we cannot even be considering a venture that will use this much water Thank You mr. Barrow [Applause] mr. Alan Sheridan [Applause] I also was prepared to speak for five minutes I went into the office to get deformed the be here tonight and was a sugar that it would be a five minute that we would have to speak and now he 's cut it down to three minutes until I think he 's absolutely rude now I had a fairly long-winded discourse prepared about the the difference in the way counselors behind now am i used to behave fifty years ago give them the benefit of my experience at that time when there was none of this right where you 've got for exploding one way and five owning another they all used to vote independently irrespective of what the politics were or what they took they never look sideways they will put up their hand and vote it as individuals which is what you have from this book as long as you stay within the timeframe this is a book called friends of Pelham this book was written by a fella called Rock McCray who took four years of farming to fight a mining company had Felton in Queensland anyone and this is the this is all the things that they did and all the ways they beat these mongrels that are trying to destroy our family now this book is the Bible of how to fight like or just really little bit in the forward imagine if fifteen percent of the world 's people was hungry and inspired global population was protected to him was projected to increase by 30 percent over the next forty years many net defeated ourselves until then we needed to be used more fair world had produced in the past 10,000 years imagine if wealthy Middle Eastern countries had sir completed their educational necklaces that they were buying a flat land here in Africa to supply them with food imagine about the four percent of Queensland were suitable for ground crops and yet even that small area was not driest inhabited content of the cognitive the on earth with I haven 't got my green glasses on that 's what 's wrong sir this is better when I get to imagine if it 's trying to sleep down the driest inhabited continent on there which communities across the in the land we live the grab order for their very survival where the extraction of water by families were strictly controlled yet mining companies were permitted to take as much as they like with their restrictions Thank You mr. Sheridan I just got one more difficult listeners imagine your favor would a day to speak against up against all this matters were branded by all and sundry as extremists [Applause] mr. David warned thank you madam chair my previous presentation to Council regarding this matter was as president of the gift sound like to recreational fishing Alliance the views expressed in that presentation have not changed north as a position of VR fish the officia is a big representational body of recreational anglers in Victoria and they will advocate against this project to government we have totally opposed to any particularly excessive water extraction and pollution given recent events of the murray-darling it 's obvious the water management will be front and centre of advocacy from the view of the recreational fishing community this will be particularly true for the true beauties of the gifts and likes I can assure the council that anyone else who has an interest in any attempt to obtain more water from the Gippsland lakes rivers particularly the Mitchell will come under increasing scrutiny and opposition the G FA and via fish are advocating that the primary responsibility for government federal state and local and water management authorities in managing our waterways is to the environment first without water nothing else matters since my last presentation to Council on the 11th of December it 's appropriate that I inform the council that I am making this presentation as convener of the newly formed these Gippsland alliance the ETA represents a number of community groups that are active stakeholders around the gifts and lights the Gibson Lakes catchment and East Gippsland these groups currently number 17 range from friends of the earth and Melbourne to the representatives from across the political spectrum and our common concern is protecting the environment of East Gippsland especially in regard to water we are not opposed to mining but we are opposed to mining projects too threatened to pollute or extract water from the waterways that are significant to the environment and communities particularly in Gippsland Lakes the gift an likes one of Australia 's most significant and important waterways economically and socially they have been degraded by for decades by industrial activities that have placed economic development before environmental protection while we accept that economic development is important when it takes precedence over the environment it is counterproductive and the true cost of the community is really considered the current breed for the UGA is concerned with the proposed mining projects that fingerboards Glen Abelardo and the round out Stockman copper mine at the head of the Tambo River near on you the NGA opposes these projects from the basis they are in completely unsuitable regarding location their environmental impact unacceptable risk to the rivers on which they are to be located and ultimately that keeps their lives Thank is Shannon Woodcock and I 'm a settler here I arrived uninvited on Ghana kunai country two years ago and I 've made my home here I begin by acknowledging we 're all here today on unseeded gun I cannae country I acknowledge and pay my respects to the sovereign gun icono people who are here tonight and thank you and I pay my respects to organic hero sovereigns of the future the present in the past I acknowledge and respect the First Nations warriors both human warriors and the more than human warriors who have been forced by us white settlers to fight our relentless invasion incarceration and genocide ongoing now for 231 years god I can 't oh people have never seen in sovereignty so what does it mean for me to come here tonight as a white person and say gun lighter no people have never seen its sovereignty it means that there has not yet been a treaty between us settlers and I like to know people here in country and it also means that our colonial political sovereignty the very existence of this council and you to represent us in our opposition to the proposed mind all of our political sovereignty is nested within an inalienable and unseeded gun okay no sovereignty in this country we are here today only because of country and country is inseparable from gonna turn our community law and people this concept of nested sovereignty where our claims to sovereignty as settlers nest within the inalienable done I cannae sovereignty this is not just an abstract concept or a legal philosophy which is also is from Audrey Simpson or just an academic way at a point our white settler claim to rule is untethered to the ground we 're walking on nested sovereignty is actually a very good way for us to understand our place in country as settlers as many of you have said tonight we literally cannot breathe without the oxygen made here on country by country we cannot eat without the food from country and as so many people have pointed out the water belongs to country as well and sustains us these are basic facts what we sit here the forests are burning some of the smarter than after dropping dead from the trees because white settlers have cut down their habitat counselors I urge you to consider your moral obligations to represent our sincere opposition to the proposed mineral sands mine our physical existence and the political structure of our very colony is nested within enduring gonna like her no sovereignty and country I asked you to not rescind the motion and to represent a strong community opposition to the proposed mineral sands mine thank you mr. Cain Bush thank you madam L thought organics is a family-run Australian certified organic farm on the mid-river flats 13 k 's west of band style at hillside bush organics is in the top 10 organic vegetable producing businesses in Australia the bull shop the Bush family farm began almost 100 years ago on the beautiful fertile soils of the narrow flats for four generations we have considered our soils to be the lifeblood of a successful family farm farming operation situated on the mitchell river flats the soil here is highly regarded as some of the best in the country it is critical that we look up but for all the vegetable producers in the lumina valley which organics is a member of the East Gibson food cluster as cited by the executive officer Nicola watts at the last council meeting the a scapes and food cluster does not endorse anything or practice that has an impact on the clean green image of produce stringent certification requirements must be met for our business to continue to receive this organic certification he is inconceivable that we and other organic producers in the area will be able to continue to receive our certification should the proposed mineral sands Monica Dale proceed given we are only a few hundred metres downwind from the site we are concerned about the impact of dust on our produce will which will impact on organic certification as well as the health risks to us and our workers in the field from silica dust which is a well known carcinogen when inhaled there are other organic businesses in the valley that will face similar concerns the East Gibson shot councils need to consider whether the future of the organic horticultural businesses and the other organic for what we contribute the local economy in terms of thousands of jobs services and income that are long-term sustainable contributors or if the counselors are prepared to risk that for the short term and less than 200 jobs the mine might provide way as well as nine other major horticultural businesses in the valley were involved in a horticultural cultural impact study was initiated by the vff and funded by caliber six of the ten of this were involved in our study of decided speaker and against that report and we have advisors caliber of that violetta yesterday raising a multitude of questions as calibers response does not address the our concerns just in closing someone with a degree in agricultural science I specifically asked the mayor to consider the environmental concerns of the local agricultural businesses before casting her vote and to remember that those concerns can be ignored by our state politicians if they want more in development to proceed at any cost thank you for the opportunity to speak mr. Glenn MA leaving that did you acknowledge the Gallacher my people tonight yes forty to fifty hundred years we 've shown America I 'm out it may lose and I 'm terribly reliant on water from the aquifer the boys tell aquifer and its main recharge area is the Mitchell River the Mitchell river leaks into that aquifer to fill it it has other recharge spots the chain holes in Providence Poland just part of the recharge for that aquifer the urban fisherman however he has discovered that getting rid of professional fisherman is not going to create more fish for in this light system is an s3 light system not a saltwater pane this light system will not give your fish until it has fresh water and we 're not going to get that if we give more water away we can 't afford to get more water away it 's not enough going into the environment now as a rivers get drier and the water gets less that moves stresses on to other operations eg farming to avoid the problem of dams running dry over the last five to six years I 've spent quite a lot of money on troughs the troughs are by the mutual river the dams on all the other rivers on the Wellington end of the lake have made sure that we don 't get enough freshwater into that Lake as a teenager I would ride a horse down willis road to the edge of the lake Wellington I would take the saddle off the horse hand in bubula tree exercise abortion put the seller back on horse and ride home the booba gala Tori is still there but he 's one-half change out in the water the salt water from the lack of fresh water back into our lights is killing lights you want to have a tourism thing to bargain with shortly the the the preciousness of the freshwater is paramount and we can 't afford to give any more water away and no one is declared where the water 's coming from recharging of aquifers from a river system is suicidal you pump in the dead rats and the dead water and the bacterium that is filtered out through the DaVinci system as a water leaks into the aquifer there 's where you get your pure before I went ahead and said go ahead boys because if there 's not enough water it 'll reflect upon us all and I think the biggest issue in this mine is where is the water coming from source for my man here he 's learning man yeah many about seven eight years ago to work abroad notification on the boys all Africa that we were gonna cut low on water we were going to be cut back to 75% of allocation that is the GSP a area from sale to here meanwhile on the on the Latrell which runs down through Woodside to yow the farmers were given money to go deeper after the war that why why because it won 't end of it they 've got it so using that water and the other side you 've got lawyer we 're not going to tell big business where to go are we Thank You mr. mayor so we now move on to item 2.1 notice of rescission number one 2019 opposition to propose me nor sands mining an East Gippsland region do we have a move up and I 'd like to explain thank you Thank You councillor retainer Thank You councillor pouts thank you all of you for coming here this evening again I am I accept that you do you are passionate for your cause and I can fully understand and appreciate there are extremely environmental sensitivities about this proposal and we do respect you for your comments and everything that you 've presented tonight as well as what you presented at the 11th of December we 've heard all of your comments we 've read all of your letters that you 've put in to us the motion of rescission was done for a reason and I 'll explain to you why and I hope you can understand from a professional counselor point of view it was done in regards to the utmost respect of the community and for what 's going ahead the rescission was purely based on the wording of the motion unfortunately lack guidance direction and was inconclusive of what was actually needed or asked for excuse me I think I 'll hide in the back because we 've listened to 've had your say my vote around the table actually counts so if you 'd like to be quiet I will actually deliver it please stop calling out and allow the councillors to speak scepticism I 've got a lot to say thank you and you can all be quiet while I say it skepticism is not a valid reason for this project to proceed it is something that is based on pure facts and the government will be dealing with that with the AES process Council is not the governing body that actually makes the decision about whether this mind goes ahead the rescission of motion was based on the fact that the wording says whilst he also all believed that Jackson Roberts councillor Roberts motion had something to do with this it actually didn 't he got overrun by councillor Ellison so councillor Roberts wording in his motion was taken away when councillor Alice 's motion was actually supported so the bottom line for me as to why I wanted to rescind this motion was as I asked on the night you state the community 's opposition to region it is too inclusive of the whole of the region who is to say that mineral sand mining is not appropriate to be done in Taba Genoa or any of our other outer regions or any other region this issue is purely a site-specific concern and that is the basis as to why this recession was done respectfully and professionally to look after the rest of our community besides the hundred and fifty people that I can count here tonight that have come out to raise their objections we respect you for that and that is fine but you need to respect us for what the processes are within Council which is what we 're delivering to you the community 's opposition well it implies that the whole of the community meeting 45,000 people all object to the proposal 45 thousand people have not objected to the proposal a hundred and fifty people who are here tonight or who you have on your petitions which you claim a 3-3 and we 've asked you to present them in you haven 't so we can 't actually take that figure the bottom line is respectfully we are doing this in the basis of the majority of our community and what they have I respect please keep it down or you 'll be asked to leave the proposal of writing to the premier and the federal state and shadow ministers is fine on behalf of the the concern communities of the mineral sands project but the bottom line of incorporating the whole of our community is not acceptable to me I also have had many phone calls in regards to people in support of this and we 've had letters in support of this because there 's a lot of fight foes flying in fly outs a lot of people in our community that are waiting for this project to go ahead if it should happen so they 'll be happy please refrain from calling out and allow the council at a speech they will be eligible to be receiving jobs with this company if that 's to happen there is a number of valid environmental sensitivities such as the proposed mine site that cross the clothes that are close to our region 's major water supply which is of a Mitchell River something the wrong man I do apologize Mitchell River I 'm sorry there was a lack of concentration at the time the close proximity to our region 's major water supply within five kilometers directly downwind from it is a very major concern to all of us in this room and to our whole community it supplies 36,000 people which is the bulk of our community I 'm sure this will not go unheard from the minister and the lights of the people making the decision on this one of Victoria 's major vegetable growing regions is directly down here within 350 meters again this will not go unheard and you need to realize by having us supporting you you can actually write in to the minister and the decision makers yourselves and it would be great substance you have well that 's fantastic then they 've heard it growing the vegetable farmers of this region have grown they they 've marketed themselves on it on being clean green and organic all of those titles we have heard Brisbane Sydney Melbourne Canberra all of the markets and overseas the lasting and lastly the possibility of contamination downstream from our world-renowned beautiful peeps fan lights delicate ecosystem is something that cannot be and should not be negotiable to any minister making a decision on this they need to fully understand and they will understand the bottom line is they will get on line and they will view this footage and it 's been worded here tonight and your support has been documented here tonight given the fact that the the motion that was decided upon on the 11th of December was inadequate we have we had we have decided to rescind it on the grounds that it was in a inappropriately worded and it lacked clarity for the officers to actually act upon we hear what you 're saying hence the rescission was made and Marya there is no reason why this passionate group could not write and I 've said that before to the relevant ministers informing them of their concerns of the project so basically we are here we 're not here to make a decision about here to make a decision about whether we rescind this motion and if we do may I have clarity on this mr. CEO if we rescind this motion tonight is there an opportunity for this proposal to come back to the table in a well worded document through you madam chair yes any councillor can can submit a motion to be considered by Council at a future at a future meeting date that 's all mine madam mayor thank you Thank You councillor Pelt 's does the second or wish to address the question thank you madam mayor of course also would like to make it quite clear that we 're here with this rescission motion because the amended motion which became the substantive motion on December 11 2018 like clarity and direction for our offices to act on effectively and that was the advice that was given to us the amendment should have been clarified by the mover and seconder was there motion it was there amendment on the night it was moved and became the substantive motion and this is often a symptom of trying to make or motion I had no issues with the wording whatsoever but it was amended that wasn 't my doing that was the doing of the gallery on the night if the amendment wordy had shared with all counselors thus being truly open and transparent then perhaps we wouldn 't be here tonight dealing with this it could have been clarified back in December if you want to debate the merits of the original motion that 's fine but this rescission motion has been brought about by the way that we were trying to do things on the fly under significant pressure on the night I maintain my position of consistency and which I 've said all along and thank you for pointing that out at the started when we were elected I 've always maintained that we must wait for the legal BES process to be adhered to and follow through logical rational well-thought-out arguments are a far more convincing than purely exaggerated emotive argument designed to sensationalize bully enforce and intimidate an opinion on to others is far more effective a good example of this is recently I 've also decision-making which relates to the psychology and bias behind human decision-making simply put emotional and reactive type thinking is our system one type of our brain working more often than not and it 's extremely it 's extremely important that for complex decisions we require to use our system to thinking which is a far deeper analyzing and synthesizing complex information into manageable tracks start calling out system one thinking can lead to psychological biases and anchoring leading in overconfidence in decision-making in a state of overconfidence dangerous and unsustainable decisions can be made overconfidence usually leads to people ignoring important bits of information in major decision making and it 's been blamed for such disasters as Chernobyl reactor disaster the Apollo spaceship disasters and most recently and most recently the global financial crisis my point madam mayor it 's not going to be the loudest is going to be heard my point madam mayor is that we need to receive all the relevant scientific information through a legal IES process and make our decisions for the whole of the community based on facts thank you Thank You councillor Tina counselor retain room place you 'll be asked of the chamber of the community in the chamber place he 's a motion opposed the motion is opposed by several councillors I 'd like to speak against the motion please madam mayor thank you firstly I 'd like to thank all the people that have put in so much time and effort to come to these meetings and these last couple of meetings would have to be some of the most well attended in the East Gippsland Shah history and potentially the shire bands dealt to my being council is still a very strange sensation definitely not something could have foreseen even three years ago yet here we are this issue has been extremely challenging from a professional and a personal standpoint but I 've learned quickly what happens when you go against the grain when I first read of the rescission notice and the accompanying rationale I was told that it was in my best interest to give me the time give me the time to get the wording right despite the fact that nobody on nobody on the night speaking to ABC radio the following morning if councillors were serious about fixing the wording then they would have done just that as council lepelt stated I had a man I had a motion that could have been considered that could have been brought to tonight 's meeting via an amendment instead an unnecessary motion of rescission was put forward I called a special meeting of council to enable a swift resolution to give some closure to the community that is putting so much time and effort into this campaign in response and with respect to the councillors who were on pre-scheduled leave I was told by Romanian councillors they could not attend because of the need to complete Christmas shopping and that council had finished up for the year I was not aware the council had a closure date further that I still had various community events in my calendar that required councillor attendance as did others around the table so when it became clear that might no more than four councillors would attend I counseled the special council meeting under duress and for fear of waste in the by boycotting the special council meeting originally planned for the 20th of December councillors displayed a clear predetermined bias towards the rescission motion indicating there was no possible avenue for debate so that leads us to now where the rescission motion will likely be carried with no opportunity for balanced discussion I urged current councillors here to reconsider the claims at the original motion opens up Council to any legal complications is farcical and has been invalidated time and time again if there is a question about specific wording or definition I urge you to read the motion again council and community are one and the same and we must remember that thank you [Applause] speakers for thanks mayor and good evening everyone I suspect I spoke to too many of you at st. Mary 's Hall in November last year but I again thank you all for your contributions tonight it 's important now I 've made my position clear in many public forums that the legal and legislative process for dealing with this matter is yes now we all want the same thing for our community we all others this includes guarantees of environmental integrity water amenity safety economic security cultural history and so on we all have a right to these we also have a right to the wealth in our community but with these rights comes responsibilities on all of us we have a responsibility to make fair and consider decisions for the whole community now I have a mutual respect for you and I wish to reassure all of you that the way to ensure the best outcome for the interest group and the community is the legislative and legal process that 's the EES now last year council took a strong and unified position there was unanimous agreement around this council chamber to press the state government for an independent third-party review of Vettii yes we all agreed to that counselors and this was agreed to by the state government a powerful decision and a powerful outcome this notice of motion unfortunately in both its forms compromises that capability I believe it creates for us the legal situation of apprehended bias and among other potential compromises you 've heard already and I 'll say that 's the case Council has no direct ability to grant or refuse the application from the proponent we 're not the deciding making Authority our ability to have influence now and in the future depends on our ability to remain unbiased free from apprehended bias and the notice of motion compromises this council and its ability to govern for the whole community so therefore therefore I support this rescission and remove need to move on get the es and interrogated for you Thank You councillor Reeves speakers against thank you madam ma 'am thank you madam mayor for this opportunity to speak against the notice of rescission before this table this evening I would also like to particularly acknowledge and welcome back council of wide and I wish him the very best in this time of difficulty counselor audits backed by several of the speakers tonight as address counsel on the negative impact the boycotting of his requested special meeting has had on the effective representation of local government and I will leave this lo moment in our history of it that is the history of the East Gippsland of his predicted behaviors that is the apprehended biasness of that as a consequence of that boycotting of the meeting does not come to fruition tonight and that the arguments that we put forward as to why the notice that rescission should be overturned supported counselors tonight this is a matter of process well we 're not going to go into the arguments of the environmental effects statement that is something that is a furphy I will however focus my part in this debate solely on the process that is on Council of belters position that the substantive motion should be rescinded or filed I argued that the motion should stand and be respected as a and as a legitimate decision of council and enacted as a lawful direction of council this position lies in the very Durham Democratic core of local government representing and achieving the best outcome for its commune on page six counsellors of our most important document their recently revised council plan this responsibility is highlighted and driven home as a critical element of councils reason for being it 's not Li guessed that we are community the wishes of our council plan which each one of you at this table created that council in its community a-one and that 's a real message Council and its community are one that councils primary goal is to care for its community that is why this motion the motion must be overturned we all know that the substantive motion was debated and voted upon on the evening of the Tuesday the 11th December 2018 that the motion was passed four votes to three that neither during the debate nor after its conclusion did any of the councillors challenge the motions meaning or declare that they did not understand its world wording in fact I personally call calling councillors attention to the fact of the amendment to the east of the initial motion of councillor Roberts I see that some counters may not have liked the majority decision or members of the gallery gallery but they may certainly did not exhibit confusion or misunderstanding as to the wording and the intent and that 's an important word intent of the motion this fact was further reinforced by the words radio the next morning when she spoke words of support of the adopted motion this understand this understanding underlies a critical point in what all further discuss and put the council that is the decision of council was achieved by proper process was debated amended and voted upon by the elected councillors present regardless of whether one was by the decision it was a proper process and was not interfered with well overtly by outside bodies counselors are the decision-makers of counsel not the lobbyists of either side of the debate nor the council officers or even people here in this gallery did sneak this evening it is us who made the decisions tonight we adopted the minutes of the previous meeting and those minutes have been adopted as accurately reflecting the night 's motions and actions it 's an important action that was for output by councillors pelts and ratinho the opponents of or proponents I should say of the notice of rescission interesting I ask you to read and consider the motion paragraph by paragraph if you like and ask yourself where does the motion not meet with all your councilors will you just look at it think about what I 'm saying I suggest to you there is no genuine lack of carat clarity nor lack of direction none whatsoever I mean of course you could manufacture something that would be that but that would be unnecessarily in the streamys and their radius ly work against our council plan councillors the motion was one extremely easy to implement there was no lack of clarity or lack of direction in the contested motion and thus importantly possess no grounds for it to be rescinded all question I 've equal importance in the reason to not rescind the motion is the more pertinent a valid idn 't that CEO Antony vestment and members of the executive acted upon the motion pride to the issuing of the notice of rescission and that for that reason the notice should fail now on this point I ask Kansas to indulge indulgence in presenting this position for as you know I 've been a made aware and for that matter all counselors here this evening are in a precarious position due to the debating any argument in this council in this chamber I believe I may not be able to present all facts to my admin and I searched asked the CEO and governance officer to interrupt me if they consider and as a serious request if I if they feel I am preaching about to breach section 77 of the Local Government Act that is releasing information deemed to be confidential I wish to refer to the in particular to the interaction between our CEO Lansing he basswood and their local MP mr. temple a man who might consider to be a friend and one of Honor admired for some years however and may I say sadly and arguably contrary to the improved openness and transparency and can counsel decision-making the CEO has declared the interaction between he and mr. bull together with other documents emails and legal advice received associated with this debate secret or better said confidential under Section 77 of the Local Government Act a decision accepted by a majority but not all councillors in recent discussion in effect this decision was relayed to councillors by email at 49 to an earlier email sent on the 13th of December which I believe is covered by the Act so I can 't refer to its contents in effect this action precludes anyone in this instance been asserting with unchallengeable authority and I would last you to consider that or should I say confidence that the discussion in email exchange between the two did or did not for that matter include actions or agree decisions that a reasonable person could infer from such an exchange amounted to the CEO undertaking commencing actions to implement the desire of the motion and dust negate the validity of the notice of recession I would also be it would also be I suggest just as valid to say the CEO action the motion by agreeing to thought any actions the further the motion however and I 'm sure you will all agree that it would not be unreasonable to assume that both discussed what actions either wood or wood take or to enable alternatively be hindered the desired actions of the motion positive or negative and result the motion was subject to being acted upon agree that it would not be unreasonable showing that both discussed the actions I 'm sorry I 'm repeating myself I put it to the this exchange alone chose to see and a CEO even though the truth much is hidden from us acted on the motion before the notion of rescission was lodged and therefore the rescission must fail counsel was I asked in concluding don 't get to it conclude counselor I asked in concluding that you overcome any preconceived biased you 're having to the adoption of the motion I met up from what source thoughtfully consider the valid arguments are put to you and not support the notice of rescission before you this evening in several points I 'd like to draw your attention to which are not again miss Bennett this is where I 'm a bit concerned in the counselors mail there is a a list of correspondence that send out under the mayor 's signature in that there was a mail merge document in which it is shown a email was received by the CEO from mr. bull that and that was on to that but that is missing all other emails from to to and from other persons riding on that subject are recorded the documents here and you probably all have seen them I I say that it is not unreasonable the reasonable person to assume that some discussion some action whether it be just explaining to mr. bull what the decision the motion was is a reasonable action and it was implemented because the final part of the motion was to in a timely manner implement that notion that is create the request to action the the motion speak to and ask the members of parliament to write to the appropriate people I think that all right the documents aren 't there there 's some good examples of it in part in conclusion then I say please consider the actions that have arisen out of this this is an important action of council there was no lack of clarity with it it was quite clear I refer you to your being coming back to conclude council is part of the community we act where the voice of the community we of government and the community these people here tonight are here for a reason not just create troubles for dr. Hugo in these company they are here because they have a passion and they look to Council as part of their community as an authority part of their community to voice their concern and that 's all they are asking they 're not interfering I 'm not interfering in the process of the forum it 'll affect statement that 's a separate action for a separate time for a separate person and entity to make a decision on this argument tonight is about proper process that local government with Council complying with the wishes of its community and voicing its its concerns please support our opposition to this notice of rescission and vote no thank you speakers for councillor tui thank you mad at me excuse me it is pleasing to see to see everybody here tonight and I must say I 've had a number of people ring me in regards to my position on the mine and I can quite honestly tell you that personally I don 't cannot we cannot allow our entire community to be put in jeopardy by making a statement that could potentially show either a perceived or otherwise bias so my position is that excuse me thank you I do believe that this would compromise our ability as a council to make decisions on behalf of our community moving forward if we have this stand so that 's the reason why I support the rescission thank you thanks counselor Torrey speakers against councillor Buckley in supporting council Roberts I 'd just like to bring in this to your attention this is the Constitution Act 1975 that 's the state constitution and we go to work 74 B local government laws and we go down to paragraph I any other act matter or thing relating to local government administration so in saying this I say we 've got every right and every use every possible thing to and when it 's mentioned that we haven 't got any power or any effect on this that is very wrong constitutionally so thank you council Roberts for you if it 's I 've you know support madam mayor going back to the election of this council I was um I was humbled to be elected and I spoke that I was there for the people I 'm still humbled by the position I hold and I 'm still here for the people I would just like to say a couple of things about some of the speakers tonight it might be a little bit left field but I agree with mr. Solomon that was a battlefield out there of their people what do you think the Australian public would think a mining company was to start to dig up the fields of Flanders where our young men are buried from a hundred years ago you know wouldn 't there be some uproar so I plead with the whole community to consider the sacred sites that are out there I also would like to say that the river is at stage nine at this stage stage ten is no more water so no more crops and as has been said several times tonight that is very critical to human survival we don 't have a shortage of world and we have a shortage of water so the gallery is full of people who are passionate but what I what I would like to say is that it 's always the same it could be added at just at an election that there are so many in the community who actually don 't say what they 're thinking maybe they 're embarrassed or shy but there are more only the community who opposed this then you would believe if if we make decisions here that are unpopular with others then let the next council change it we have an obligation to our community to act on our thoughts and our feelings another thing that 's not been spoken of everybody is talking about jobs I came through the saga of blue gums where we saw small communities decimated people move away and jobs lost and there will be jobs lost in our community as a result of this mine those farms will no longer need Shearer 's they won 't need stock agents they won 't need fertilizer they won 't need livestock carriers so no one has jobs that the mind creates just consider those people who actually will be out of work as a result and they will be local people to think you matter me [Applause] Thank You counselor what in relation to comments made about my OBC interview which was done on the Wednesday morning following the council meeting at that point the rescission had not been put in place so at that point in time our role as councillors is to support the decision of council as we know a rescission can be made up to 48 hours following the meeting so at that point it hadn 't been lodged further to that we were advised that the most motion that was moved was not clear it lacked clarity and we have an obligation to ensure that motions are clear for our officers to action it is no lie but there is not one of us around this table that would be supportive of any activity that would destroy the agricultural industry at the wind and overly however we must consider all the relevant information and we don 't have that yet so have a right of reply thank you madam me Thank You counselors for your input tonight around the table we are from many regions and we are diversity now makeup in and what we believe and what we say we actually voted in by the community for the community and that 's the bottom line with that in tact I believe the recession was made responsibly for the community and whilst it 's in pieces at the moment I believe over the next you know month or so we 'll be able to endeavor to work together to get something that we can all support of similar instances of what will be appropriate in the light of this proposal moving forward so with that said madam ear I pass it back to you for voting thank you Thank You councillor pouts I 'll put the motion all those in favor please raise your hand all those against motion carried thank you madam mayor yes I can do have a brief a brief moment to ask you if everyone wants to believe they can leave and we 'll have a break thank you _"

CEO none have been submitted submitted metamath item 1.4 confirmation of minutes that the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on Tuesday 5th February 2019 be confirmed happy happy to move that thanks counselor retainer and councillor Reeves 1 all those in favor motion carried what 1.5 next meeting ordinary council meeting Tuesday nights of April 2019 to be held at a corporate center 273 Main Street Band 's Dale commencing at 6 p.m. 1 point 6 request for leave one point seven is public question time so I 've got a number of questions to get through so I 'll just ask those who have submitted to come forward and ask their question so first is miss rosemary Martin okay I have two questions one of which I think has been answered on the website but I 'll read it anyway given the current crisis facing the recycling industry and local councils in Victoria is recycled material collected in East Gippsland currently going to landfill or being sorted and recycled once recycled material is sorted in been style where is it ending up thank you and yes indeed this is a very topical issue so it is one that we issued a media release which is on our website last week reassuring the community that our recycling is indeed still being recycled and it is not going to landfill our there has been a lot of media attention around what 's happened with one of the recycling companies in operating out of Melbourne and Geelong that is not the company that we use so therefore our recycling is it at present our recycling is collected through our curbside collection through the company that we use for that it is firstly sorted in burn style and then that sorted recycling goes down to a recycling service in Melbourne where it is further recycled and processed I 'd encourage the community to look at there 's a really good YouTube video by visi it 's called if you search under busy recycling you will see it but shows not only the process that recycling goes through but also what what we can recycle and what happens to those products and how they 're processed for the system so our recycling is very much still being recycled and reused we would encourage our community to continue to use this really important service because it 's really important that we continue to keep as much of our our waste out of research out of landfill as possible thank you thank you very much my other question relates to the same topic the Friends of mallacoota has funded and managed a collection system for household batteries and light Globes and fluorescent tubes for many to small towns members have to transport this material to Ben 's tell them good counsel implement a collection service suitable for small and remote communities to remove toxic materials from our townships miss waggle Thank You kind of firstly commend you or your community group for the actions that you 're taking to unclick batteries and fluorescents it 's really important that we try and keep those out of out of our landfill system you 're correct at this point in time council offers a program through been through our detox your home program which is the only service that we 're currently running because of some of the challenges around logistics of opera offering that to small communities and remote communities however we 'll be very happy to work with you to work out how we can collect the those that are already being collected if there 's a central point in mallacoota we 'd be very happy to work through that how we can transport that down to be and sell and manage it through that detox detox your home program thank you thanks miss Martin mr. recently indicated in a letter to the Friends of mallacoota that existing staff permanently stationed in mallacoota may be utilized to undertake the duties of community laws officers would such staff be authorized to impound dangerous or stray animals impose fines and carry out all duties of such an officer and be available at weekends and also after hours for emergency situations would their training be equal to community laws officers thank you mr. Holden thank you very much for your question you 're right we are considering authorizing some existing staff in mallacoota to undertake duties in line with community laws officers in terms of being able to impound animals and and the like it 's very difficult because we don 't have those facilities located in mallacoota at present we would see that training is an important part of authorizing any officers to undertake those duties because those duties aren 't straightforward or simple and it can be seen as a frontline public relations role as much as an authorizing and an enforcement role so the short answer your question is I don 't believe at this stage functions of a local laws or a community laws officer but they would have the the capacity to fulfill a limited scope and and certainly we we are currently looking at it but we haven 't made any fast decisions at this stage thanks mister man mr. Neil Greg and sorry I was got the wrong question to start with I 've got to quit their two sets of questions mallacoota is surrounded by a world heritage-listed biodiversity region should the shire introduce a child charge for disposal of green waste as has been mooted how will it ensure that illegal dumping in bushland and the resulting weed invasions do not compromise the integrity of our environment thank you miss waggle thank you for your question it 's indeed an important issue um illegal dumping it 's very much a societal issue that is unfortunately being the caring for a long time and prior to and us introducing green wave charts green waste charges so it 's not necessarily linked however our local laws and our waste unit are working together with doe as well to combat this very issue several notices have been served to many of residents including some business operators here in Melanesia we do have a local law that specifically regards littering around vegetation dumping and input but enforcement can be a little difficult in situations where the waste is dumped in unless they 've got very clear evidence of that occurring councillor I guess would require community support to help us identify whether dumping was occurring and to manage some of that infringement process your question was also around the link between the green waste charges I think regardless of whether there 's a link between charging for green waste or not if council makes any charges any changes to its green waste collection and management this would be accompanied by an extensive community education program there would address many issues including illegal dumping I can 't comment on any future changes to our Greek and West charges because that 's really a decision of Council that has yet to be made however in the past one with council did have a charge for our green waste collection it was accompanied by several amnesty weekends could bring in their green waste at no charge and to make sure that people still had the ability to manage their properties and become fire prepared thank you for that one keeping food waste out of landfills should be a priority to this in malat Peter pair residents have supported the very efficient kitchen to compost program it 's been a great success in that for the residents what plans does the SHA have to expand this system to include food waste from caravan parks and the food handling businesses also what steps are being taken to ensure that green waste is not contaminated with industrial materials such as plastics treated pine and asbestos thank you another topic or a really good question you 're quite correct and we acknowledge and understand that food waste makes up about sixty percent of our total waste that 's going into our Redland litter bins and then into landfill so we have the intent of trying to divert as much food waste as we can from landfill and we 're looking at working on the processes that we introduced as a pilot technology and systems and associated end users that makes sure that we 're not only diverting at front landfill but creating a real really good end use product the kitchen to compost program has been a great success in mallacoota since it was introduced as a pilot some years ago however it does cost us approximately a hundred thousand dollars per annum operate this pilot project or this project so we 're really looking at how we can streamline that and find it in deuce for that that compost in that waste before we look at it introducing it to caravan parks and then explaining it out any further as you 've quite rightly identified one of the cool things as to making sure that it 's a good product and as an end users making sure they don 't like contaminants in there so that will be a continuing focus in of our which wastes education program the people understand what they can and can 't_''_834.29 put into the the compost bin that goes into the the kitchen to compost program so we keep those materials that you 're had a question as anybody around this table in this room even got any idea of what percentage of waste is food waste I 've heard very vaguest from from 43% down but that forty people about three percent sounds outrageous to me that couldn 't be right could it we actually undertake audits of periodic audits about bins and based on that we believe that it 's a high of 60 percent based on those audits surely somebody must be able to come up with something to do it 's all that you know divert it to compost or something like that surely and that 's exactly what the the mallacoota trial has been around the kitchen to compost has been exactly around that we went to trial it make sure it works get a really good end product and then we can look at it rolling it out for other communities as well I believe it was recognized with an award some years ago it 's being so innovative it 's been a great partnership with the community and when we look forward to continuing not just here council that thing very important that we are diminishing that waste from landfill thank you Thank You mr. Gregoire the next question will be read by the CEO I think you met Amir reading a question at the request of Jeannette Ori is Janette in the i3 my apologies so you are here that 's great Thank You mallacoota skatepark committee would like to know how to get the upgrade plans up and going and I would refer this to mrs. Nelson thank you look the the mallacoota community 's been very proactive in advising council about the priority that they see for the renewal of the skatepark upgrading it over quite a number of years the the recreation reserve master plan includes an upgraded skatepark as the sixth priority in that plan so it isn 't a priority that council has budgeted for at this time but certainly something that council does recognize it 's obviously at the moment councils priority is working on the sporting pavilion as part of the the recreation reserve this project to upgrade the skatepark would be something that would come as as a the community and with the committee of management and miss Aubrey we really encourage them to work through the committee of management to work with us to start to look at programming that in future capital budgets we 're aware that the community was proactive late last year or last year with the Victorian Government 's pick my project project and I thought that was potentially a really great opportunity for funding to be received but unfortunately only two projects in a skip zone actually were funded through that process so we 're certainly happy to work on work with the community to understand what funding opportunities might be and how the community might be best positioned to to receive funding but the fact that it 's in the recreation reserve master plan is one of the best things that can that can happen so happy to continue the conversation thanks miss Nelson mr. Martin Haile thank you will the council consider employing a part-time community engagement officer located in mallacoota to engage with the community on shire issues such as communicating councils plans and policies obtaining data and reporting on waste management practices and accessing the town on foot such as moving around mallacoota on footpaths roads and crossings thank you miss Nelson thank you look it 's a really interesting question and one that council is in the process of exploring not specifically a role like this but understanding how we do actually work with a more place focused approach to the way that council does its business in communities and while we haven 't anticipated an officer such as this because in many cases what we 'd like is that the community and council interact on a range of issues that you know might be quite specialists so we would prefer there 's broader interaction with the the organisation we are exploring at the moment in a number of communities the development of place plans and community plans which gives us then a much better structure for how we do actually interact with the community and I had a conversation with a number of people last night about whether that 's something that mallacoota as a community as a whole might like to discuss further with us going to send me some information about what 's been what 's been progressed already by community organisations here so that may be something that leads to council understanding how best to position ourselves to deliver services and interact with the community based on the need that 's a into the future so once again it 's a it 's a conversation that I 'd be happy to happy to have yeah thank you thank you my second question is the costs of waste disposal to the Shire are increasing will counsel investigate auditing a percentage of waste bins and then inform the audited ratepayers about their household waste and the ways they might reduce it mr. wykel Thank You Martin another great waste question counselor does it undertake periodic audits of our our bins and that 's how we know that there 's up to 60% of food waste in those bins the last of those audits was done two years ago and that then informs our waste education program moving forward I 'm not sure that we 've actually informed the community other than through some of our we have another audit scheduled for later on this calendar year and so we 'll certainly look at how we can get more of that information about what we 're finding in the audits out to our community because it 's very important information I think would shock you as it shocked us about what 's got what 's going into some of our bins so you can work on that together that would be fantastic thank you thanks mr. Hawley mr. John Hilbert Thank You counselors and I hope we have this shindig again maybe the same time next year you as president of business and tourist Association I give you a hearty welcome to return I have a two-part question will the council rebate the jetty fees and damage to mallacoota jetties being underwater for several months and are unusable mr. holder Council manages those the private jetty licenses on behalf of the Department of Environment land water and planning and there are a range of I guess constraints that Council has in terms of managing those those licenses I 'd like to take your question on notice you know via email in the coming week or so just so that I don 't provide you with any misleading information okay I understand that the that those private private jetties have been impacted by the closure of the entrance which of course counsel wouldn 't be liable for but it is an unfortunate situation so I 'd like to see what options are available for us before giving you a you know that 's okay thank you that I 'd welcome that and secondly due to the damage to infrastructure and business and danger to people currently trying to walk on slippery underwater jetties will the council encourage all parties to reconsider the 1500 height level before you open the bar mr. Holton that 's again this is one of those things that 's not in councils direct control there is i as there is a formula that is used by the various people who manage the waterway in determining when they when the time is ripe for creating a channel to reduce the to reopen the entrance the parties involved in that of the as the CMA a an onlooker to some degree however you know I 'm sure council would consider or officers would consider speaking to the CMA as a first as a first port of call to to see what options are available for them Thank You mr. Halton we certainly welcome that because the dilemma that many of our businesses and and interest organizations are finding is that there 's no one to complain to we can they 're civil I think last time we counted there three ministers a catchment Authority in there somewhere ports authority we think to quote from an early discussion we 're waiting for an accident to happen just about all the jetties certainly around Kools Inlet are unusable and slowly eroding that 's not a question that 's an observation thank you very much thanks mr. Hobart before you disappear if I might I 'm how you 've stated before that the jetties have been underwater for several months now how long would that period actually be since yeah three we 've had we 've had several people bring their boats in and and turned around we several months ago for their fishing expedition and we 've just lost them because it 's just too dangerous and there 's no easy way for them to launch their boats Eileen Backlund has there been any progress in the incident plan for Cabazon we had a public meeting last year and I said all the Kabataan residents had to put in a request to legislate that cab film was a safe area and we had that meeting and there are about 60 odd people that requested counsel to legislate that cabin area be a safe place I mean snow say thank you yes you 're right there was a meeting in October last year I think about 60 community members attended with all of the emergency services agencies where we did a scenario planning workshop and there was quite a lot of discussion as part of that about review of the local incident management plan and in particular creating an assembly point at the very least at car berthing now my understanding is at that meeting community committee was appointed to review them the imp and that work has document is back with the community members who were nominated to just check that we have recorded everything correctly so as soon as we have the tick off for that then the revised net will be published that document does include the car birthing area as an assembly area acknowledging that malakut is very dissected and there 's a number of different parts of town so it acknowledges that not everybody 's going to make it into the light then I would say for place right in town and the other thing that was talked about was the use of a community siren for the car birthing area that 's something that would need to continue to be worked through with the community so that there are some communities that use the siren in emergency for emergency warning purposes but it needs to be embedded in all of the emergency management processes so that its purpose is actually understood so that that would be an ongoing conversation but I 'm happy to ask the emergency management staff to reconnect with the community committee and just see where the documents at happened before this fire season and we 've escaped the bullet this year again but it 's so important that we are not left out in the cold well the review has actually happened we 're just checking with the community that it is actually and it is actually right so that was sent to the community earlier this year so we just need to chase out what 's what 's happened with that I was on that committee but I 'm not weird anyway so let 's hope you know it gets done before new summer oh thank you thank you miss Buckland miss Bridget senior mr. CEO did you have miss senior I would just ask that for privacy reasons that in your question that you leave out the address of of the issue that you 're you wishing to raise if you could do that for it like I mention mine absolutely other address if you could yep thank you thank you hello everyone how can counsel assist me with the verification of an issue whereby the occupants next door to me continually move my rubbish bins one phone court to the opposite side of the court which is for furn court for weekly collection and patio that is 14 years of speaking directly to the occupants of that particular address in relation to this matter has not been able to produce any acceptable outcome and I 'm just wondering how Council can help me thank you Miss Wagle elements of neighborhood dispute in it and it 's such it 's probably best that we take it off it or not own notice and then we can work directly with you rather than through this forum to try and rectify this issue so what do i do from from here I 've got your notes we 'll make contact with you okay because 14 years is not good for anyone 's well-being but thank you very much thank you Miss senior and thank you for all your public questions 1.8 record of assemblies of councillors for January in February 2009 teen I 'm happy to move the recommendation thanks County no thanks council pouts all those in favor thank you 1.9 petitions 1.9 point 1 petition of thank you madam mayor this report is essentially something of a holding report the petition that has been lodged six an off-leash dog park in Mita unfortunately the petition was received a little too late for officers to be able to prepare a substantive response so this response notes receipt of the petition and also commits officers to responding to it by Tuesday the 4th of June at the latest questions councillors have a recommendation before us happy to move that Mimi thanks counselor Tina thanks councillor Roberts for sickening all those in favor motion carried unanimously item one point nine point two petition objecting to the removal of 18 car parks on Nicholson Street between service Street and the mall mr. Richards thank you madam mayor so councillors you you would be aware of the Nicholson Street upgrade project and also the petition received I can advise that the number of signatories has actually we 've received additional signatories to that and and the numbers up to 909 I guess in in responding to that my first point is that we understand the perception that less car park excuse to consider so firstly using isolation so yes there is a reduction of car parks for this particular project but we need to acknowledge that this is part of a broader strategy so councillors would be aware of the document so reimagining van style and also the band 's doe CBD car parking strategy also acknowledging that in recent years there 's been an increasing increase in car parking within the CBD the numbers we have a 358 up to 427 as well as that there 's plans for more car parking to come so be aware of the for depends they or the proposal to to construct parking at the border bands there there 's also work going on to free up existing spaces so we call discussion about current private car park we 're up to I think the numbers were 73 out of 159 spaces were taken up for more than five hours on the particular day that it was surveyed so this is not an isolated project or the reduction of car parking is the result of this project is not isolated it 's it 's councillors were would recall a straight scape master class that was conducted within in 2017 just regarding the theory of streets street development obviously members of the public were also invited and attended to that and I guess the background behind that is in general we 're wanting people to park outside of key areas and walking in those kcpt areas this provides social benefit also provides health benefits and there is also economic benefit to that as well as mentioned above what we 're looking at doing or the theory behind it is more parking outside those key areas and then improving the amenities for pedestrians to make use of that that 's a location more walkable safer and enjoy that CBD area other key points are the timing of the petition so the design for this work would design for this project was done around 2016 the tender itself was advertised in July 2018 and awarded at the September 2018 council meeting and the works have actually commenced on that as of 1st of February so there 's obviously an Associated cost with having to see if there needs to be considered and the fourth point was just around the engagement and just to clarify that there was significant engagement conducted as part of the design process we acknowledged that there was feedback received that there were some people opposed to the reduction of car parking or removal of some car parking there were also comments though it was also feedback supporting that and it 's or even more reduction of more car parking there were changes but made based on that car parking so they were sorry based on that feedback so there was additional parking added to the to the north side of the street aside from that prior to engagement of the tender there was a walk around with the plans with with local business owners in that area and information was sent to the bestowal Chamber of Commerce and Industry explaining the theory behind it and what was happening so in summary we understand that removing car parking from directly in front of businesses can be perceived negatively but we believe the concept is sound there are benefits to the entire project as well a good level of community engagement and just with regards to the timing of the position the cost of changing it at the moment I guess the the time to object was was prior to engagement of the tender and and through that design process so the recommendation provided and I 'm happy to answer any questions question councillors councillor retainer um I know you have explained this before but um just can 't remember the the net outcome for disability parking in that area and and parking for elderly in that general project at the moment there are no Sokol car parks and there 's the installation of one disabled car park but I 'll kiss acknowledging that those parks you know there is a small number of parks within an area and it 's 20 years the total zone one in 20 councillor pelts in regards to that in regards to that where are we going to put the the bulk of those car parks that were closest to the shops as short-term 50 minute parking allotments for the elderly to get in and get out and then was because I remember standing in the mall with Fiona and some of the staff when they were talking to the community on that day about this project and it was something that was flagged at that stage that those car parks along that Street should be prioritized to the people that were elderly and had more of a disability than others so I was just curious as to whether that 's what the outcome is identified the whole principle around CBD is if you have your short-term parking and your disability parking close in and then you stagger it out so that you get to all-day parking which is where our workers should be parking and walking in so that 's certainly the philosophy that will be applied to this parking I think someone is it 's half our parking is that is the shortest we 're going because that allows some of our more elderly residents to get in and out of cars and and get to the shops and then we go out to to our parking and then beyond Pike Street is where we go to this point that there 's also been an net increase in the number of car parks in that precinct generally while series are lost in this particular part of the street overall in that precinct we 've got a net increase of I think it 's in the report but there 's you know I think it 's up around 20 additional car parks so there will be additional car parks in that precinct overall so that 's what mr. Richards was alluding to when he said we needed to look at this entirety because it within the precinct there is actually an increase in parking not a decrease thanks miss rival councillors okay thanks Council perhaps if there 's no other questions thanks counselor Toria for seconding speakers I 'd just like to say to the community and this was has been a long-term project it 's part of a is it a three or a four stage project of bends Dale streetscape beautification yes stage three and you can see the benefits from the earlier stages of what we have implemented and it 's another stage so it stages and it was done really sensibly and kindly to the community with their with their input and I have to say I was a part of that and I did take the time to go and stand down there on a Friday and chat to the community and get amongst them and with the staff and if they had concerns and talked with them with the appropriate offices so I have to say I was a part of this I 'm actually quite accepting of what we 're trying to do here and and I don 't see that there is I think for the big the ultimate purpose it is actually beneficial so whilst we 're saying we may have lost car parks who have also gained them me so net loss is minimal so okay I 'm happy to move the recommendation thanks counselor pouts no speakers against all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you thanks mr. Richards item two notices of motion or rescission mr. CEO Neil have been received madam an item three deferred business also no okay item for Council of reports sent in there was three three P seems that that we 've done in the last month but the the the item that I 'd like to speak on just very briefly is another opening that I did at the East Gippsland art gallery Evolutionary and remembered landscapes it was something that I quite enjoyed as I do every time doing an opening at our gallery it 's wonderful to see our community asset and when I say our I do believe it belongs to everybody and I would invite anybody that wants to go see some good art to to go to the the shows that are on at the moment some very good art from local artists and very reasonably priced I thought so thank you thanks counselor to a counselor retainer and I think you matter me I 've submitted my report I 've just have a couple of things that I 'd like to mention the first one was the the Gippsland smart specialization strategy which we had a meeting with yourself and representatives from that organization which is a Melbourne University research undertaken by the specialization with Gippsland it 's a powerful regionalization model used by many successful regions in Europe and during an East Gippsland stakeholder engagement that opportunity arose where they actually spoke to us because they want to speak to the whole of Gibson engaged all of Gibson in relation to this not just the local governments that are part of the Latrobe Valley Authority but in developing this smart specialization strategy they 'll go through five stages of analysis of the regional potential the governance framework around the collaboration designing a shared vision for future and setting the priorities an action plan around the implementation and then the monitoring and evaluation of how it do it is the aim is the project we 'll explore design and test a Gippsland specialization model reference group called gs3 for the Latrobe Valley Authority drawing explicitly on the principle of Co design with regional stakeholders the key objective in building a community building on community strengths and capability for the future leveraging collaboration and innovation growing industry competitiveness social cohesion and ecological sustainability the other outcome will the other outcomes will clearly identify capabilities and competencies needed to ensure sustainable job creation and retention partnership brokering and networking to support innovation sustainable projects to demonstrate and trial this strategy so a really important piece of work that 's happening in our region at the moment the other thing that I just like to quickly mention is around the a scripts a marketing series of business breakfasts it 's an opportunity for people to go along and actually see the business that 's hosting that particular breakfast the last one was held at slep architects in grand style along with simon edison consulting consulting engineers and I strongly encourage other councils to get along to those breakfasts series and broaden knowledge around the different businesses that make up our community and lastly because the mallacoota students are here I 'd probably like to encourage them to look at the arthur grocery Kokoda scholarship opportunity that 's open to all secondary students in a Skip 's land and it 's it 's a scholarship that actually supports several students to go to this on this annual Kokoda Track and learn a lot about what happened there yeah it 's a real opportunity to get involved as part of that leadership and it was fantastic to hear from the young people that have actually done the walk and how it 's actually changed their lives and the leadership things that they took away from actually doing the Kokoda thank you madam me thanks counselor retainer council the raves thanks mayor good afternoon everyone it 's lovely to be back here in mallacoota in the rain so if we can just share that across the state please there 's a few events that I 've been lucky enough to participate in and represent Council on in the last month but I 'll just draw your attention to one in particular and that is the great role that I have on the large ACK the local Aboriginal justice advisory committee and currently just for your information he skips land is the only local government authority in Gippsland that is represented on a large ACK or a rojack across the whole of Gippsland and participation in the large ACK is much more than just symbolic it 's about having a with the likes of big Pole Department of Justice Victorian legal service legal aid and so on and that 's that 's really important for us to be able to be represented around that table terribly important and conversely and reciprocally it 's important that I can carry back from that group to the council group the importance of that representation through meetings like this it 's really very important and what I was asking and for example being able to represent the message from gawak jejak Muji that our rap is important our reconciliation action plan is important and it 's a it 's a very strong message that we as a council can provide to be a truly inclusive organization but mayor I 'm wondering and CEO on if I can ask you on behalf of the large ACK could you make representations at GLG n and our colleagues there that the other Gippsland local governments could also consider having councilor represents representation on logic and Rajic because of the importance of and that 's the message I would like to convey this afternoon thanks counselor waves Kent thank you thanks counselor Roberts councillor Buckley yeah thank you madam mayor recently we had a meeting at the Emil Historical Society and a bit concerned they asked several times for the piling friends facing the road be repaired and it all out you replaced actually with a new fence and they asked me to bring that up I don 't know whether I believe it already has come through Chris that issue and the passing of Billy Flanagan has that been mentioned or hasn 't come across Mike yes but have we done something about that he was a former president we did we fixed it up did we okay thank you madam me that 's all I have to report thanks counselor Buckley counselor Ellis thank you madam a very little just like to welcome everyone here today for our meeting here at Miller CUDA the first days um reminded us since 1997 um I 'm just gonna run through a cup of quick things very quickly attended the Australian paper manufacturers launch of their feasibility study and the waste of energy project in Gippsland for the minister of the members of our community questioned to hear today my further attended planning consultation project meetings for a number of projects are in the shower and partook in the annual AGM and workshops of the rail alliance I 'll leave it at that thank you thanks counselor counselor watt thank you madam mayor just one item I 'd like to speak about was last week in um in conjunction with Crimestoppers Victoria police and and these hips and forming an alliance to to the community to DA being a drug dealer very important messages there for our community that no matter how small a house insignificant you think of something you have seen please make the authorities aware because that will put all this together and possibly will will prosecute drug dealers because we need to preserve our young people and I just urge you all to be very vigilant thank you thanks counselor Wyatt counts the pelts thanks very much madam me my report comes from a grassroots level I am a grassroots counselor and I think my report sort of reflects that and I 'd like to just recently I 've been down in Melbourne chatting with other peers other councillors and they said oh how many people attend your meetings and I said regularly we 're getting a lot so 30 people adding this from this community is quite a big faction of people attending so we thank you all for participating today and joining us because quite often my other peers reflect and they say we don 't get anyone at our meetings so we must be doing something of interest for you all to be turning up so with that said East Gippsland hot dry spell although ironically it is raining right now it continues and the little rain that we 've had has quickly been evaporated not lasting long enough for any decent crop growth to be of significance the talk around the region from the older focus that we have had haven 't seen dry times such as this before in their years so I 'm talking to people in their 80s and 90s and they 're virtually saying we 've not seen it as dry as ever across the whole of holistic of the whole region so when we 're talking drought funding we 're not just talking about Lyndon a or all boss 'd or you know buckin all we 're talking the whole region so the funding that we 're talking about might be a million dollars it doesn 't go very far when it comes to having to service the whole of our region the twenty to twenty thousand hectares that we actually cover so and I 'm not sure going on further where February went but I can honestly say it went in a flash and I 'm now in the thought that the world is speeding up and getting quicker because February came and went January came and went and into me we 're now in March and we are well and truly into 2019 and thus far I have to say it 's not been an easy start for many any skips man at grassroots level for many waking up in the morning and looking at the window to see no rain on the horizon no grass to feed their animals little growth in their to buy groceries and how are we going to pay for those bills on the other hand we others are waking up in the morning to the smell of smoke smoke on the horizon and bush fires not far away exactly the same scenario up here in mallacoota we find that the inlet we 've arrived and we we weren 't actually aware of this and we 've arrived on your doorstep to find that you 've been struggling with the the s3 being closed for some three months now and you 're actually dealing with inundation so with that said the council group and I are looking at proposing something which might help you later in this meeting and I hope that it will satisfy your outlet the outcomes so these are the heartfelt feelings of many people in our community who have never faced something like this before in their lives the real truth is this scenario is the drought it 's the it 's the bush fires and it 's the inundation we are copying conditional unusual conditional condition that we are actually not we haven 't two Theo used to come we 'll be saying as old-timers we 'll be saying it 's the 1819 drought or the fire that we remember but I question what have we learned from it all quite ironically last week I traveled to Melbourne to attend the Victorian transport infrastructure summit and I have to say I was very underwhelmed about the whole thing it was organized by the Vic Minister for transport and infrastructure the Honorable just into Alan and I say I was underwhelmed because they 're talking about million and billion dollar projects happening in and around Melbourne and yes it will help the connectivity of our communities traveling down there but there was nothing absolutely nothing no upgrades to anything in our region and when I did question about how they propose to improve the rail service to the East Gippsland errs I was looked at with big eyes and virtually how dare you talk about the elephant in the room certainly the talk around our region there 's no stimulus jobs for us in fact the timber industry is the next thing to go and it and we 've just had timber renewals of timber industry contracts only three months ago for the contracts are for a five-year period and only three months later they 're looking the state government is actually talking about payouts for those people that have just received five-year terms to their contracts these committed hard-working people are being replaced with a walking track from the air and under plateau to cape conran whilst this sounds quite pleasant I do believe the two can actually exist side-by-side and they should be respectful of the timber industry and the processes that they do I don 't want to go to Bunnings or to douse ins and buy timber that 's imported from the Portuguese or from anywhere else in the world that doesn 't have such great harvesting methodologies as what we have here in Australia to me I look at it and I think what is the point of actually buying timber from overseas that the practices are actually endangering world class rainforests and basically I find it actually hard to take I say the two should exist side-by-side with 75% sense to me that the only people who should be able to have decent wages should live in Erbil being Melbourne and that us in the outer herbs should be satisfied with being the playground region for those who fancy visiting every now and again truly state gather government answer me this what makes a community sustainable on its own merit and you should drive for this it would be less draining on the economy and its resources and on a happier note I 'd like to finish with a good news story from the or boss community and I 'm delighted to say that in response to the drought relief for the farmers of the region the old boss branch of the CWA is starting up again and they 're due to have their first meeting Wednesday night tomorrow night and I personally like to wish them all the best and I 'll be joining them because I strongly believe in the basis of the CWA and their community that they represent and that can includes my report thank you madam me thanks counselor pouts I 'll just quickly a busy month again and I 'll just focus on the drought because we 've had a lot of meetings with several politicians who have visited the region in the last couple of weeks we 've had minister for agriculture Jacqueline thiam 's come down when she announced the state government 's drought package and she spoke with a few farmers in the almost area we also had prime minister Scott Morrison and the Federal Minister for agriculture David a little proud and our federal member forgive slander and Chester come to brag along and speak with a large number of farmers in relation to the impact the drought is having on them and the sorts of funding and assistance they need we he also spoke to the premier and would been reinforcing the need for rate relief as that 's the most common assistance or sorts of assistance that we are hearing from our farmers and we had a drought reference group meeting yesterday which our federal member Diane Chester also attended to and we 're really looking at ways that we can help to make sure that the meets the needs of our community and on the ground so I 'll leave it at that Thank You officer reports 5.1.1 I love kinder federal advocacy campaign miss Nelson thank you madam mayor this report sex councils support for the I love kinder campaign which has been designed to advocate to the federal government in the lead-up to the upcoming election to seek their continuation of funding for I got their contribution to what has been known as four-year-old kindergarten but it 's now kind of being known as the year before school part of the kindergarten education system so since 2013 all of the the federal government and state and territory governments have all contributed to jointly fund 15 hours of kindergarten a week for every child so as a universal service and the federal government contributes 3 of that funding in the May 2018 budget the federal coalition government said that it would cut funding for the kindergartens after December 2019 so after the end of this year and the impact of that is that it would result in families needing to find an estimated two thousand children can access that early years education provided by kindergarten the evidence that 's available in terms of the value of investing in early education is quite extensive and very well recognized and it 's something that we believe is really important for a community like a skips land where the ability for families to afford to access what is essentially an optional education part of the education system is actually you know the ability to afford that is often not the reality for many families so counsel escape sunshine doesn 't run kindergarten services but we certainly have a role in providing the facilities that are used to run those services and we have a role in planning for the way that we achieve really great outcomes for families and young people in this community as a in a strategic sense work in collaboration with a whole range of organizations which from this report you can see are all very supportive of funding for kindergarten services so on that basis the recommendation from officers is that council does join in in this campaign which is being promoted by the that we make our views known in the lead up to the federal election so that there can be some resolution of guaranteed funding for kindergarten services happy to answer questions questions councillors councillor to II thank you for moving councillor retain a second any speakers for the motion to e yes I 'm happy to move this recommendation the aside from the the benefit that our community gets that the two to four times the cost at the time later down the track and if I may I 've got some information here regarding research that 's been done and shows that these children have a smoother transition to primary school have better social and cognitive skills compared to children who do not attend kinder on average have superior literacy and numeracy once they 're at school in school and beyond young people who attend kinder remain ahead of those who don 't attend are more likely to finish year 12 and on average experience higher levels of employment financial security health and well-being and I think that 's just a terrific outcome and we should be supporting this want to would like to support councillor to his comments absolutely understand the value of affordable kinder but for a region like ours which is highlighted in the sefer index for disadvantaged even more important and yeah I wholeheartedly I 'm second in summation councillor pouts I 'd like to speak in support of the motion and just stating I recall when the federal government bought this initiative in some five six years ago and we actually were struggling on how we were going to implement this and then I sort of find it a bit bizarre that you know sort of not for not far down the track they 're actually trying to get out of paying the funding for it and it 's very minimal compared with the benefits and I believe it 's something there their contribution to society and they should they should fulfil it so yes let 's keep enforcing this and pushing the wheelbarrow on it absolutely thanks council up helps any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you item 5.2.1 planning permit application two subdivision at 33 jerem on the road almost miss mr. Sadler has a would like to speak sorry thank you thank you madam mayor councillors the opportunity to speak to this application on behalf of my clients Ellen and Lorraine Brown long term residents of almost disappointingly the first line that I 'd like to bring to council 's attention after the offices report which I 'm hopefully you 've you 've all read and been able to comprehend and read between the lines it 's an energetic report which the officer put as much energy into it granting approvals he does knock them back I 'd I 'd be first to applaud him the line says although the scheme may allow for the application to be made it is argued the outcome is contrived one that seeks to utilize a planning provision not intended to result in the creation of rural residential lifestyle allotments we already have a rural residential allotment it 's 10 hectares it 's not this isn 't being created by this application this application as I 've written in the first line of my report dwelling from the rural component of the land as a low-lying area is considered to be surplus to the needs of the current owners my clients have been attempting to dispose of this property for a number of years and the reluctance has been for the market to meet anywhere near fair market value when you consider that eight and a half hectares of this land is absolutely prime agricultural land and if you looked on things about page 28 of the officers report you 'll see an image where we actually show the area of land which is subject to inundation and prime or bus flats if this property was in linden art be it would be zoned farming zone scheduled for and you would have subdivision allotments minimum size of one hectare by a quirk of planning for some reason your boss flats does not have that particular at the zoning further on we are not attempting as I say to promote any form of further development on the agricultural part of this property which narrows eight and a half odd hectares and we 've actually noted that create a lot one of approximately 1.3 5 hectares and whilst lot 2 will be less than the minimum lot size which if you don 't know it 's 40 hectares for this zone specified under schedule under the farms and it will know it 'll enable a future purchaser to make better use of fertile land which is currently under utilized there is no expectation that proposed lot too will grow a dwelling I think the officers report in suggesting we 're creating multiple rural residential rural residential lifestyle allotments is so so misleading that we 're just trying to break away and get into the marketplace the primary agricultural land rather than give expectation to additional dwellings any additional dwelling on an eight-and-a-half hectare property even if council borough mind sorry Council are able to police the absolute control of whether a dwelling could even be applied for and you are in absolute control and in granting this particular permit one of the conditions of council could do is actually impose a section 173 agreement on the eight-and-a-half hectare rural parcel which suggests if you want the permit land with a dwelling you could have it appropriate rural outbuildings which you know there 's area on the land for that of a shed or whatever but if cancer were of a mind to grant this application the the concept is you would you could have a belts and braces approach and impose a one seven three but you already have the planning scheme controls and and we 're it 's it 's for those people who don 't know where the property is this is about 50 metres from where you 've just raised owned the property owned by or by civil and civic or the weather or family to low density reliever a living zone development coming coming boundary road it is not a remote rural parcel and it is not an intention to create a low-density residential parcel it already exists what we 're doing is breaking away and freeing up in a fair market approach eight eight and a half hectares of prime agricultural land which it 's easy to say could be done by boundary alignment and added into an adjoining our neighbor but we 're saying in its proximity to the township where someone could literally have some sort of cash crop coming out of or bus you know some vegetable or even a decent horse paddock in that prenup precinct it could be easily acquired and and and when all bust is crying out for some form of lifeblood to have an expansive report take a straight down the path that we 're promoting the creation of rural residential allotments counter to all of the state policies I I 've been doing this job for long enough that I would not let and embarrass my clients by starting an application which was fundamentally flawed I know the rules I know that you 're not meant to take land out of rural production and here we are we 're trying to put land back into rural production and I get a tie rate of about a controller thank you madam a question councillor Roberts thank you madam at is for mrs. Sadler so your client would be willing to engage in a section 173 agreement to restrict the use of the subdivided land mind and I 'm I come to this forum plenty of times over myself uh through my office and we 're always trying to get rid of won 7-3 agreements which are there forever this is one where you don 't need it because you actually can apply for a planning if someone applied for a planning permit council has all the powers to say no we won 't grant the permit however if you wanted that certainty my clients would absolutely be prepared to take it if it means that can break the impasse of how they free up a very well presented home from a piece of land which I 'm not a real estate value but it 's not an insignificant amount of money and we 're trying to find someone who wants both bits and then we just can 't find that person so if the price is a 1 7 3 gram they have to pay so be it this is for director Holton can you please remind the gallery what what rights a land owner would have in the rural farming zone in regards as a right for someone to be able to develop a dwelling on an allotment of 40 hectares or 100 acres any under anything under that would require a planning permit application to be submitted so this falls less than 100 acres so the landowner would not be able to build without a planning permit they would have the right to apply for a planning permit to erect a dwelling and then that would be considered on its merits Thank You councillor Phelps had a question yes I do with regards to this and I 'm not sure whether it 's Paul or Michael but I can see what the applicant is wanting to do here and and I do feel for them because the bulk of the land or the whole lot of the land is is farms owned and it is on the fringe of the Oh boss Township it is acceptable that that portion that they 're wishing to subdivide off could actually be his own load density residential or even rural living zone which is over the Rhone and abuts it anyway what 's the process applicant wants to achieve do they actually subdivide the block off and then get it rezoned or is it actually zoned first because the bottom half of this block the majority of the block that they 're leaving as mr. Sadler said is actually prime farms owned and it is in a deep and it 's a section that actually floods the section where the house is I know it very well because we almost perch stood at one stage but it actually would merit that it had opportunity to have probably three three you know subdivisions on the house section that they 're proposing and it would still fit within the the rural living zone the low-density residential zone category if it was subdivided even later on so does it it 's a bit like the chicken in the egg does the egg come first or the chicken do you subdivide the block off and rezone it or do you rezone it and then subdivide it off but you can 't go back to it to the farm zone section thank you for the question counselor Pilsen yes it us is an application for subdivision and we must consider the application on that basis any subsequent application for rezoning would be would necessarily be subject to a completely separate application process and and that and the merits of that proposal would need to be put forward at that time and and again that would be that would be considered on its merits as well so at this stage there is a proposal for a subdivision it did not at the time it was submitted contain a any reference to section 1 3 agreement prohibiting further development on that on that piece of land that 's one of the considerations that ivory on reading the report that the planning officer has has taken into account and has ultimately arrived at their recommendation to put forward a refusal thank you councillor white um address this to you more if occur and we 're saying that its prime agricultural land it 's actually only a small parcel of land that 's probably not being utilized because of its size so therefore would be my thoughts that if it was purchased by a of its production as it stands now which would be an advantage in other words it would be more produced offered if it was excised or amalgamated with another property and the people were able to live just in their home close to town councillor what I think the the almost real estate market over the journey has suggested to my clients that to try and find someone who wants a home of the quality and also wants to work another 20 20 odd acres of fertile country the to that marriage isn 't being found and so the the consequence is their senior in years they other basically offer it up at bargain basement and and it 's just the the the realistic value is never never received and I know in the planning scheme it says subdivision isn 't meant to be a form of super map of reward for superannuation it 's says that and I 'm well aware of it but there 's a point and I take counselor pals point you don 't do by rezoning what you can do with a simple planning permit whole property in the area through a rezoning to achieve what a single planning permit application could achieve with regards to councillor Roberts one seven three agreement proposal would have been able to would we be able to put our won 7-3 agreement that that that portion that was around the house a smaller lot number one be reasoned into low-density residential and the rest of the farm remained the same because that 's what I actually think they 're trying to achieve I 'm wondering whether a 173 agreement would be appropriate for an outcome such as that look I I 'm advised that that wouldn 't be that wouldn 't be appropriate in this in in in this as part of this this application or I think the what 's being referred to in respect of the one seven three agreement is really [Music] putting in place a legal agreement that runs on title that prevents the development of a house on the balance lot on the larger allotment so that it wouldn 't be seen as being some sort of you know like subsequent breaking up of to speak and that 's all that 's being talked about thanks counselor ratinho thanks madam mayor um along the lines of what wear counts I think where councillor Roberts was going mr. Halton would you have an alternate motion or recommendation prepared with a 173 agreement what would that look like as it happens councillor ratinho we we are prepared with such a alternative motion and my colleague Aaron hollow is is prepared to come up and speak to that if you don 't mind we just had one more question before I get mr. Hawley councillor Roberts thank you madam mayor just one final point of clarification because the land that would be subdivided the excised land would still remain in the farming zone and it would fall less than 100 acres it would not be able to be built on without a planning application and for planning application was received it would likely be refused because the zoning overlay so there for us 173 agreement probably isn 't necessary either because we could consider it at a later date that correct well I I think that 's of a property would do just that he 's still the owner of the land would still be able to apply for a planning permit application and to build a house and as we like to think we would generally not preempt an outcome of a planning permit application that has not been made at this stage so whilst you know I take on border observation that you may consider it but all planting permit applications are considered on their merits and at any at the time that they 're made so there is also obviously if 173 agreement is placed on the land to prevent that that 's that coming forward and application can also be made to remove a one seven three agreements so in any case there is a variety of checks and balances there that that don 't sterilize land completely for any particular purpose thanks counselor Roberts councillor retainer yeah look I 'm keen on the one seven three agreement because if mr. Sadler 's likening this land similar to the Linda no flats it needs to be protected I mean at some stage that an acre Michael so I think the only way we can protect it is and achieve what 's in front of us today is around the 173 agreement with any surety Council the race mr. Holdren ought to seek clarification in the report it does actually mention that the application does not include consolidation of land with adjoining farmland and does not support the imposition of a section 173 legal agreement that was the officers reading of the application and and subsequently that is the officers what the officer has included in this report by way of clarification to that point I 'd take it back to a discussion I can say mr. hallow and myself had before deputy president Gibson advocate where she pointed us both in the chest and said why do you need of a 173 agreement if the planning scheme already tells you you 've got control under the under the planning scheme to consider the permit Council it 's a final order on that permit and then obviously the appeal process so it 's my personal view and long-standing that you don 't enter into the planning scheme as the same as don 't resume Gregory 's own land for something ignore do under a planning permit however if it means for clarity we want to 7 through agreement the clients prepared to have it but the genesis in my report which is where it started was I don 't want a 1 7 3 agreement as a matter of principle just for housekeeping purposes if the planning scheme doesn 't ask for it Thank You mr. Sadler mr. hallo would you please come and speak to the report thank you madam mayor councillors obviously there 's a report in front of you and I can see that there has been considerable homework done in relation to the reading of that report and its outcomes I would simply suggest to councillors that this application is an ad what we would refer to as an ad hoc subdivision it 's the subdivision to exercise of dwelling in a farming zoned area where we 're creating a situation where there could be adverse impacts to other agricultural enterprises that surround this property I go to your questions mr. Weatherall chose to create a rural living zoned development he went through a process of planning scheme amendment he justified that application he was able to demonstrate that the land was suitable for that purpose he was able to also provide a planning permit application with the rezoning to be read in conjunction and that we were able to make sure the appropriate servicing was provided to the land this proposal and I do take the point there can be some difficulties in certain markets but this application looks like an ad hoc outcome from planning perspective there is no strategic reason why we would allow for the further excision of a small lock with in a farming zone to take place and that 's based on the planning policy within our planning scheme never nevertheless counselors you asked me to the table team particularly talked to the section 173 agreement and I 've with my officers due diligence they 've prepared an alternative recommendation for your consideration and that particular condition condition it would be number two of may be an alternative motion that might get moved here a statement of compliance is issued the owner must enter into agreement with the responsibility under Section 1 7 3 underplaying environment Act to provide for the filing a lot to must not be used or developed for the purpose of a dwelling and the owner must pay costs of the preparer preparing lodging and registering the agreement and a subsequent amendment removal or other dealing associated with the agreement and the agreement must be registered on the certificate of title for the land I would proffer counsel that in my view and we have moved on from that decision where mr. so there are myself competing in front of VCAT to discuss it we have moved on and some of the research that we 've noticed in particular with subdivisions in the farming zone that is that where there 's an underlying policy that states that we should not be allowing for fragmentation of agricultural land but should the council determine that it is the best use for this land that you should prevent the ballast allotment becoming a further rural living allotments and I would proffer that it because it gives any subsequent owner that purchase of the land a clear understanding that this land is not a rural living block it is a farming lot or farming lot and that it 's use is for farming purposes and not for the purposes of a dwelling so I would think it 's a better outcome both from any future purchaser may be getting the wrong idea about what they can do on the land but it also adds to the argument that some councillors have said today about that if it gets aggregated well hopefully gets angry into a larger land holding for the purposes of farming and I think that 's a good good outcome and that 's why I 'd argue for the agreement to be put in place rather than not to be put in place thank you Thank You mr. hollow are there any further questions from councillors counselor 2e would that section 173 and maybe Paul asking you in regards to the section 173 if that if that allotment were joined to joining an adjoining allotment sorry I forget the term there would section 173 agreement and what potential implications could there be for that moving forward so if the if the block of land were were amalgamated or broad it brought into into the one ownership with another larger block of land and and that resulted in a larger farming allotment being being available that was that that that there would be some sort of strategic and good solid reason for removing the 173 agreement preventing the development of a dwelling on it then that that case would need to be made at the time so they would have the trigger to be able to do that on the basis that there was a change in circumstances and it may be that if it was he said whoever bought it amalgamated with a lot that brought it up through the minimum lot size then that would provide some kind of reasonable justification for a application to come forward to remove their won 7-3 agreement because it probably wouldn 't be appropriate in the circumstance canceller Pelt 's there 's an epitaph to not support the recommendation and if that was the case the the process would be that if that if that motion the cut the current recommendation of the officers is not supported then the the officers have prepared an alternative motion for the counselors that is the the opposite to this motion that actually you made several copies did you Eric yeah very good counselor why further question this question is to you Michael so if this is an alternative motion your clients would have to be in agreeance with that would they know further questions counselors cancel the Roberts I 've got a question it 's one of the dot point three is requesting that the owner of the land must enter into agreements with relevant authorities for the provision of water drainage sewerage electricity and gas to each lot if there 's a 173 agreement being imposed to prevent a dwelling being built why would you require those services to be provisioned there 's a management requirement as part of the planning scheme to put that condition down the two-light subdivision the fact is that the the agreement might be with the authorities there is no agreement any alternative I 'm happy to move the alternative motion but there 's a I really want to see this application go through because I think it 's a very fair and reasonable request and I think the officers have done an extremely thorough job my only concern is I sort of I agree with the with the proponent and I believe the 173 is potentially unnecessary based on the size of the subdivision however if we can get it across the line I 'm happy to support it so thank you councillor retainer you hope you do a second I 'm happy to second it with the 173 section remaining unit so I think it 's valuable farmland needs to be protected just like a bit of clarification of the request here you 're requesting for in the alternative motion for sewage drainage and sewage and all of that the house is at itself is actually not our mains it 's on main water but it 's on septic tank and so for I think it 's an unreasonable asked to be actually asking for the series to be put 's about a 60 square house you could run let 's get up the hallway it 's a very big house and I understand those people 's requests that I actually believe it should be resigned as low density residential number lot number one and I don 't know where if we can write that into this at the bottom section lot number two is actually stays in rural living no farm zone but lot number one be raised owned so if I could take your first question that 's a mandatory requirement of the planning scheme in a two lot subdivision so you have to put that condition down with every two lot subdivision but in going to the authorities the authorities can say it 's not a sewer district we haven 't got sewer the agreement is you don 't need an agreement with us to sue over land so authorities take a reasonable approach but but we must put it down in terms of your second question should we can 't_''_5693.7 mix the two streams of planning you 've got the statutory side which this has been the strategic side the resigns land should the owner of the exercise dwelling wish to see their landries owned they 're more than welcome to put forward a private planning scheme a moment to seek to rezone their land and they 'll be required to go through all the strategic justification to do so but it wouldn 't fit and it will be right to mix the two things in a statutory document as a planning permit it 's something that the applicant would not be in control of can I ask on that basis would they be able to then sell that property as a farm zone what number one on its own merit yes counts the Roberts one more small one from me just a point of clarification in regards to 0.3 again so just to clarify if a hypothetically if a farming block in the hills well separated away from any residential land if that was if there was an application to subdivide put through say Castle burn would that still be subject to the 2.3 yes it would that it 's a it 's a reasonable that you 've got the ability to provide services if they 're available often they 're not available so I understand entirely the premise of your question but it 's reasonable to make sure that the end user after a subdivision isn 't having to pick up all those costs councillor ease mr. hollow there 's no suggestion there 's going to be provision of optic fiber cable out there is there I think you 're very correct counselor but once again the to lessen the burden on the telecommute telecommunication agencies they made a planning scheme amendment that said whenever you 're subdividing land you must put these mandatory conditions down on any permit this issue so it might be hard for the proponent to prove that there 's no suggestion of a provision of an optic fibre cable there absolutely not if there 's no other questions we 've got the amended motion before us sorry we 'll have to vote on that so all those in favor do we have a seconder councillor chair thank you yep all those in pay can we just run over the around yes so we 're voting on that to become the substantive motion yep so so always in favor so counselor Ellis is yes okay so the motion now becomes the substantive motion so are there any further speakers yes so do we have a mover for this motion now councillor Roberts thank you second council Pelt 's no further speakers for the motion all those in favor motion carried unanimously thank you mr. Hawley five point three point one Warren being a studio gallery funding application Thank You mr. Morton thanks better be councilors before he was a application that council received from the Warren bina heart studio he likes entrance this subsequently was assessed by counsels economic development advisory board the application is such that it 's seeking contribution of 50,000 from councils economic discretionary fund for the establishment or assisting with the establishment of the already existing art gallery lights entrance around indigenous art if councillors are aware the gallery is on my street Dan likes entrance they the de marrón bina studio actually received funding from karate Victoria and since then have had a number of that space from the indigenous community so like centers being the second largest Aboriginal population in the state they were lucky enough to secure a three lease three-year lease on the premises Danny likes and this the the grant if approved our contribution from council would go towards fitting out of the shop front to make it little bit more appealing and also some installation of lighting and some other art hanging space inside the facility itself so the application was approved by council second element Advisory Board and it 's before consideration Thank You mr. Martin are there any questions from councillors councillor pouts I 'm just curious about the discretionary fund because we were we had X amount of money overturned period and you delegated a bit of the funding out and committed it over a series of years is that right what 's happened and so we actually have we actually do have 15,000 to be offering this group as a one-off payment because I thought we were sort of up to our limit on on what we were spending it on things to your question so councils commercial right so that that figure goes into that discretionary fund per year so at the moment yes there is any other questions no thanks counselor tyno councillor raves second any further speakers councillor tanner thanks met Emir I didn 't courage people to go and have a look at this fantastic facility in my street I think it 's the start of putting some life back into my street it 's fantastic having the art available for our tourists and I encourage people to visit it thank you Thank You councillor rage thanks mayor this is another great addition to the diversity of our and culture of our particular area so bring it on thank you okay put the motion to you all those in favor motion carried unanimously five point four point one report on audit and Risk Committee meeting held on 26th of February 2019 we 'll just move over to five point four point two proposed special council meeting to consider rural councils I know that 's Mary Ann as well five point four point three implements an implementation of the drought communities program extension to authorize project procurement miss Nelson thank you madam and it 's the longest report title I think we 've had in a while sorry I don 't need to tell Council and the community that you know we 're dealing with drought in East Gippsland that 's the reality that means that we have an opportunity as councils know to apply for a million dollars to put towards some projects that are designed to really encourage economic activity and to benefit the community longer term through the provision of infrastructure we 've made application for that million dollars and in that there are two quite substantial projects that we 'd like to progress the reality is this funding comes with some very tight timeframes to achieve and while while we will do our very best to make sure those timeframes are achieved what we 're looking for here is a change to the current financial delegations to the chief executive officer for these particular projects there 's quite specific projects to be approved for contracts to be approved by the CEO so that we can progress the procurement processes for for these two projects only it 's not a change to the delegations in any other way purely and simply to make sure that we can deliver these projects as efficiently as possible thanks miss Nelson questions councillors okay thanks counselor Tina counselor raves second speakers madam a thank you just briefly it 's really important this type of infrastructure and the way we 're spending it is the knock-on effect of drought affects local economies using local contractors to do this type of work keeps money spinning around in our economy nothing more nothing less thank you Thanks okay councillor Roberts yeah I 'd like to speak in support of the motion and I just also like to point out people that have been following in media around some concerns around councils intention on this grandma just on how to spend this grant money and as was alluded to before we come from a very large Shire and there 's not a whole but this is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things so if it 's very true it 's very hard to you do give it directly to the farmers they don 't really get a whole lot so you need to try and stimulate the industry in some way and the councillor group are working extremely hard to try and brainstorm and find more effective ways in a long term and how we can progress and I know madam mayor has been doing great work in this front to give support to our drought affected community members and farmers so it 's not just a free livestock extreme exchange upgrade there 's a lot more to it than that and we 're working extremely hard to try and get a good outcome for the community well said councillor Roberts any further speakers put the motion to you all those in favor motion carried unanimously okay we 'll move back to five point four point one report on audit and Risk Committee meeting held on the 26th of February 2019 here thank you madam mayor and councillors as you can see from the report there was a meeting of the order and risk committee held recently the report outlines those items that some very significant audit reports we also had an update from our internal and our external auditors that it 's also covered in the report for your information the purpose of this report is really to for council to note that we held the meeting and that the minutes are available therefore for their information to Co are there any questions counselors no councillor pouts yeah only because it was part of the our baby in the first place the Rehman Island very update and the unnoticed here the committee noted that the action had been delayed due to council officers proactively commissioning an independent review of the remaining maintenance contracts to ensure the implementation controls are effective I 'm how long will that actually take to to be received miss waggle I have received the first draft of that and undertaking that person has indicated that we report early next week so it will be available at the next Audit Committee meeting that 's right review thank you further questions camp counselor he 's moved thanks counselor ratinho for a second put the motion to you all those in proposed special council meeting to consider rural councils transformation program grant funding requirement mr. CEO thank you madam mayor as you will see from the report officers are requesting a special council meeting to consider a joint project which is commonly known as the Gippsland shared services initiative there is funds available from the state government under the transforming rural councils program and this potentially has the opportunity to provide funds to realize returns prior to them what would have otherwise been occurred so it 's an opportunity to apply for funds and what we 're proposing in terms of this special council meeting is to give council laws and the staff enough time to ensure that as much information is made available to the council to make a decision around the Gippsland shared services initiative it 's been something that 's been going on for a considerable period of time prior to my commencement however we are getting to a point where we need to make a decision and by putting in this special council meeting so that we can meet the deadline of the 31st of March which maximum amount of time to consider all the information so that is what is being proposed to you today councillor Paterno do you have a question yes to the CEO the CEO is this a no-go decision meeting either yes commitment or no through you madam mayor Councillor yes it is it is essentially a crunch time for for this council to determine whether it wishes to proceed and be part of this process hence why we are requesting the special meeting to allow the maximum amount of time to get a briefing from KPMG who are currently undertaking an update of the business plan and some of the analysis as well as on your way I feel like someone was just doing rabbit ears behind me so it is crunch time and it 's important that councils have enough information so as because this is a significant decision for the council and for our staff council retainer so just to follow up questions to see it have you seen any of the work from the this new consultant because I asked the question last time we spoke about this the way they presented their figures made it look really good for and in sort of no downside and I haven 't got the appetite for that sort of report unless it 's truly independent and truly challenges the assumptions the underlying assumptions of what is being tried to be achieved I 'm not interested but if I get a sense from yourself that it is truly going to be independent and truly challenged the assumptions then I think I urge all councillors to make sure they 're there for this special meeting further questions we have a recommendation before us do we have Thank You councillor Pelt 's thanks councillor Roberts all those in favor motion is carried unanimously thank you okay item six urgent and other business thank you madam I 'd like to propose a motion and first of all I 'd like to thank you for the hand yourself in the CEO for the advocacy work around drought my motion is in relation to drought and certainly thank you council roberts for those clarification comments in relation to the federal government grant that was recently a the mayor write to the Victorian stuff agriculture and premier Daniel Andrews so seeking urgent assistance with rate support for our East Gippsland show farming community due to severe drought conditions this request comes after further feedback from our farming community that this type of assistance is the most equitable assistance we can provide at this time the farming rate consideration this time should cover the twenty eighteen nineteen and twenty nineteen twenty rating fiscal years point to that we thank the Minister for agriculture for her support to date and would like to continue our dialogue with her Department as further assistance will be required as drought conditions are monitored and responded to thanks counselor do we have a seconder for that motion thanks councillor Roberts we now have that motion on the table so do we have any further speakers with a rate consideration okay well give it a consideration all right but how how was the federal government going to to do all this so just give a give us money to reduce the farm right is that well what it is which say we 've reduced to 30 or 40 percent or something calculated on the money that the federal government gives us what happens counsellor retainer did you want to clarify I 'm certainly asking for for assistance and might become clearer if I really had to speak to the rationale it 's been moved and seconded as to why sorry I 'll put it to the vote all those in favor of bringing this motion to the yeah I think I think we need to debate whether we should admitted a surgeon another business first we shall yeah yeah that 's what I was doing so counselors I 'm not too sure we should be admitting this particular notion is urgent and last-minute business councils we recall that we have discussed this matter at great length in councilor discussions over the period of time I think we 're all of the opinion that we wish to support the farmers but the issue of the rates is something that we 've we 've had a lot of angst over as such if there 's the visa unless there 's something new that 's changed our last days I don 't believe this to be urgent another business the government has been in almost of recent assisting farmers and and and this made government public statements that the government it 's looking at ways to assist the farming community I won 't attack the rationale I 'm just saying that and I just don 't see how it is urgent another business I 'd be pleased to hear any other argument to show that I 'm wrong on that thanks counselor Ellis are there any other speakers just like to say I believe it is urgent on the grounds that it is part of our it 's a very real issue for our community it 's happening now how long it 's gonna happen for we don 't know but the bottom line is it 's something if we can help our farmers and our community and assist them in getting over this trying period of course it 's urging other business so I 'll be happy to debate it on the grounds that it ease thanks counselor pouts I 'll put the motion I 'm I tend to agree with counselor Ellis I think that we have had a long and considered conversation about this that farms our take the emotion out of this that we understand that there is some difficulty there for many many farmers and businesses and we note and it has been noted that we provider effectively a 50% discount on rates to farmers over other business enterprises currently 50% discount that 's the reality and I 've had many overtures from other commercial business operators that this effectively removes them from the opportunity to have assistance as well and fifty five percent discount yeah and you would know you 're right right there thanks counselor Pell type it 's it 's very true and I just I just don 't think it 's the right thing I think the state government is acting it has provided cash grants to farmers who have discretion to use that for their rates if they wish and that hasn 't been provided for the other business enterprises who have knock-on effects of the drought at the moment and so I don 't think we this as a group we should acknowledge point to that we should thank the minister and acknowledge the work that has been done and maybe we should be asking them for in an ongoing watching brief of this matter so I don 't think we should be admitting aside I support the motion okay well I 'll put the motion to admit it into urgent other business to the vote so all of those in favor those against some motion is carried is now on the table so are there any further speakers to the motion I thank you madam e these keep saying sure council is deeply concerned about the impact that this extended dry spell is having on our farming enterprises our communities our families and associated businesses I think councillor pals earlier said earlier that it 's been speaking to some 80 year old farmers who have never seen these sorts of conditions before in their life so that that 's concerning us we don 't know when it 's going to potentially end we acknowledge that the state and Commonwealth governments have provide funds to support how community its our community that 's asking for relief around rates and that would provide them with cash injection needed to free up cash for them to reinvest in their farms the East Gippsland route reference groups reiterated this root view just this week in its latest meeting and this would represent a tangible freeing up of funds to redirect into maintaining farm operations injecting much-needed money into the local economies East Gippsland Shire Council recently collected approximately five million dollars in farm rates and the feedback continually from our community as I said earlier suggests that the hoops that people must go through to access other various assistance often prevents them from accessing that support rate relief provides a quick and easy administered way of providing that support thank you Thank You councillor tino speakers against I 'd like to speak against it no man we 're rather unprepared because we didn 't expect to be in this position this is a very difficult matter to debate because anyone who opposes it will be seen most likely it 's been quite miserable and that 's not why we rates are a middle line or baseline costing for any business farming is a business unless someone can show me it 's not I have great empathy for the farmers and the difficulties of their facing in drought what and as a member of the community we know I 'm one to support anyone that 's having difficulty the farming community of being well supported by the state government the they are supported by the federal government there 's lots of little packages going out to a system in schooling pack just clothing packages holiday packages school equipment packages counseling a whole series of things this rape rape relief is a push from one a lobby group coming through and Pat impacting upon our clear decision-making oh I get lobbied by retailers as an example as how unfair it is that they have to pay such high high rates when their businesses are suffering so I can 't see why we can 't apply a rate relief to the retailer 's of these Gippsland who are suffering strip shoppers all those sorts of different small businesses that are impacted people such should also be given great relief it 's not just one sector of the community the other issues we have to look at from an organization is management and that is hard what do we replace by not collecting at the rates what services do we hold back on what what employment do we take away from employees what negative impact does the removal of gripe monies from our local community have on our wider community this is a complex question it 's not just a simple good idea to help people who are in need we have empathy for the farmers but I see that this is not a thing we have mechanisms within the system of like a council to assist any farmer that is having difficulty with their rights whether it 's deferment of pain reduction on interest costs removal of any potential penalties associated with it provision and direction to counseling this is a really difficult thing and we 're being we 're not being honest I accept the other points as councillor mentioned where was it on point to thanking the minister and encouraging should be about encouraging the state governments and federal governments to to provide more losses and more assistance to the farmers this is we 're doing our bit and and I just believe that pushing it into the rates it 's a negative reaction to the emotive reaction coming from a lobby group that 's in inappropriately influencing this particular discussion I urge Council is not to support this concept the word rate and I did mention that to council a retainer earlier but this is a big difficulty for us all thank you madam me thanks cancer us speakers fall thank you madam mayor I 'd really like to not speak for or against but at that the issue if that 's possible you know I 've always been on about trying to reduce the rates for everybody but how far can you go do we need this special that this unusual Wells not unusual AB droughts in this country but to use this circumstance for that yeah but as counsel well assist and you can we just do this if we just do it for the farmers and know might be that 's gonna obviously upset the other right is they 're gonna say well why can 't we because we 're getting affected by the drought too because the farmers aren 't buying our stock and then the gross is the same and everybody 's in the same boat so how do we get around that you see and and we claim we need this much money to about half of what our budget is comes from the rights and we claim that we need this money to run the show so I would sort of have to vote against this in a way and try and think around it some better way of getting at this are we gonna cut our star then one of our staff members gonna say alright half a dozen the end people have got to go because we just can 't afford to keep you and well that 's my take on it anyway I can 't think I can say any more than that no thank you thanks counselor Buckley count the pelts yes sir just like to support counselor in rates for the farmers the comment that he made no I think well it 's economically viable that there would be more funding for the farmers to be paying their bills which economically it has a secondary effect to flow on to the people who are in the businesses serving the farming industry which means indirectly they do get a kickback from it so I think economically it actually does have sound merit whilst it sounds like we 're giving them opportunity it 's also economically stimulating for our region and whilst I would like to see a more equal more equal thought for the industrial people because they they do bear the burden of additional rate costs by 45 percent on top of the normal rate which is something that we use as an economic stimulus for our region I do believe by the giving the farmers these kickback that the economic stimulus is actually received at the business point too so I think it 's a double-edged thing and I can actually accept the rationale of that to be supporting this motion thanks counselor pouts counts the the discussion that look I believe that rate relief is neither quick nor easy and it 's certainly not equitable respectfully disagreeing with you counselor at E no it won 't it won 't be something you can do administer almost immediately and in fact it could be by the time the drought is over or businesses are on their recovery that this might flow on to the benefit the farmers the administration will be not easy there will be complex and it will be messy there 's no doubt about it and as I mentioned earlier it will be inequitable and as councillor Buckley so eloquently mentioned it doesn 't adequately address all people all business enterprises that are affected by the drought and the vff should be advocating for the farmers that 's their role and they should be a pressure group and we should listen to all pressure groups but not be reactive to them all otherwise we 'll have Vickie here advocating for industry and business and should we be reacting to them and providing rate relief to every business up and down the high street rate relief rates are a fixed business cost it 's a slippery path to go down for governments to be subsidizing fixed business costs we don 't provide support for their loans for their equipment their businesses their trucks or their mortgages and rates are a fixed business cost it is a very difficult area to go down and I would urge against that I 've also considered that why don 't banks who are also one of the larger organization is involved in farmers play a part and some do and I know that some of the major the big four do by request allow farmers to extend payments and to perhaps apply for interest rate reduction just as farmers can do to us if they 're struggling with their rates they can approach us and they can ask for some consideration they can ask for deferred payments they can ask for plans and that 's the sort of thing that 's the space that we occupy counselors not providing fixed business cost subsidies so this is not an appropriate thing to a space to be going into I _''_7848.44 well thanks counselor raves counselor what sorry stepping out for a bit so I 'm just a little bit behind here but I just like to say something about us assistants that had that has been given for other things in other areas and I would just like to say I think we lost 720 jobs when Hazelwood was closed I 'd like to perhaps are somebody who might know how many hundreds of millions of dollars was injected into the Latrobe Valley for that circumstance so perhaps to apportion it to so many jobs that we 've lost in our area with very little assistance coming your way thank you thank you I 'd also like to speak to the motion just to clarify a few points that were raised before that this isn 't a lobby group this is a conversation that every farmer is having with anyone and everyone well certainly at the drought reference group the events that are being held farm visits the consistent message from farmers is that rate relief is the most equitable way to assist farmers and provide some cash release as around the table over the last few weeks and everyone 's in agreeance that council simply could not cover rate relief from us so that 's why by moving this motion that we 're asking the state to provide that rate relief to ensure that we we wouldn 't have to cut services or cut employees as councillor Buckley referred to so I fully support this motion and ask you to support it also councillor ratinho I believe we vote in favor of this it means the overview of it is it 's not going to affect us as far as reducing our rights go is that what you 're trying to tell me that you 're gonna ask the minister yeah my good the shortfall seem to be clearly put here well that guy said we 're just simply asking the minister to make good the shortfall of most certainly supportive yes it says right to the Minister for agriculture and premier seeking urgent assistant with rate support so we 're asking them to support it 's not going to put us in a position to put people off just clarify that the motion is clear and and that you know for if this motion was carried that you know we are clear on what we 're asking myself to write to I 'm through you madam chair yes I believe it is seeking support from the state if in fact has been suggested that council were to provide that rate relief we wouldn 't need to write to the minister we we have that capacity to for council to make a resolution to that effect the the purpose I understand of this is to to seek that essentially the the right support so essentially instead of us paying for any room for any rate reduction or rate payment in lieu of that in fact the state would do that so if I believe that madam mayor if it is not clear to some councillors then we should potentially adjust it to ensure that it does actually is clear if I may madam a just clear clarification what we 're asking for he 's a one-off grant at five million dollars to cover the lost rate income from farmers one-off grant and that would and that would be then followed quickly by thirty nine other rural councils asking the same question if we were successful but to see the whole rate tax it 's just a tax on a guest anyway I 'd like to see it replaced by direct payments of PSD revenues to the Shires to make up the shortfall I know that 's a long call but that 's what I 'd like to see but for this particular issue I will support your motion thank you thanks counselor tyno thanks madam mayor I 'd like to thank all councillors for their contribution in this debate certainly this motion we 've been workshopping this is a potential solution so it 's not quite right that we weren 't prepared for this so I actually circulated this motion around to the accounts allure group I 'd like to reiterate what the madam mayor has said this isn 't a lobby group this is our community this is our farming community it 's asking for it if you look across at New South Wales they and I don blown up the whole subsidy support for fodder trainer and Freight support you know a farmers would love to get that Freight support to to feed their livestock in that but that 's off the table that 's totally off the table because all that stone is driven up those costs around fodder the comments around cutting back services well we 're not actually cutting our rates we 're asking the state governments who provide that rate money in relation to councillor Buckley talking about rating strategies I don 't agree but this is not that debate that debate can be held when we have our rating strategy discussions again thank Council Reeves for his input and yeah we 're hearing from our community that this is the most equitable way to get money back into their coffers so they can buy fought us so they can 't spend money locally and certainly the advocacy party is important and I take that note on board I 'll just leave it at that thanks madam me thanks counselor Tino I have motion before you so all those in favor all those other business counselor pouts two more item I have two things short of me I think all counselors have received the the ones the other additional ones I guess the one that I would like to move first is the one in regards to support of the timber industry I request that the mayor write to the Victorian state government minister for resources the Honorable Jacqueline Sims MLC seeking an urgent assurance of certainty of the hardwood timber supply provided through the regional forestry agreements or equivalent to maintain sawmill supply volumes and ensure employment security of hardwood timber workers and their families in the East Gippsland region now I briefly spoke with regards to this earlier in my report in my council report and I just wanted to talk to it further but now my computer 's decide to have a little snoozy so I 'll just bring it back up I hereby give notice to move as a formal resolution of the East Gippsland Shire Council that the mayor right to the minister and second urgent assurance that certainly certainty of the hardwood timber supplies provided through the formal commitments to supply sawmills supply volumes of the East Gippsland region the timber industry is a sustainable and critical component on the East Gippsland community with I said 85% and they said seventy-five so I go 80% of the region being vegetated with natural hardwood forests the economic value of the harvesting process councillor pups can we just see if this will be accepted into it sorry so do we have it that 's okay I 'm a seconder thanks counselor raves okay I 'll put it to the vote all those in favor okay it 's now on the table please carry on councillor pelts bluh blah bluh blah to the table with what I 've said the timber industry is a sustainable and critical component of the East Gippsland community with 80% of the region being vegetated with natural hardwood forests the economic value of the harvesting process in the region is greatly respected and valued this resource is in line with the protection of greatly valued jobs in our region and the ACE Gippsland chose timber encouragement policy adopted four years ago the basis of this Emerald link tract which is a Labour Party pre-election promise announced late last year before the elections they proposed to make a walking track 120 kilometer walking track called the sea to summit trail which is scheduled for our region from the air and under plateau to cape conran and whilst we encourage economic tourism development in our region we believe it should be integrated and respectful of the hardwood timber industry workplace so instead of getting rid of the the coops that are actually coming up and just putting them all into national forests we believe the industry should be able to work hand-in-hand with in by eco-tourism propositions we encourage the current state government to come up with a plan where there are no net losses to the timber industry jobs nor listing areas in volume and productivity any jobs lost in the timber industry is definitely unacceptable to the east gippsland shire we 've had enough that 's my proposition Thank You councillor Reeves did you wish to speak councillor elders raised a great issue here and it 's something that many of us have been grappling operators and enterprises around the certainties of supply it 's very frustrating it 's very hard for those businesses to make long-term plans and invest in the important expensive plant and machinery and and staff training and operator skills so we need that certainty of supply as well regard to the summit to see Emerald link I think there was how many millions several million dollars was allocated as a state government election promised to do some investigation work and I I hope that we can see that 's come to reality and work harmoniously with the timber industry because that you know hopefully runs through some of the National Park areas and there 's no doubt that that 's an emerging and great possible industry for us and I 've had a number of people contact me about the great potential of that to link up with one day the great wilderness Coast walk and and so on that we all know could be one day our milford sound track of the southeast of Australia council Reeves speakers against along speaking up again would like to us councillor pelts you why I ask this where columns had a milk it was closed down before the wall because they cut out their patch on Matt Elizabeth well let 's the face always patch because we 've run a mill for quite some years it 's a you know old mountain ash Noel point ash it 's just purely mountain ash and it 's about what 80 90 years when it gets to the perfect stage and yeah and we kept a close eye on that during the times of my job flowing the sky grinder and we were sort of hoping that the bushfires wouldn 't swallow it up and they got quite close to it on a couple of occasions and and that Bush survived that well that stand survived because if we get a wildfire through a stand of a Alpine or mountain ash it can kill the whole lot you know it 's not like this lower score er stuff where it 'll copy us and survive and my question to you is that I 've noticed on some of these charts and I hope it hasn marked as a reserve well what does the reserve means that reserved until a butcher gets to it all is it reserved for in perpetuity or or or what 's the story because you know I think it 's an important close to an airbed style it 's close to a relatively close to where the couple of mills are big mills and you know III think those sort of places are really worth a visit but and I will do it privately and but can you tell me that what does the Reserve mean when they say that councillor Buckley oh I know you 're directing your questions at me and you 're talking about a section that I 'm unfamiliar with and I won 't presume to know and I 'll take that on notice but the bottom line is often the timber industry will reserve forest for ecological reasons or you know later you know preservation or to a certain time but all I know is the Erin Andrews an area that the galangal community and the environmentalists have been after to try and lock up for which are the victorian vic forests has had compliance to be able to harvest and a lot of timber workers have just late last year being issued five-year contracts five-year jobs security to harvest this timber and now it 's coming to the stage where it 's actually being offered to them they were about to start on it and the environmentalists have actually now put the it back on the table to stay away from because they 're talking about locking it up and making their an under track and we feel that it 's unfair anything that they 've actually put in as a reserve there 's a stipulation in the forestry agreements that if it 's put into reserve there needs to be a alternative reservations unreserved taken out of reserve for the timber industry to be able to harvest so while whilst one is taken away the other one should be given back and they never give them back they 're only ever taken away so they 're actually diminishing the timber harvesting area which is actually 0.3 of one percent of the total timber that miniscule compared with the timber and the ecology of the region that we have out there and they 're wanting the whole lot basically so we need to look at this as a do we secure economic viable jobs in the region versus a walking track that 's locked up for forever basically in regards to you know invite um you know people wanting to come out to the bush and just walk around it and and have no asset value back into our community or a smaller asset value than what actually is there now is what I 'm talking about thank you are there any further speakers no I 'll put the motion to the vote all those in favor motion carried unanimously and council Pelt 's your last item oh yes now this is very relevant to the mallacoota community we 've come up yes yes okay thank you I can 't gallery the motion that I 've proposed is that the mayor deliver personally deliver a letter to the environmental the Minister for environment and energy environment and climate change the Honorable Lillian D 'Ambrosio MP Esther II opening that are currently triggering when the water level reaches 1.5 meters so that 's what we 're putting on the table okay the person is clarifying that this is for mallacoota estuary opening not it so that that so this that should refer to mallacoota yes three opening okay sorry councillor Reeves you 've seconded the item to be admitted I 'll remember miss Nelson can you please clarify whether we do need to specifically ask for mallacoota are we looking at the policy more broadly I think my recommendation would be that we seek a review of the the guidelines more broadly because this is not an issue just that happens at mallacoota like Thais Beach is another example that where the when the Arabs are yeah been River where the when the ester is closed you know has impacts all the way back up to now an hour and I think it would be yeah yeah that if we 're gonna review it then we should review all of them in which case then it probably shouldn 't review of reference a water level because the trigger points yeah okay thanks for that clarification councillor Reeves counselor to e did you hover mr. Nelson would that in your opinion would that slow down the the reason for going about this which is to get this opened here that 's that 's the thing that concerns me if we if we do it more broadly that I know in previous instances asking government departments the general idea is about two years to get anything done and we certainly don 't want it to take that long so my question is will that effect if we ask the broader question or we should we be specific in this instance and then perhaps add a second question in regards to revising all of the of the trigger points as a secondary question he 's a really good point given the pressures here absolutely so maybe sorry I didn 't have a chance to beforehand but maybe maybe it is a to type huh yeah because the priority right now the immediate priority is mallacoota so absolutely I understand that but so maybe maybe the clause does stay as there 's a second part which is to more generally have a look at a more broad a review of the guidelines for the other areas on the same basis it just happens to be a pressure point here ok so we need to vote on to bring it into yet another so I 'll put that to the vote all those in favor ok so motion is carried 8 1 well you both had your hand up Ben and John Dean yeah ok so do we have any further speakers to the motion I speak yes please speak to the rationale I hereby move on behalf of my fellow councillors in response to the viability of the mallacoota community that the mayor personally deliver a letter to the Minister of Environment hence giving opportunity to better discussion the Honorable Lilly damn bro Co MP in regards to reviewing the CMA guidelines for s3 opening that are currently triggered when the water level reaches at reaches 1.5 metres the rationale behind it is currently there is a big inundation issue of the foreshore of mallacoota Inlet which is currently at the entrance has been closed for three months now as we heard due to little rain in the catchment and no natural flushing out of the natural lake system as a result the water has raised above the port and the boat jetty so they cannot be you and are being severely damaged and weakened to remember ism is being compromised because of the jetties being underwater and people are staying away from the mallacoota region because of this issue the water is up and over the road and is no doubt causing severe damage and washout to our infrastructure we believe this the EMA guidelines are not respectful to community assets and infrastructure and that our part that your policy is aiding excessive expense to taxpayers and ratepayers in the regards to repairs when the water finally subsides to boat hire businesses in the township have had to close for many days on in as they are unable to launch their vessels safely leading to loss of income and economic hardship less fisherman venturing out as the water is stagnant due to loss of oxygen in the water and according to the locals in the history of the inlet from what I gathered last night it has never opened under the history has never opened under natural causes and has been assisted five times for most beneficial outcome to the community we request that the minister individually reviewed the practicality of the current guidelines and take our concerns into consideration and immediately moved to manually open the inlet to allow fresh water circulation ecological stimulus and better health for the mallacoota Inlet aiding in the economic stimulus to the region thank you Thank You councillor pouts further speakers thanks for bringing that to everybody 's attention councillor pelt it 's a really valuable thing and I 've lived here when the water has been backed up and it 's really inconvenient and I think miss Nelson your tender over here to the motion is quite valuable so that 's what 's been added there so specifically to mallacoota the trigger being at 1.5 meters but the other estuaries being looking at the Keira destory opening guidelines I was thinking of triggers but guidelines because it 's quite complex around complexities of nature that conspire at the moment so yeah thinks that 's that 's great I 'm happy with that thank you speakers against the one and only I guess but the reality is this the the the management of Esther is an Esther own waters has been well managed by the state of Victoria for for um probably more than a hundred years in many ways in the present time we 've received briefings at Council based on reports from the experts in the management of of this knee-jerk reactions to the release of waters doesn 't proactively improve the the aquatic environment it doesn 't move the sands awake as rapidly as you 'd like and often it 's not human interfere and educated in human interference with the breaking home of history 's causes more ecological damage than it that it Bennett prevents this this is not an area of expertise for local government it 's not something we we know about the the work is being handled right now as we speak by Parks Victoria a government authority in conjunction with experts both academic and II as well as the ones that timber all the way through to now now and further west for us to start coming trying to manage their work is like us going to another scientific government body and telling them or then coming from another body and coming to local government telling us how to do our business it 's it 's Anna recognized and discussed issue in this in this area here at the moment but there seems to be a lot of cool heads about the matter as well as a few other words you know with a bit of color in them to to be suggesting to our partner groups in the area that they 're not competently addressing the issue is I think a bit mischievous and I really just can 't support it I can understand some of the frustrations with the water coming up but the reality is it 's a natural occurrence and we could perhaps do more by encouraging people because this is a public statement a conversation we 're having so this will be discussed other way in other places and and opening the entrance themselves to the detriment of the history so please really think about what this mattering in another aspect thank you thank you councillor to e I 'd like to speak for the motion as counselor Ellis pointed out it 's not our role to manage waterways and but it it is however a role to advocate on behalf of their community to situations that our community believes that they face we 're not actually asking them or telling them what we want them to do what we 're asking them to do is to review the height and to potentially do something in regards to allowing the the opening and I I do see that as our role and that 's why I 'm more than happy to to vote for this I haven 't the right to to repeal just should just a little councilís know that some years ago in the recent years there was a review office during openings so just so you know that happen so it 's not we won 't be getting something new thank you speakers against speakers for to his comments but also where it impacts us and where we do need to take a lead and support our community is its impacting our assets nothing more nothing less thank you any further speakers counts counselor okay sure counselor what actually counselor Ellis just said that they had been a review recently but I was actually going to point out that in terms of reviews on how water has shifted around this country there 's one recently came to mind which is all the fish that died up in the darling river system and there was no need for that to happen but legislation told those people to release X amount of water for South Australia I think their likes called them an indie likes or something its legislation said they had to release it yet they caused to all those fish to die and the person who was interviewed who was a water person said that actually that had not been reviewed for seventy years that was just what they did so but of course counsel Alice has said that we 've had a recent review so not have been done for some time Thank You councillor pouts write a reply yes I 'd just like to say I 'm in regards to the review if it has happened I 'm not sure where the council was consulted with regards to the impact of the new regulations but we all know that inundation is at that point eighth of a meter which is a fair a fair method of thumb which is widely spoken about in the planning industry and for 1.5 meters whilst there 's a tidal aspect I 'd like to say we 're finding at point nine which the inlet actually is now we 're seeing severe asset degradation and damage to community assets which are costly to replace we heard from one of the local community members today that the jetties underwater and it has been for several months they 're wanting us to revoke jetty licences so that 's an economic impact to Council and also under all the as the jetties are under water they 're also deteriorating which he declared and guess we 'll get our our our maintenance people but the bottom line is it is a very real cost to our community and to our council as a whole so respectfully I would urge you to support this recommendation because I think it is actually the right thing to do in regards to the mallacoota community and in regards to council escapes moonshower councillor assets so with that stated that 's my proposition Thank You councillor Phelps I 'll put the motion to you all those in favor all those against motion carried 8 1 thank you okay we will now move into confidential business can I have a councillor a matter madam mayor in accordance with section 77 2 C of the Local Government Act 1989 that it 's not the usual just while we find the wording we 're just moving into confidential business to discuss contractual matter and so we 'll do this in camera and then we 'll come back out and make the decision in public so I think you 'll be asked to just vacate the room while we discuss that after we 've read the motion is that the right word 's the wrong can we just have counsel a move that we move into a closed session that 's the Roberts same you know counselor tyno all those in favor we 're supposed to read it mr. Buckley are you voting too maybe into camera counselor Buckley counsel the Buckley we 've just voted to maybe into camera sorry yes thank you that 's okay motion is carried thank you _"

CEO before I can I 'd like to acknowledge the presence of counselor Ben Buckley from the omiyo region a member of our Council currently on suspension and returning to Council on the 23rd of November welcome counselor Buckley as is my habit I normally talk from my feet and without referring to notes but in the consequence of this particular election and the tactics that have been used I hope I gain Council 's indulgence by referring to my notes rather than speaking so yeah talking about tactics I 'm not sure what he actually means by that Thank You counselor tyno but can we young counselor also I 'll let you two talk thank you I 'm sorry I 'm not going to turning into debate this this session this evening is simply about kandacy for the position of me I 'm not interested in entering to debate with councilor ratinho I 'm going to commence the read the situation by it 's simply a simple preamble council a large rural shy with assets nearing a billion dollars in value an annual budget of around a hundred million dollars per annum which is in Juneau into the strong financial management practices introduced to Council a well over a decade ago practice with which with ongoing self improvement place Council in a strong position with negligible debt and open reporting practices this position allows council to make decisions and provide services to a local government level to the benefit of ratepayers and visitors it has further enabled canceled the face of state in positions such as rate capping and the right out of the federal government 's freeze on grants to local government we are also declared the most secretive council in Victoria a derogatory image I 'm led to believe that it was published both online and throughout the press you know the wider Victorian press this is an image that certainly has spread with some mirth across our local government industry now as we all know the prime cause of this dig is the large number of capital works projects undertaken on an annual basis across are unfairly labeled for that reason that said the current time reality for us and and the wide wide held public view of our council is that we are indeed our most secretive council one that offers favors to one and not another and this is not that 's truly not representative to the people of East Gippsland and it is a hard view to dispel and the one principal reasons for that perception of a seeker he was a change in the direction in the style of decision-making and behaviour from the mayoral office behaviors that circumvented the proper processes of council and the creation of an informed counsellor group actions mirroring those of the pre Kennett amalgamation days I shall provide examples of these behaviours later in my speech this is an example of the direction in which we 've been taken and the public and our scene my my my principle message to you this evening and seeking your support inviting for me as your mayor for the year 2018 2019 is simple this is the year of transition from the past to the present from the of local government today and into the 2020s I believe that I possess and can offer the benefit of skills and experience I 've attained in local government to convince councils journey of transition back from the ill-founded practices of the past two years to the future challenging yet fulfilling expectations and experiences of local government over the next 12 months to form the basis for others others Smedley to drive councils future community to councils future community benefits the now door closed door of decision-making deals and promises will be open as we travel the road to improve levels of governance and achieving it as a leading local government right now effectively November 2018 the East Gippsland choy council has the opportunity to enter and the new and exciting time as an organization with tonight 's mayoral election promising change the imminent departure of an incompetent CEO and the arrival of a new CEO positive organizational cultural changes on the horizon councillors newly elected in the 2016 election hopefully will see many of their wants and desires realized and for others for had some little angst Weis changed needed the leadership of the council has slipped into the past behaviour of local government that led to the Kennedy intervention and the later creation of bodies such as the local governing spectrum who I all that is seen to be to the detriment of good practice in modern local government in our case and the alleged leads behind was probably human and led to a malice which was readily identified to remind councillors of some of the issues I will refer to a couple of the more prominent issues we faced during the past 12 months mr. mayor mr. CEO I 'm just going to call a point of order there 's a five-minute limit on the time to speak and at the moment it 's a commentary rather than a speech around audience can you please refrain this is a statutory meeting and please this is the chamber good things my point was that there is a five minute limit mr. CEO occasion it was never stated at the start that there was a five minute limit on each of the candidates speeches so I just like to clarify order here Institute 's only an interruption in the right democratic right to speak and and put forward an argument for a change in the leadership of this council so local law number one l 7.7 7 is refers to speaking times that 's correct five minutes mr. CEO the chair one further clarification it states that the mover of a motion has five minutes this is not a motion if I it 's a speech look I 'd ask counselor Ellis to if he can bring this to a conclusion soon well that will take away my right to argue for my for the CEO okay let 's get to the behaviors that would be causing concern I think the first I 'll remind Council is obviously blindfolding of open and transparent reporting to the council the group in particular or remind councilors of the Eagle Point dog bite issue where the identity of oak elbow resources executive and his wife was hidden from Council and the lawful action of staff was questioned and altered you may all remember that the suggested an alleged provision of inside information to flood of neural support leaders reminded one of the council Buckley allegations the unauthorized release of council information and however equally concerning in that aspect was the identity of the correspond all of whom did not openly declare their identities and relationships with counsel I referred to the letter and I have copies here signed by a Rob Bishop 54 Ford 's Creek Road den style mr. Bishop is actually the chairman of Kelbo Resources Chris Cook Eagle Point as previously mentioned manager of Kelbo Resources Jon Donson Melbourne donor of unsolicited mobile stage assistance with some tax issues xaviar Ryan blade brulee builders possible tenders for shire projects John Glen hoax reached our planning matter and bat cluster the distributor of the of these formatted council formatted letters and I will drop miss the next one on the blocking and delaying of councilors request for action which as counsel doing knows has been a major concern the provisional of special treatment for preferred projects a number of actions have been deployed with our proper knowledge of support to of the blows make now on two of the most blatant a mountain bike track loop both of these projects are worthy of in principle support and now I held that position however neither project health councils full support when taken to the GL gen the Gippsland local government network for support the use in practice been inappropriate influence on the independence of the local media and we 're gonna get a right to respond to this excuse me just Joe you come you have a right as a guest room yes yeah oh can we please can I finish mr. CEO yes you can please thank you okay there 's a whole series of concerns that I would like to bring to remind councillors up use you to fake news and we know one can forget the non-event opening of the lakes entrance put which was not a council with me there is a whole series of other issues that I would like to have brought to you remind you of councillors on this all can be changed by your supporting me in the next 12 months it 's all the period I need so what can you expect from number of things one the mayor 's door will always be open there will be no hidden agendas support for the incoming CEO on behalf of the council voicing its issues and support for the CEO as he addresses organizational change and improvement confident advocacy and representation I 'm just going to jump over a few these a desire to tackle some of the more difficult issues both morally based and practically based that face local government and particularly where we LOCOG McCann had some impact to the benefit of our community be prepared to attack the cuff ' tough questions of the Raymond Island Ferry bursting endpoint ocean access boat ramp the mineral sands mining issue the bat colony matters in summary any of the issues where we have direct ownership or a responsible community expectation or responsibility to do so I also will provide support and encouragement all cancers looking to improve their local government skills participation in and knowledge of the sector which results in the benefit of our community improve briefing sessions and use of council encierro discusses and I have a whole series other things manner now I prepared this speech under belief that councillor ratinho was standing for me and that was publicized I have some words to unit Lee there 's the proud father of two bride capable and successful young women one of a whom like you has two young children I am acutely aware of the challenges they face in enhancing their career ambitions I 'm pleased to be in your company and likewise recognized you as someone who exploit future before in fact if ruinous of any truth it has been said to me that you 're being prepared and in line to take the place of one of our national party of representatives in my role as a councillor and former mayor and of more recent times a board chair several diverse entities I 've been involved in the unveiling of gender barriers at state level as they applied to my roles and working through this process which on occasion soft I 've challenged to my understanding of things I 've been introduced to a number of expressions which were not in my normal vocabulary words such as glass boy the last two expressions are I struggled with initially but what did the expressions really mean well they simply racist or ageist in slang comments dove envy or simply just anti Murdock I still do not know clearly what what they mean that last Tuesday I think I gained a better understanding by observing the actions and words of counselors ratinho and Reeves an established pair of snallygaster in the nomination of you as candidate for the role of me the underlining urge for the retention of mr. CEO I think this has finished I have just been called something I don 't know the meaning of I think it 's insulting I don 't understand how this contributes in any way to make good governance Thank You counsel really I don 't know how it contributes to good governance I 'll ask you to finish okay what I 'm saying to at least that I generally wish you well and now did you have the ability and time when time allows for you to be an excellent public representative of our communities at either state or if you my words were to indicate support for you and your future not to enter into this competition as idents mentioned earlier the original debate was to be with councilor routine not with you they offer a strong a strong a strong support for the future and I 'm happy to provide evidence of the concerns I 've had over the past 12 months in particular we need strong independent leadership for this council to recognize the issues that face people in our community via the sand mining issue or other issues I 'm suggesting that the continuance councillor able to support the council O 'Connor no matter how fine a person she 's will continue under the influence of council with the undue influence of others and I therefore request you to support me strongly in this manner thank you thank you ladies and gentleman thank you we have two nominations for mayor the first nomination was for councillor O 'Connell going votes for councillor O 'Connell place go in favor 1 2 3 4 I count four votes the second nomination was for counselor Ellis can I have votes I will now read what occurs when we have a four-four vote if there are two or more nominations to receive the following procedure will take place we will place the names of each of councillor O 'Connor and counselor Ellis into some clear balls I 'll actually have to turn my my face while that 's being done because I will be the one that will do that no jokes so because we haven 't got a simple majority will we drawing the mirror out of the container so ladies if you will prepare councillor O 'Connell is an elected mayor I think I know just got to find out where I am now okay no but first of all I 'll ask counsel or O 'Connell to come forward so we can congratulate mr. ass so yeah I 'd like to make some comments just as the f yeah [Applause] I 'll now ask counsel as if they 'd like to do some introductory comments on their comments and congratulate the Lumia but first I 'd like to on behalf the staff congratulations counsel O 'Connor the youngest think okay counselor counselor return over the outgoing Mayor please good evening to everyone and respect always tonight is history in the making for East Gippsland Shire Council our first ever mayor from the Omo region and I urge all my colleagues to support 100% this strong capable mayor that will bring energy and a young vibrant family perspective to this role respect always I want to take this opportunity to thank all the staffer to help me and our current council achieve and deliver the significant projects for the past two years I 'd like to especially acknowledge and thank brigaded you who does a fantastic job for all the council 's and myself and Colleen Smith I also want to take this opportunity to thank former Director of Operations mr.

to my colleagues and emphasized that the culture begins with us the council our group respect always under my leadership and being our council leader amongst equals we have achieved some significant things together promoting a strong and healthy business community open for business and creating significant public value you cannot have strong public value without a strong and thriving business community people need to work we 've had a record in East Gippsland the business Awards last week which was attended by councilor white as well key priorities we have identified and been focusing on in the past two years we 're providing long term strategic vision for the East Gippsland community prioritizing health and well-being of our community working on organizational culture streamlining planning processes that support our community needs a focus on stronger community engagement including a regular social media presence and there 's a toll to continue engage with our our community 's regular Shire news updates live streaming of council meetings and special occasions like citizenship ceremonies taking roadshows of council meetings outside the band style corporate center working with the vocational and tertiary education sector to create opportunities that can retain young people and provide training opportunities for our key sectors I agree food hospitality and professional services create capacity amongst our local vendors and contractors that they can take advantage in tendering for council contracts thus helping the positive knock-on effect of our local economy make it easier to live in East Gippsland through advocating for enabling infrastructure and connectivity advocate for small businesses the engine room of our regional economy create opportunities for business to work with young people creators not job takers become an age-friendly region make tourism a key priority for the region last year we had one point for me and visitors to East Gippsland can someone in the audience tell me what the most visited icon in East Gippsland is who said back in caves you 're right very good how do we maximize that opportunity we are seeing destination restaurants establishing in any skips land sardine at Painesville easy skips lanes first good food and wine chef 's hat the first one to receive such an award in 30 years the last one was marshal waters from rivers Lee for those who are old enough we also now have the long paddock at Lindley the northern ground it bends though all these facilities showcase our beautiful regional produce and make the connection from paddock to plate we 've been successful in securing funding through federal government building better regions and the state government RDV to build a world-class mountain bike destination omiai and it 's forecast to attract an additional 60 thousand tourists to East Gippsland these grant opportunities only materialized through respectful targeted meter based on a hugely successful Mornington Peninsula hot springs the potential hot springs by the way attracts four hundred forty thousand visitors per year and an Ernst Young economic modeling projection shows that the meeting proposal will be attracting somewhere around eighty five thousand visitors per year to East Gippsland and predominantly in winter and that 's been our problem in East Gibson we have lots of tourists in summer and not many in winter we 've dealt with some legacy issues and that have played several of our councils in the past but together we have managed to move them along things like the mayor and bar Heights subdivision in the northern growth corridor Lakes Entrance the restrictive covenants at Eagle Point which were impacting on our community the bam river boat ramp the Giles Street bridge the legacy landfill rehabilitation at Bosworth Road the ongoing planning and maintenance future costs for Rome and Island Ferry the slip road marine precinct to name a few however along with legacy issues you occasionally get a few legs legacy positives are not congratulate the former councillors who were instrumental in aquatic recreation center we often hear a lot about rates and regularly moving to our beautiful region or other regional areas of stating that our rates are too expensive let 's briefly analyze this concept on 800,000 residential property 967 962 dollars per annum if you live in the city of Stonington which has a rate revenue of 98 million dollars but only covers a landmass of 26 square kilometers the same 800,000 residential property at Mornington Peninsula is sixteen hundred eighty four dollars per annum in rates but they have a rate revenue of 150 million dollars and a land mass of seven hundred twenty three square kilometers let 's have a look at a small rural area like Volokh Shire Council on eight hundred thousand property the rates are six thousand nine hundred and ninety dollars but let 's have a look at their rate revenue twelve million dollars and they 're looking after eight thousand square kilometers this little race example example shows how the cost of living is becoming unbearable for many regional communities we live in a life we in local government are being asked ahead is only through working together in all forms of productive collaboration focused on community first decision making that we can work through this and many other challenges we must continue the relentless advocacy that we have implemented in last two years to ensure that our concerns are hurting both Spring Street and Canberra we must fight hard for our fair share and nothing more nothing less thank you for listening I wish you all good health and good night respect always thank you sir I have any further castles like to speak gun Thank

CEO do you have any public questions mr. mayor we 've received four public questions the first public question is from Heather Terrell the question is that are represented from the Historical Society the old damaged water troughs in Martin 's Road on council power Blaine is it the property of the show that 's the first question and the second question if it is would you consider and agree to donate it to the Historical Society I 'll ask mr. weights to respond to that thank you now councillors I 'm not really aware of whether that is I would assume if it 's on council property it will be the Historical Society if there 's a better use for a bit of infrastructure that 's just declining in the paddock thank you council pearls just recently am I was chatting with some of the locals and there seems to be a wave on the old-fashioned water troughs they 're coming back into vogue to do up and have us display pieces if it was a council piece it would be great if the Historical Society could have it thanks council pills Thank You mr. CEO mr. Muir the second question is from Audrey Vandenberg and she 'd like to come forward now so question is Nelson could you please whichever it 's with concern I asked counsel to strongly Lobby federal and state Parliament 's to a retic rate you Radek eight feral animals that are destroying the environment of East Gippsland I asked the council to coordinate with all chose east and northeast of Melbourne to deal with this problem as a united group please be proactive and act now thank you I 'll ask mr. Holton to respond thank you very much for that question whilst council lies largely with domestic animals and livestock we do on the occasion when residents trapped feral cats we ensure that those feral cats are dealt with humanely by a veterinarian the author or the authority that deals mainly with feral animals in the in the landscape is the Department of Environment land water and planning they are the primary prosecutors of any action that would be taken in respect of feral animals however I would be more than happy to voice your concerns to my colleagues in that department the Department of Environment land water and planning at the next opportunity when it arises and and also speak to colleagues in neighboring councils about an approach to working with the state government on dealing with those issues Thank You Council polls had a question yes I have I think just recently the planet ark process was just undertaken not so long ago with regards to eradication of foxes but I think maybe Audrey is more concerned with the deer and those animals that are around their Highway at the moment we seem to be having a huge amount of them concern is about those and wild dogs thanks again fails counselor she had a question Morris typing mr. Muir just in relation to the response have a state government level I am aware that guilt has been undertaking a large amount of work and research into the problems of feral animals not only in Gippsland but in the Northeast in particular the there are a series of policies that the state government just recently introduced in relation to the management of feral animals and I see that the catchment management authorities in the northeast of the state of also undertaken Studies and prevent an uncertain corrective actions against these animals it probably as mr. Hoffman referred to would be handy for council to speak with their colleagues set up to prosecute the concern of the community and relations of the impact of feral animals particularly deer horses and dogs as that 's very major concerns at this time and finally oh and the custard cats and pigs as well of course but to keep it under that one term and and to highlight the problem we we are also aware that kinda managing the feral animals in the near future Thank You councillor Ellis mr. mayor question number is also from Audrey Vanderburgh would council please advise all ratepayers of residents of the protocol of approaching council at public question times it 's not enough to advertise the council meeting in the local papers as some residents either don 't buy these papers or don 't read the council news could council address this lack of correct information by enclosing the protocol of addressing council meeting in with the rates notice could council address this lack of full and accurate information by educating front-of-house staff as head office and agencies thank you it 's better to respond thank you Miss Bennet thank you thank you for the question I 'm sure like councillors firstly I 'm disappointed to hear that people have tried to lodge a public question time and that hasn 't been possible so on behalf of the organization my apologies for that the question has many parts so forgive me if I miss one but if we start can could council address this like a full of absolutely can we felt that we had but clearly perhaps the last set of changes that were introduced haven 't been properly communicated so we will take it on notice to do that we will also attempt to get written information out more proactively to the likes of our outreach centers and our business centers perhaps displayed on local notice boards in local newsletters and any other forum that we can think of all may be suggested in terms of the suggestion that we pop a copy of that document in the right notice I 'm certainly happy to take that on notice but I can 't give a commitment at this stage because there 's a lot of pressure on what goes into that envelope you can imagine most of the units of the organization think that 's a great way just disseminating nation and it is but I just need to put this request in with those and if there 's room then I think it 's an excellent suggestion and very happy to comply the fourth question is from mr. Ben pie mr. Park with regards to profits will be during will flow directly out of the region to Melbourne how does our council support and think that this is good for their residents the businesses and the region thank you just a little bit of context for the alternative energy project involved by scheme that councils running in over the last twelve months roughly we undertook an exercise in understanding how we can shift energy use in ask its land to more take-up of more alternative energy and what the opportunities were to do that and in the consultation that we did 85 percent of people who engaged in that process identified that they are concerned about the cost of electricity and that key barriers to reducing energy costs were cost of solar systems in East Gippsland the motivation and lack of good information to actually support good decision making so what we did was engaged experts to help us understand what action council could take to help community members take up solar energy in a more proactive way and there was significant support through that process for council to facilitate a solar bulk by scheme up more solar generation thus reduce and a solid bulk by program is one of the ways that we can actually increase people 's access to solar systems by reducing that upfront cost and information barriers the system that we 've chosen engages local installers and with the approach that we 've taken we also there is also a contribution to community projects being offered solar systems and one of the biggest one of the biggest impacts is actually a reduced volume of money that goes out of this community and I can 't remember the figures but it 's it 's quite large amount of money that will be retained here that previously went to large electricity supply companies which would no longer be the case so as a result of the recommendations of the bright energies or the bright future alternative energy project we were we did identify the delivery of a solar backfire scheme as one thing that council could facilitate and using the resources that we have had through the victorian government we 've acted to engage experts advice to help us resource and implement a on the most appropriate way to implement a scheme as a local government organization and looked at what the sector had been doing across Victoria and where other local governments have actually implemented these schemes and experience has been that managing both by schemes with multiple local providers results in a significant number of challenges and administrative burden associated with it which means it 's not as effective our selection of the the process is within our resources because we 've engaged a not-for-profit organisation to help us do this it provides people with sound independent advice to local residents and in the form of a quote which they can then market test with local providers and it 's been I guess specifically the people that we 've chosen and many bulk buy arrangements don 't use any local content in this case we are using local provides we understand that this I 'm asked about it but the you know the intent of increasing the opportunities for people to access cost-effective solar for a local product local installers to be engaged in the process for this first 12 months more competitive and increasing the the volume of people using solar but that 's our clear intent but I 'm very happy to have a you know a separate conversation with you I can 't have a conversation with you sorry had a follow-up question what what 's the question it 's disruptive to local solar businesses and it makes it harder for them to establish themselves how does our council support and think this is beneficial to the residents of our and our region yes so as mr. Nelson answered before it was we 're encouraging an uptake of solar with some right advice around t1 equipment and certainly I was at the installers meeting that you are at and local providers of that team on equipment have said that they could potentially in the future match that so certainly the next iteration of vaultboy they 'll certainly be considered yes castle Buckley I take it to mean in that case mr. man I take it to mean that we can involve the local suppliers in the bulk by part of it you know whether with materials or am succinctly that the local providers can 't supply this bulk buy stuff you know so relation to the question you asked that yes certainly the the providers of tier one equipment because we 've got to compare apples with apples that were at the installers meeting that I was at certainly indicated that they 'd be competitive with that equipment and we 've certainly invited them to the next iteration of solar bulk buy to be considered miss Nelson if I can just emphasize the fact that the the process provides people with a quote which they can compare with local providers through this current program so if people want to get a quote and get that independent advice about what their system should be and then compare it with local providers and they 're you know certainly welcome to do that and if the there 's an indication that local providers can be competitive then and people are happy to to buy local that 's absolutely fine as well that 's part of what this process is is trying to generate as many people using solar as possible Thank eight point one is assemblies of councilors June 2018 this recommendation moved council polls second council Rives any questions before we put that motion all those in favor against okay thank you I 'd in 1.9 have we received any petitions petitions with Samantha and item 2 notices of motion or rescission inflation or said mr. mayor item 3 any deferred business no business mr. Mann item 4 is counselor reports and counselor would you like to start us off please Thank You mr. mayor I have my reports very brief this month and I have lodged with the council offices thanks Thank You councillor 2e_:_1216.11 counselor a thanks mr. mayor I I will Lodge my report with the officers I just like to say I 'm happy to be here in August today it 's an exciting time to be able to get out of the Corporate Center and being from only I understand what it 's like to be outside of the main center so I 'm pleased that we were able to be in there in the small communities today I 've had a busy month but I suppose that I attended the official opening of the 2018 snow season and Mount Hotham with Mara Tanner and also Guatemala was doing the welcome to country also since had a meeting with the CEO of Mount Hotham and the CEO on councils of the Alpine Charter begin discussions about marketing the great alpine road with this there 's significant opportunities to collaborate with other shows and agencies to promote the great alpine road from East Gippsland it 's been a great start to the snow season with plenty of snow and good weather and just like to encourage businesses from East Gippsland from bands go right through Tony on the great alpine road that working with Mount Hotham to promote and encourage skiers and snowboarders to travel that way of ice cubes land is is an untapped market so I 'll leave it there thank you thanks counselor Carl councillor Reeves thanks mr. Muir and happy to be here excuse my back everybody in the gallery there I 've just been looking at the minutes of the meeting held here on the 11th of November 1994 and there hopefully we can do the same although we 're streaming its so the images are there anyway there 's two areas that I want to concentrate on one was about this time of year where a lot of the service clubs have their change overs and I 've attended many rotary and lines changeover celebrations and it was just I wanted to draw attention to the importance of volunteerism in our Shire and how those service clubs and volunteers whether they be CFA SES the coast guard down and Marlow today how important they are in gluing our communities together so that 's the first one the second is at the weekend I attended the deep winter fist festival here in in in all bust and what a fantastic night it wasn 't Friday night and by coincidence last night on backroads on the ABC there was an article on Scottsdale in Northeast Tasmania and I 'm sure that many of us who watch that show drew many parallels about a town that had a declining timber industry and reestablishing itself and I thought that there was a lot of of Chris and Gabby and establishing these niche businesses and what really struck me with that meeting or that show last night was that in future in country Victoria and towns like ours it 's unlikely there 'll be one BD employer providing hundreds of jobs there 's likely to be hundreds of enterprising people like the sailors graves like the bush where cafe out there at cabbage tree like what 's happening at home you know with potential mountain bike pars and so on those lots of many things are going to create the wealth in the future and it 's up to us as a shire to make sure we support them and I will also note for us here in all boss 'd that one of the jewels in the crown of our area is cape conran and there 's a change in the management of Banksia bluff and we need to ensure that Parks Victoria do it well because this is one of the reasons many people come to our area to go and camp there and so I think that we need to make sure the likes of Conran and our natural resources as well supported as those enterprises my reports there are for the record to councillors Thank You councillor Reeves council Roberts Thank You mr. mayor also not much to report this month however among our not usual duties I attended the imagine fusion fiber arts network incorporated show at the East Gippsland Art Gallery it was well attended yeah obviously a fantastic job as always Crystal Lisa and Sonia were doing a great job behind the scenes but last night the deputy mayor and I attended the council 's first planning mediation session this is a new new process allowing objectors and proponents to come together and have thoroughness back full discussion around planning matters the process was a real success and many the points of view were expressed speakers were passionate while still being respectful to one another with a possible compromise being identified and I 'd like to commend the attendees and also the deputy mayor for chairing this session thank you thanks Council Roberts thanks for the insight on that first mediation process council Buckley thank you mister me igloo style thing with better foot thick concrete walls on private property and I 'm getting a slopes and it intrigued me because it doesn 't seem to be listed anywhere or recognized anywhere in our military history and it turns out a very very stout building indeed blast-proof and it turns out it was a little powerhouse to run a radar station and situated on just one of the the peaks of it or will not beach but you know the slopes and I found it extremely interesting to think that it hadn 't been sort of recognized and I haven 't heard of anybody knowing about it so thank you for that mr. mayor and I 'll follow it up and see if I can find some more about it Thank You X very much councillor Buckley counselor Ellis now Thank You mr. mayor my the lengthy report so I would simply table that and just select one or two matters to mention that may be of interest disturbing matter one was as I previously reported the council was my attending the inaugural our opening of a Food to people in need in our community I found that to be a disturbing issue when we have so many problems in our region and I 'd like to particularly commend the proprietors of the pinocchio in restaurant in lakes entrance and mr. Louise Hammond Henderson and her assistants from the opportunity shopping Lakes Entrance that have provided monies and assistance to that particular project I just hope that there 's no longer a need for that into the future I 've also been I should flag I 've also been approached by the the group a group recently formed in Bend style to see that the East Gippsland Shire is an asylum seeker friendly region I will be addressing council on that matter at our next ordinary meeting and have received correspondence from mr. Pryor and several other members of the been style community I see it as a worthy consideration of council and as a say flag that I will be bringing that to our next meeting for consideration I 've attended a series of launches across the city shower over the past month and and to save many volunteers that councillor Rees alluded to earlier I will leave my report as such thank you it 's it is interesting counselor Ellis at East Gippsland sure volunteerism is way above the state each councillor why thank you mr. mayor um just briefly being the time of changeover dinners I did attend the Linda no Lions Club changeover dinner which I was very happy to do so and at that changeover they also addressed us about their field day activities and how well that had worked out but what was really pleasing because um you know these people are very passionate about the their region was to see them distribute checks to most of the local sporting clubs schools kindergartens etc for their participation because it galvanizes the community brings them all together at the field days where they all have specific functions parking catering information etc and it was just wonderful to see that you know these very small groups in our community were benefiting but are also contributing to that great event we used to play field days so I do commend the Lions Club on on I wish them the best for the rest you know in the future thank you thanks Council what councillor Pels yes thank you mr. mee I 'm a bit tired today I 'm just freshly back from a 38 hour drive with my son up to Queensland and back while he raised his Motocross up there and the things mother 's sacrifice for their sons for the acquisition of their sporting behaviour I 'm exhausted and tired but all I 'd like to say is um I had the privilege of representing I 'm our mayor at the been stolen district art society and your light show was a very active night with much enthusiasm for the evening and the official outcomes of the paintings item 133 was Trish Wagstaff who did absolutely amazing intricate pencil fine art drawing over rhinos and rhinoceros called prowl and it was so intricate and finely detailed it was extraordinary it was like a photo it was that detailed that was the first prize of the night and the second a special recommendation of I went to Maria bold with her watercolor which was there was also a young junior award which went to Talia cook for her colored pencil drawing of Molly my goat with regards to that traveling afar and looking around and seeing what we what other places has is always interesting and you look at the sort of outer lying areas of Queensland and they have not on similar issues to us with regards to ageing populations and downsizing in industries people moving to the more urbanized areas and they 've managed to get smaller businesses up and running their region has really you know really intrigued interesting artworks that you can buy and and you know you look at it and you sort of think wow this is something that we can aspire to in the future they got jewellers they 've got mini markets there 's a lot of coffee shops and homemade apple pies and and various things and you know I look at those sort of areas that are well-established now and I think you know our region can also turn into something not I 'm similar in the future thanks councillor pills I 've tabled of key things this month saw the launch of the new four rivers young professionals group I thought it was important that we show support for this young group the name of the four rivers says it all they 're trying to engage with young professionals and young people across our whole region initially the meetings are in a forming stage where they 're just attending social gatherings supporting and mentoring each other and encouraging each other 's endeavours in their various careers and vocations they 're currently sharing this information and they 're well entrenched in various community and supporting associations one of them young jack peterson is also the east groups they try young citizen of the Year who reinvigorated the show last year and has got some great ideas around the band style show I 've also encouraged them to participate in any community forums that we have throughout the Shire and make sure that local about what is important to young people in our region we also saw the official opening of the Lakes Entrance mint shed which I attended with councillor Buckley and counselor Ellis Ellis was it was a big crowd of people there yeah this particular project had a few bumps along the way the facility is a real credit to all that have been involved with it just particularly thank the Lakes Entrance Lions Club and Wendy Brady for their patience and determination to see the project through a project that commits roughly four years ago Ellison yeah as we know the the men sheds are much more than just tinkering around and fixing things and building things it 's a movement that has seen a powerful way of addressing health issues and well-being and particularly mental health for members of our community also attended the National Assembly up in Canberra with councillor Ellison I was quickly given a quick overview of that this year 's conference was themed Australia Australia 's future make it local all about local government it reflects not just the wide scope and importance of local government but its ability to influence and affect fundamental change and improvement for the whole community the 2018 theme also hints at the strong possibility of a federal election either being the case local government need to be ready and able to speak and advocate on behalf of our community and make sure that we get heard and get what we need to make our community stronger there was a city significant program of excellent provided but the one that really caught my eye was the one by Burnett salt mr. salt a former partner of KPMG has gained national prominence with his astute observations on demography housing affordability and the Ellucian of consumer cultures of particular interest was a table that presented a smorgasbord checklist for successful regions I 'm keen to present this list for consideration leading into the workshops for our next East Gippsland show economic and development strategic framework some of the key items that I 'm particularly interested in relate to government 's new buzzword connectivity or as I like to describe it it 's it 's enabling infrastructure that really makes distance irrelevant Burnett 's salt suggested for a successful region you need a strategy around an airport you need a university presence you need a local TV station you need a local radio station CSIRO good hospitals we have B HS in bands though we have all boss anomia district hospitals we have a national event you need to get a national event either a business event and we had one recently the national horticultural innovation days out linden a and certainly in the visitor space we 're working towards the 2018 national master cycling event to be held here in East Gippsland need to have good schooling affordable housing aged care facilities a sporting stadium master plan which we 're been working on one for bands are now looking at getting funding to do one for the whole East Gippsland Shire need to have a good Convention Center local entrepreneurs really important that we support our local entrepreneurs because they are a job creators not job takers need to have destination tourist attractions 1.2 million visitors visit East Gippsland annually and that there 's great opportunities through produce of provenance and certainly around our new omiyo mountain bike park and creating that destination vocational training we certainly need to get the TAFE sector back up to speed it 's been missing the last that you need to have a strong business awards recognize success and keep saying business awards were reinvigorated last year with the corporate sponsorship from Federation business school who have taken that on for the next three years they talked about a strong cafe cold and I think would say more coffee shop safe enough you need skips then then we have for a long time and that the key one it was around collaborations and partnerships around federal state local government and this was our major theme when we advocated to Minister John McVay recently around the Regional Growth Fund and that was federal government state government together with local government x equals collaboration and success and and progress so that was the assembly but in relation to major events we have secured the the 2018 Masters Road Cycling Championships an estimated 500 competitors with 2,000 people in our region over four days psyching Australia says that it will be hosted in the picturesque Gippsland Lakes region for the first time in the events history meetings one reach in Paynesville will be showcased along with a number of other cyclists and to qualify as a masters you only have to be 29 in cycling so you still get the best of the best so there 'll be a road race time trial and criterium Minister for sport John Aron is proud to say he 's helping bring the 2018 cycling Australia masters the first time into Gippsland sure what that means boys is helping us but that 's good so that happens in the middle of October 18th to a 21st of October and just to support the greater Alpine Road certainly John Hutchins RC up there is trying to get engagement around greater summer activity and promoting the great alpine road is a key to Ring Road so the weekend is strain on the 22nd of July 2017 Jeremy Thorpe is the chief economist for PwC and he was quoted as saying that this type of tourism is the model for regional communities to survive and thrive Thorpe says the formula is quite simple in a seven-year period from 2009 to 2016 consumer spending on experience based tourism to destination tourism locations was up 26% while other spending four percent so that highlights the importance of us getting behind and supporting that a recent Australian reported to cycle tourism generally found domestic cycle tourists on average spend more than general domestic tourists per day however the total spend over their whole trip was nearly five times higher I think that will do the rest of my reports Tony thank you item 5 is the officer 's report item 5.1.1 is the place came in at sea 125 implementation of infrastructure design manual thank

Muir we are presenting this report for two purposes this afternoon one is asking council to note the changes that have made made to the policy and the other is to draw the council 's attention some of the achievements of the drone program since it was implemented 11 months ago on the first topic I 'm pleased to say that the review of the policy didn 't turn up any major amendments it did however turn up some improvements in terms of readability and understandability some of which were brought forward by counsel 's Audit Committee so those changes have been incorporated in the documents I 'd also like to just take a couple of minutes to flag how successful the drone program has been 36 flights have been undertaken in the last 11 months by our three Casa qualified pilots and conservatively that is safe Council 13,000 dollars that 's really in money terms the savings in terms of keeping our people safe and being able to undertake tricky jobs drone has so both time administrative effort and as the suit has kept our people safe we 're also very pleased to say that the policy which was produced entirely in-house by our staff has resulted in a framework for us to operate the drone that has resulted in no complaints so in this day and age where we 're all a bit sensitive about things flying overhead and capturing what we 're doing no citizen has complained that they felt that their privacy was being invaded or that they didn 't understand the reason why council was operating a drone in their area so I would like to both commend the amended policy to councillors and ask that you formally note that update thank you very much he 's been oh I was wondering if you would mind just describing one of the key activities that its pilot programs undertaken for the benefit of our gallery as I said there have been a range of matters the drones being used by each of the directorates in a number of business units but I think and I didn 't mention our own for a fee parks and gardens has used it to capture photo mosaic to assist with monitoring the removal of vegetation and parks and gardens also use it for tree inspections and I 'm sure you could appreciate that is a tremendous help because of both working at height and the relative ease with which you can pop a drone over a tree operations has been by far the major loser of the drone but just a couple of other things there is monitoring the sand movement at mallacoota as a result of dredging and also landfill rear vegetation and council Pelt 's has asked me to just note that the the statutory planning unit has also used the drone and in its case it 's captured 40 job a particular amenity that was the subject of a planning application which was then taken down to Melbourne and shown to the parent who commended the initiative as a huge saving in time and energy and also in giving Vic had a much better understanding of where that particular property was and what the constraints might be and how councilors recommendations be moved by Councillor Roberts we have a seconder SEC cancellous speakers thanks mr. mayor it 's fantastic to see an innovative innovative program piloted or should I say operated by council the programers is reducing risks to council workers and increasing efficiency reducing costs to ratepayers it 's also flattering to see that it wasn 't mentioned that other councils have been requesting to see our policy documents so they may emulate our practices I 'm happy to see the officers are also reviewing all legal regulations to ensure we retain the privacy of our residents please consider the recommendation thanks Council Robert 's any further speakers counselor Ellis what 's the core of right there coming to Council Roberts in terms of the appropriate use of the drones I would appreciate that there would be some sickness ISM in the general public as to the appropriate use of the drones councils taken great effort to ensure that an appropriate policy is outlined or referred to by mr. Bennett was put has been put into place and that council is confident that we comply with all the seen to be not only an economic but practical use of modern technology thank you thanks counselor are there any further speakers no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against Kerry thank you so item 5.2.1 is the adoption of the general evaluation for 2018 and we have mr. Collins in attendance Thank You mr. mayor and councillors every two years Council and is required to undertake a revaluation of all the Rachael and non ratable properties within the shire the 2018 general revaluation has been completed and has been certified as true and correct by the valley regional Victoria so council is now position to consider adopting the new property evaluations as detailed in the report once these valuations have been adopted they 'll form the basis of the calculation for the rates and for the rates and also the Victorian Government fire services levy for the 2018 19 year also to note is that the people the property owners do have two months to object to those valuations and that 's two months from the date of notice of the issue of valuation mr. me columns any questions councillors counsel Buckley 2.8% well I thought they write capping was supposed to be 2.5 so that sort of overrides all Latin people are paying anyone it 's Collins would you like to answer that please yeah thank you mr. Muir the valuations are used for the distribution of the total amount of rates to be raised what it does do that 2.88 means that some properties may pay less than 2.5 5% increase others may pay more depending on the movement of the valuations but a revaluation doesn 't raise any additional rates it 's just used to proportionally distribute the total of the rates to be raised Thank You mr. Mann thank you Miss Collins any further questions counselor Ellis just to clarify I understand that the value general is going to take responsibility for the valuation of properties throughout the state of Victoria can you tell us when that 's coming into a account and what impact that will have on counsel please do mr. Collins yes thank you for that I 'm question counselor Ellis the this is the last revaluation valuation act has given the value general the authority for all the evaluations of council properties that comes into effect it 's in effect now and they 're in the process of awarding the contracts for contract where they were to undertake the works for councils so that will happen annually from here on in it won 't be every second year every year there will be a revaluation of properties but will be its management administered by it directly by the valley regional Victoria and Council will be required to use those valuations that are provided by the value in general thank you yes that applies across the state of Victoria yeah this is only a mechanical question that is at the present time Council employs a private sector evaluator to provide us with valuations will that sector or that industry continue or will the evaluations been conducted by the value of genuine department and these employees my understanding is that our our current valuation contract ended in April this year my understanding is that the value General has tendered for a number of contract valuers and that primarily contracts that they 're awarding a present so there may be some in-house staff from the Valley Regional assisting but mostly my understanding is it will be done by contract thank you Miss Collins any further questions council what Thank You mr. mayor mr. Collins just if now does that take the if somebody was not happy with their rate notes or the devaluation does that take that away from counsel and have to be redirected to the government or would council still handle a complaint our understanding of the process will be that Council will receive those objections on behalf of the valuer general and then they will get considered by the very general directly through the process with whoever the contractor may be appointed for East Gippsland Council or each council but all of the process will be managed by the bathing we general the only thing that council will be responsible for in its own right will be the supplementary evaluation process will there be a savings to council directly because we won 't be paying a third party to be doing that all we still be value of generals findings there potentially may be a small savings to council but until we 've been through a full process then I couldn 't absolutely say that that would be the case but certainly we 've been advised there will be no additional cost to council for undertaking the revaluation annually any further questions we do have the recommendation before us councils move counselor pills we have a seconder councillor Reeves speakers there 's no speakers I 'll put the motion excuse me question to me again this is a motion and type of motion do I get the opportunity to speak against it yes you can 't speak against it thank you mr. mee I think we should not revert back to improve our system while it is reverting back to where we had it is within our power to have one capital improved value valuation we had almost had it here I mer had it we only had to worry about one particular tax there wasn 't a commercial rate there wasn 't a a residential rate it was all classed as one and it 's cuts out the gray areas of where you get tradies working out of their back yard and they 're only paying a a residential rate when there really should be technically and even doctors and lawyers and such doing the same type of thing where they 're only paying a residential rate and others that are in a clinic or whatever it might be or factory paying a commercial rate which is considerably more and it would simplify the whole system and do away with those gray areas if we used our powers to go back to a simple single tax instead of the differential rate grading system we have now thank you mr. Muir Thank You counsel Buckley is there further speakers see no further speakers right of reply yes I was just about to say with regards to counsel of Buckley 's comments you know you know a perfect world councillor Buckley it would be advantageous to be doing that but at this stage we are addressing what 's on the table in front of us and these are what we need to consider at this stage so to be endorsed and next year 's rates will be a whole different ballgame so we 're at the end of this cycle and basically we 'll be moving on to the new Governor General 's valuations of general the value of generals recommendations and we 'll be proceeding from with those guidelines next year thank you thanks counselor pals on their put the motion all those in favor against carried so item five point three point one is adoption of complaints management policy and revised customer response policy Thank You mr. karti I 'm good afternoon mayor and councillors and members of the gallery thank you um the council recognized the need to develop a compliance management policy as a result of seven service centers that council does have an a call center the volumes of customer interactions on an annual basis resulting in almost two hundred thousand site visits at all our seven centers together and about 80,000 phone calls over the year across our contact center just meant that we needed to manage not only customer response but also our complaints and interactions with our customers better know the Local Government Act also the Victorian Ombudsman to make it easy and enable our customers to complain to us easily but also for us to respond in a timely manner and learn from our complaints management process as a result the draft new complaints management policy and the procedure that will guide council staff to ensure that we enable complaints but also respond in a timely manner and learn from those complaints and make sure that we review our processes procedures and any other changes that may be required as a result the document the the document of the policy focuses on the framework which breaks it down into how we enable complaints and how we make it accessible for our customers to complain to us and the second stage of the framework talks about responding to complaints and have an introduction of a tiered approach where the front line which is the staff members at our service centers and various different officers over the phone 's try and map deal and resolve with the matter at the earliest and at the first contact as possible and we it is passed to the right actioning officer for not just prompt but also accurate and in favor or making sure that the outcome has been arrived and communicated to the customer the the third bit is to make sure that any complaint that has had the outcome and has been dealt with that we look at opportunities of improvements we look at learnings from these complaints and ensure that not only has a customer been communicated to but as a result the department learns from it and we ensure we don 't try and do the same thing again thank you any questions please counsel there is a recommendation before you move counselor Reeves second it counselor Roberts speakers after having a look at this document I can see that swathi and the the team are very thorough at the the way they handle complaints and dealing with customers and it 's good to see such in-depth analysis and how our system works and I support this recommendation thanks counsel Roberts any further speakers counsel opposed I just want to say it 's great to be getting some figures and it 's really the base because for us to be dealing with and it 's nice to be seeing something solid because it 's probably a ten months now that we 've been into the system so we have the start and then we have a second lot so we 've got um a bit of information coming through which i think is really great and you know eighty thousand they do a good job those fields in the call center can pass that on from the council loose thank you any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carried unanimously thank you urgent and other business we had any so consoles we need to temporary clear the gallery and need a motion in relation to discussing some contractual matters so just four members of the NGO we were temporarily closing to the public but we do have an afternoon tea after we 're finished and you 're all welcome to join us councilors all move that council now close the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 82 Local Government Act 1989 to consider items 7.1 to 7.4 as these items relate to personnel matters industrial matters contractual matters and any other matter which Council considers may prejudiced Council or any other person that 's been moved by Councillor Reeves seconded by Councillor Ellis all those in favor against this carried unanimously thank you _"

Radford what thank you on behalf of Council for the excellent work from your team in putting this together I know the electronic version of the annual report was well-received last year and it will be well received again this year and I think the opening and closing shots important we are an organisation about people and I think it 's fitting that we saw that at the end council has any questions please Christian counsel post-its mr. Redford if you may just clarify the process from here when is the doctor tonight Thank You counsel so the statutory obligation for council is to provide a copy to the minister by the 30th of September as counselors would recall he saw the audited financials which you 've you 've passed at a special meeting of council so this falls outside the the financial statements and more the achievements of the organization so the document has been provided to the Minister for local government and it 's a requirement that it comes to Council as early as possible after the 30th of September for endorsement so next steps should council adopt the annual report is that the document will be available on our website and distributed tomorrow through our customer service Thank You Council fells any further questions councillors we do have a recommendation before you do have a mover so council what did you and Kent Roberts thank you hours have gone to this from many different mediums and media 's and it 's it 's great to have a cohesive document that 's easily accessible to get a good overview of of councils working no workings over the last 12 months and come in this document and Thank You councillor oh it 's cancer Ellis now further words happened to collaborate the words cancer the Roberts and congratulate the mr. Redford on these good work and the diversity of media used in the promotion on this particular plane thank you any further speakers councillor pills it 's not too hot a few things given the fact that we are a population people I think it 's really interesting to see that 46.4% of our community is an aged population the annual report covers 203 pages so if anyone out in the outer side world is interested it will be available online and and I recommend that you actually have a good read of it to see what 's installed for us I think you know our aspirations are really important and I believe that the the baseline that most livable enviable community is a really great base for us to start with with some improvements I 'd like to just highlight with regards to the planning section that we are now coming in at eighty one point eight two percent of planning permits and it 's an area that the staff have worked really hard on I think there 's opportunities in this report to commend staff on achievements where we haven 't been doing so well in the past and they 've actually been recognized now in this document so I think that 's probably a really good idea for the community to take on board also I 'd like to say that the revenue that we get 53 percent of it comes from our rates and the other 47 percent comes from grant funding so if the community can bear that in mind we fare quite well in the way of grant funding it 's coming into our community to upgrade our assets and I think that 's really something worth commending from our staff to be able to source those opportunities when available and and take advantage of and with that said I 'd like to commend the staff and all counselors to support this tonight Thank You councillor pals any further speakers if there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against it 's carried unanimously thank you being no further business or close the meeting is six seven nine thank you _"

CEO thank you item one point seven is public question time we 've got a no public question time there was a request from mallacoota regarding the dredge but the person couldn 't appear but I will ask mr. White 's if he wouldn 't answer that question please so I know that it 's just not unusual practice but the person from a lacuna couldn 't attend certainly thank you mr. White 's would you like Oh mr. Weiss has a question his councillors community ring and asked when the channel to the metal coat ocean access boat ramp would be dredged because it 's been building up significantly over recent weeks in particular unfortunately we 've had the dread yard of action with a quite a minor part we 've been trying to source that for the last four weeks and for various reasons that hasn 't turned up we expect that part of us to turn up today the tracking with the carrier show that it was to turn up today that will put the dredge operational with 24 hours and we should be back into dredging this week but we certainly acknowledge that the sand buildup has been quite significant and at low tides the facility not very usable at other tides boats are getting in and out okay but it 's not ideal the way it is so we will be back into dredging the minute we can have that back on the dredge Thank You mr. White 's counselor Ellis just a little bit of trouble switch mr. White 's there 's this buildup of sand place counsel at the community that used that facility does that place them at risk of either harm or financial damage and finds second part of the questions would it be prudent of Council to close the ramp until we 're able to effectively clear the ramp careless there 's signage at the site at the ramp itself that outlines the condition of the ramp makes it clear that there is sand buildup but as I stated earlier the ramp is quite usable at various Heights just not at low tide and there is an onus on boat operators to take heed of the warnings at the ramp and make their own assessment Council is no different to any other boat roundoff operator around the state of the country there is no guarantee of access in and out of a facility like that obviously we would like to see it accessible at all times but there will be times where it won 't be usable and that 's not uncommon for ocean access programs counselor Ellis yep okay okay so what what it is it 's councils comfortable and maintaining 24 access to closed at the moment the boat operators obviously need to be aware and I 've made it quite clear at low tides it 's not usable at the moment the water depth is very shallow and there is always at risk coming back in after a day 's fishing if you haven 't taken note of the tides that will be very difficult to get back in so there is a responsibility as I 've said on both owners to be aware of the tides as as most offshore offshore boating operators are and and to make that judgment themselves but obviously we would like it to be dredged would have loved to have been dredged already however we have been waiting on this part for the dredge council Pearl 's Yoda quest so just as a follow-up from my colleague councillor Ellis 's question and with what you 've stated mr. mr. White 's is there an onus on Council to be monitoring and putting time appropriate time usage on that ramp I know it I 'm you 're saying it 's up to the boat owner but does stating that the ramp will be closed at this time and not available for use between these hours due to the tides is that something we need to do the message there at the ramp is broader than that we obviously tides change every day and quite significantly we could do that is it required I think the broad message there that outlines the issues with sand build-up and needing to take account of the tides is a reasonable risk management strategy councilperson yeah sorry with regards to that I think it 's appropriate for us to actually flag to the community that it 's unavailable to be used during low tides I think assignee should probably be put up there in regards to that mr. Weiser 's I 'm certainly happy to have a look at the actual wording of the signage that 's there at the moment and and if there 's the ability to exclude certain hours of use we we can certainly put additional notification up there the notification we do use is as I understand consistent with what other similar facility operators would provide thank _''_496.56 point one is a assembly of counselors and we have a recommendation there move councillor Reeves second counselor polls all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously thank you item 1.9 mr. CEO any petitions no petitions mr. dan hire them two notices of motion or rescission we 've received none mr.

it the 11th of April I along with yourself went to the fundraising breakfast Gippsland rotary at Henry House which was quite enjoyable the 21st to the 4th I 've went went down with the pre-organized group down to Odyssey house which which was I 've got to say very eye-opening if nothing else it was very very eye-opening it it it 's very much other than what I thought it would be yeah it 's I 'm still trying to go through just yeah it 's it was very very interesting very interesting indeed Anzac Day I attended the dogs December 10 o 'clock service at buck and South those country country settings because the morning tea is always spectacular and then last Friday had the head out excuse me I cancelled Marina consultative committee meeting along with the counselor Ellis and following that I actually shot out to the field days which was reasonably quite by the time I got out there but lovely weather went out Saturday as well with my wife and it was terrific a really really good show and whole lot of area I thought very very well thank you Thank You councillor tui councillor I call during April some of the things that happened was the pollie pedal which road from Melbourne to Canberra they stopped in a omiyo for the night which was a great opportunity for some local community members to catch up with Tony Abbott and other MPs and they also dropped in to the CFA Men 's Shed I attended both the dawn service and 11 o 'clock service for the Anzac Day servicing home.you which was a terrific turnout probably around 100 people work both so well done to the AMIA era self-organizing that and a couple of of Romeo citizens have been working on in returning the Army ICWA hall with the concept of creating and developing a community centre and I 'm pleased to report that we have heard back from the local CWA branch who have support our ID and have given us the okay to use their building and trial this concept for the next 12 months thank you thanks counselor O 'Connell counsel Reeves thanks mr. mayor officers counselors my report is submitted for the record but I want to dwell on one particular point so I attended the mayors and councilors and CEOs rural councils forum in Melbourne and most interested at that forum was a chance to interact with honourable Jala Fulford and the Honorable Matthew guy and a good discussion around social enterprise and community leadership programs now this is a particular interest to me because my business operation we have three staff in three community leadership programs across Victoria and I raised the issue of a variation in the costs of those community leadership programs and also the impediments of those costs especially for social interpreters who are often worth raising the question around just that about that discrepancy between the costs and the impediments to young social entrepreneurs to access those programs and one of my counselor colleagues is a participant in our Gippsland community leadership program now we know how much we value those programs I was buoyed as a result to hear CEO of RDV James flintoff announced and it was probably in yesterday 's budget that there will be an alternative funding model to flatten that discrepancy and to all our accessibility across the state to community leadership programs thanks mister man Thank You councillor Reeves council Buckley Pat Thank You mr. mee I attended the Ann sex was great girl names act and the numbers were slightly down however it 's quite pleasant I also attended at Roy yearly meeting for the cashless cemetry Reserve and that was to just reform the committee and so forth and that went quite okay and they think I 've noticed this over the years I 've done quite a few of these things and they all seem to run at about over 10,000 in the black history at homee Oh shortly after that for the Historical Society and they all seemed to be in much the same position you know in the black to ten plus so that 's about it for me Thank You mr. mayor thanks Council Buckley counselor Ellis Thank You mr. mayor a lot of my colleagues have prepared a written report and like other councils I attended the insect day summing this time of Mike 's entrance of course things I just want to quickly briefly mention inside my report and the one is the considerable work being done by the volunteers at the newly erected men shared Lakes Entrance based on the Paintsville model it 's a real credit to the volunteers which number in potential membership between 60 and 80 people it 's going to be much so what much well reserved Airy well-received project in like entrance wants it up and running and I encourage councillors to have a look at the men shared st traveling through on the following on a new use promotion point of view to deter calories mentioned I 'd like to mention a great College or in a fundraising event for the Lakes Entrance surf club at the school and young young leaders such as Elise and her colleague were able to raise over 420 dollars from a function at this school often we know we 're down the depths you know worrying about the future of their youth but the efforts of these young people was very inspiring and I look forward to hearing more of that particular VCAT year and finally I would like to just touch on attending the similar meetings that counts the route referred to and the inspiration that was taken from that rural councils meeting and also and the more relevant recycling briefings that were I 've attended in Melbourne on behalf of council thank you thanks counselor else councillor pals Thank You mr. mayor I too have a report for our ladies over there and I 'll forward it on directly I just wanted to say we 're well into autumn now and still no sign of significant rain for our region and I noted on the way to council here today on the blackboard they need we all able to let 's all do a rain dance and I thought well that 's very appropriate because in other areas they have done that and maybe it 's something we should be thinking of but a note that our farmers they 're all going into stress mode because they 're selling off their cattle and they haven 't got enough food to feed their animals stored so it is a stressing time for our community out there and and the fact that the few days are on has been entertaining but I don 't think there 'll be a lot of economic stimulus from what 's been generated out there what was that for field days because I know the farmers a hurting and you know it 's a significant time for them so I think a bit more of drought relief would be something that would will be soon coming to our region I 'd like to state Aslan Jones was a guest speaker at the 6 a.m. dawn service and she 's our junior Australia day a reciprocal and she did an outstanding speech between towards the dedication commitment of soldier training and she was very humble in saying whilst a gold medal for an athlete was of significance it doesn 't come in any comparison to the war medals that these guys have fought home or achieved in their time and it was an absolutely fantastic tribute and when I spoke to her afterwards I said did someone give you a hand writing that and she said and I wrote it all on my own and I thought it was just outstanding she 'd written about six long pages we were sort of all captivated for probably a good 15 minutes and I just thought you 're going to be a great leader in future years to come I can 't wait for you to grow up and be a female leader in our community I was really inspired and really proud of it I then attended well there was probably about three and a half thousand people maybe at the bed still mourning I think I 'm not sure about numbers but it was a big crowd I then went on to the to see they had 14 mounted like horsemen me and I refer back to the there was a funding source that our after a grant that I think we might have sponsored for them at some stage and I was delighted to see them all there with the beautiful hat plumage and their jodhpurs and things on but and therefore uniforms and they were riding really proudly on their lovely horses and they had been to almost at the six o 'clock service the ten o 'clock service that I think it was bruising and then there at the eleven o 'clock service at Painesville so they certainly got themselves around they weren 't traveling all that time fine so now it was an eleven I had all I was sorry meeting I was at sorry I do apologize I was at may turn and are at the eleven o 'clock service there and then they had to delay it slightly because they had scheduled the planes to fly over at quarter to twelve and they to delay the service of it but I 'm all in all that was local and interested people so it was a really nice day and lastly I just like to state I 'm a formal thank you for the flowers that were sent to myself and my family about the loss of my mother thank you Thank You council pills Thank You counselors I have a couple of items from the report that I 'd like to just quickly mention the first one was an event the East Gippsland inaugural food wine and beer festival and why I 'd like to speak about this is a connection of the food and our Providence of food for our region the link to our cafes restaurants and other food-related businesses in building a brand in our region of distinction and desire for consumers this inaugural event was a huge success with close to 2,000 people attending this event had something for everyone and was certainly a family friendly focused event he 'd offered relaxed and tempting atmosphere for foodies wine connoisseurs beer enthusiasts and everything in between I 'd like to thank Aaron and Evan from the Dutch oven for having their vision of a industry highlighting growth and opportunity through collaboration aaron and evan worked with restaurants vineyards and breweries from across Victoria and showcased some of the best produce and products available the most innovative award-winning cool-climate wine makers artisan food producers creative award-winning chefs showcased an incredible offering of assorted food wine and beer to all who attended during the same week richard Cornish renowned food journalist conducted a Q&A session at Linda night called food for thought sponsored by the East Gippsland food cluster the Q&A session panelists were all successful local producers and they reinforce the importance of collaboration in building and strengthening a regional brand of product of Providence also during that week ABC gives Landrieu a reporter Isabella Pitt away featured a story relating to award-winning Caribbean chef Alejandra Ceja via who had recently opened a new restaurant in Melbourne called farmer 's daughter this restaurant has a strong marketing an emphasis on only sourcing produce from Gippsland for its restaurant Alejandro was asked what sets Gippsland producers apart from the rest Gippsland is a slice of heaven on earth the diversity of the region its microclimates means same time it has the right conditions to breed the best pasture fed livestock it is the most important deer region in Australia and wild catch fish one of the major ports in Victoria 's Lakes Entrance the next item I 'd like to briefly mention is in relation to East Gippsland as I said CG antennas being an awarded a Australian defense contractor attended this official announcement Linda know where I said CGI based a significant supply contract to supply part of a technology designed to keep truce troops safe from explosions in the field the locally made antennas are a critical component for the suite of robust true protection devices specifically designed for use by the Afghanistan national defence and security forces the Zed CG team in partnership with Australian Defence developed the antennas to block radio frequency transmissions to enemy combatants that can 't remotely trigger improvised explosive devices this is ed CG technology antenna plays an important role in keeping the troops safe from IEDs this is another example of a great escape slaying business acting locally thinking globally it 's also interesting to note that Shire several years ago around grow your business and consultants often in relation to lean manufacturing principles these lean manufacturing principles are designed to help businesses drive unnecessary cost out of their workflows and a system in producing nationally and internationally competitive products and lastly the Australian citizenships was a great event particularly special to me as my parents Pietro and Kamala Carmela took their pledge to become strange citizens some 60 years ago so every time I hold one of these events that is quite a endearing event for me to participate and through our Civic events team namely David Radford we were able to conduct a individual ceremony at a citizen 's house that was unable for health reasons to make it down to the corporate Center that day I know that was they greatly appreciated so thank you David again it was rewarding to see the pride and the sincere thanks in our endeavors in making this happen the event at the corporate center created another key milestone for our organization we utilized our investment in technology to livestream the citizenship event around we 're all everywhere citizenship and it gave people participating for their family and friends the opportunity to come and have a look via the internet connection and watch and be part of that important ceremony for their family and friends taking part in that I must also congratulate our East Gippsland staff members while the Karthik Karthik Venter croute Sherman and Robert Pringle for taking the final step in becoming Australian citizens thank you item five these officers reports and item 5.1.1 East Gippsland Shire Council Grants Program round to 2017 2018 and we have mr. wine Richards in attendance thank you thank you mr. mayor councillors would be familiar with the Community Grants program as the mechanism that 's used to provide financial support to community organizations for a broad range of initiatives in a fair and equitable manner there 's an annual budget at one hundred and sixty one thousand dollars across community projects and the arts and heritage streams which includes the administrative costs and this is the second of two rounds with round two as a high level about type so those 55 applications requesting a total of two four of these applications which is an allocation of 67 thousand six hundred and fourteen dollars this is slightly above the budgeted amount but councilors would note request to increase the budget for the Arts and Heritage grounds which is to be offset by an increase to the Ford 's Theater high income so in a sense its its budget neutral as it 's related to a four seed ahora there were some non-compliant applications but in general the quality of the applications was was really good and as you write from the nicest there 's some fantastic projects that were that were applied for feedback will be provided to all unsuccessful applicants including knives that were non-compliant around their reasoning so the recommendations and an overview of the grants received recommended are attached and I 'm happy to check questions Thank You mr. Richards any questions counselors the council house is moving recommendation as a motion and a second look counselor II like to speak counsel I just like to say the threats funding programs are always great for the community they 're they often present and in between initiatives off the ground for our clubs and things in the region they 're really important to these communities and it 's a it 's a great honor to be able to assist them in some way Thank You council II would do it as speakers a signal it 's no council rates like just not a couple of things that that there 's a considerable leverage and multiplier effect of the grants that we should note there and also that there are there are many people and many organizations who have applied and when you read through the depth and detail of their applications I just like on behalf of the council laws to note and thank all of those people who have gone to the effort of applying and they shouldn 't be deterred and I 'm very glad to hear that we will provide that feedback and that encouragement for those applicants in future because the value socially and financially in the multiplication effect of those grants is significant Thank You council Reeves any further speakers if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor proposal to end section 173 agreement af8 triple one zero g as it relates to PC three seven double five one three at four green court eagle point and in attendance we have mr. hollow Thank You mr. mayor councillors this report is second decision council for incredible support for Lando 's request in section one seven three agreement in relation to four green cord Eagle Point the parent property that created for green court was a head a six dwelling ten house proposal approved in 2004 and a subsequent subdivision of the proposed townhouses into six Lots the following year there was a requirement of the subdivision to ensure that the lamb is developed in accordance with the townhouse permit that was approved councilors a the land owner land owner has purchased two of those plots and has consolidated those laws and is now known as for green court they 've provided advice to counsel they do know which to perceive the townhouse development and they wish to build a single dwelling on the property we believe this end outcome if approved would be a good outcome as it the general residential zone 2017 to be provided the dwelling will be able to respond to current flood levels as opposed to flood levels for 2004 and if the dwelling seats 7.5 meters that will be able to be considered under the design development overlay schedule 14 through a planning permit process councils on that basis there 's a recommendation for a principle support for any of regretted and then the second necessary step of public consultation before returning to the chamber for decision I think second boosters Thank You mr.

Haltom would you like to answer that yeah just just by saying happy to take that question on around it 's not a it 's not a policy that 's directed at any particular political party but we would not have that information and right now so well but we 're more than happy to provide you with an answer to your question thank you thank you mr. Dalton any further questions counselor Ellis now I have that question but I 'm happy to foreshadow moving the notion the recommendation yes should have been necessary if there 's no further questions councillor Alice 's move the motion do we have a second second to counsel Buckley d Gillette speak to the ocean counsels counsel has long had in the position of supporting the timber industry you know as a sustainable industry in East Gippsland the processes and the policy are on councils wish to maintain a sustainable and carbon neutral position as a leader within the community once again I commend the recommendation to Council thanks counselor Alice there any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you item 550 Thank You counselor pills item five point three point two the 24th of April 2018 and we have choir cashman in attendance thank you Thank You mr. mayor I 'm here today to present this report in the absence of the director corporate Miss Mary Ann Bennett the Audit Committee of counsel met on the 24th of April and the report from that particular meeting is with you just to highlight the main justify like the main matters that were actually discussed at that meeting firstly we had an internal audit update from mr. Stephen Toulmin of Oakland services regarding our ICT and BCP audits that were recently undertaken there is a little bit of work to do there from from management 's perspective primarily around the fact that the business continuity plan had only recently been completed and we 're still to do some further testing the internal audit and the plan was also presented to the committee where we highlighted to them their areas of order that we considered were important important this will obviously be discussed with the incoming audit auditing firm that we 're about to engage and from that our 2018 to 2021 internal audit will be presented following this particular report by Miss Liz Collins and smiling batiste I believe so I won 't provide any comment tree on that at the moment the audit committee terms of reference was also presented to the audit committee we took the time to actually read that document incorporates the amendments will be coming through from the local government act primarily they 'll be in that a change of name on the audit community to the audit and Risk Committee and in terms of reference which the audit committee currently acts upon under sorry will now be called the audit and Risk Committee Charter the following matter that was also discussed was a request from the audit committee to undertake a performance evaluation assessment following the internal audit of a preparer edge yeah officers went away and did some investigation with like councils to to scrutinize their current process and the framework that they used to evaluate their own performance and it was led to believe that there wasn 't any significant changes that needed to be made so hopefully they 'll adopting the same type of report was also provided the committee noting with that that this was quite a comprehensive piece of work that was performed by council officers this report actually outlines how we will be undertaking the the SAR evaluation a process that 's due for completion of this year and finally the local government bill the government 's compliance coordinator get coordinator gave the chameleon update on the current review that 's being undertaken men and the committee are welcoming further feedback from from counsel and supporting them through the processes they will be held slight change to that the operations of the audit committee once once this local government bill has been fully acted upon so without any further ado I see that you are note that the audit committee report presented I 'm happy to field any question should you need any further assessments thank you thank you Mr Cashman any questions councilors recommendation moved councillor Reeves we have a seconder for the motion seconded councillor buckley any speakers yes mr. mayor of course just not the CID us and tenacious nature of that Audit Committee and we 're very the record the comments from that Audit Committee mmm who noted an ongoing improvement in reduction in outstanding items despite new and rolling matters appearing as would be expected thanks mister man thanks counselor ease further speakers I 'll put the motion all that all those infants speak against emotional no I 'd like to speak for in favor that we actually write a thank you to the the external auditors or their time on the work that they 've done for a Health Council yeah yes there are internal auditors yeah I think your counsel fails okay I 'll put the motion all those in favor against motions carried your know Nancy thank you miss Cashman item five point three point three is finance report for the nine months with to the period ending the 31st of March 2018 and in attendance we have mrs. Luce of Collins thank you is Thank You mr. mayor this report is for the first five months of the current financial year in terms of our financial performance against the year-to-date result as well as a forecast interview result the report provides details notes to the key variances both you today and for the full year against the adopted budget and here today budget at this stage is forecast that there would be an additional operating surplus of approximately five hundred and fifty nine thousand and that 's a result of a number of items but primarily the result of the timing for capital income we 've received an additional 1.3 million dollars of capital grant funding for sea walls at Lakes Entrance there 's been the timing of the bends Dale Aquatic Center development grant and in terms of that lining up with the timing of the works and there 's also been some funding that 's been provided for bridges in 2017 18 that was planned in 1819 from council funds so bringing all those into account and taking into account of time couple of works program in terms of the interview cash position overall the financial results for the third quarter is in line with what we would expect and what we had planned in our adopted budget for 1718 there is a recommendation there mr. Mayer for councils consideration just like to say there was nothing written least we have finally seen the figures come out about the Raymond Island Ferry I think it 's really solve it not to be summarized in the executive report and I think it 's actually something that comes up in the figures but it 's not actually highlighted and I feel that it should be given the cost blow out of it so I 'm wondering whether there 's opportunity for us to note this report but not adopted counselors you asked us to do a report and that 's what is being undertaken to report back to Council so that work is being undertaken right at this point so if that 's what was requested okay mr. C I can we just have a clarification the report that you 're talking about is the it 's a forensic assessment on the cost blow out of the Raymond Island Ferry two million dollars well well that 's incorrect statement just there the two mean dollars an incorrect statement what occurred was that we are now getting an assessment done on the procurement the operational cost of the ferry and that 's what was requested and that was to come to Council so I think your comments are pre-emptive that we were doing the work that has been already from canceled cancer I 'll share the question I 'm just a little confusion that reported it felt assassin wouldn 't had come from the auditors in the ordered audit report that 's correct and that 's what you 've requested that we have an order report come through that and that 's the process it 's been undertaken as requested what we 're doing but we 're not exactly what was requested to by counsel and that 's to come in to the next order report in the next audit report so we can expect something in the gern report to Council that 's what we 're aiming for think council poem export it doesn 't happen until July after the end of the financial year council I think if you recall you are this is a not an audit report this is an internal audit initial internal order regarding it it 's the audit on the Raymond Island Ferry I think you used to Co for clarification of what we 've got here the figures actually show up in this quarterly reading this nine month period report we 've been waiting to see the final figures and they 're showing up publicly now the bottom line is for the community to accept we have asked for officers to do a forensic assessment and a review of what has gone on with the ferry costings as we feel their exorbitant and I think it 's council 's responsibility to request a further investigation into which the CEO has obliged this week and we look forward to seeing that report as soon as possible and by the end of June thank you any further questions counselors counselor is so moved councillor Reeves to have a second councilors council Tillie thank you speakers look this is a an interim report and there are fluctuations of course in operational matters that beyond our control and the good thing about this council and management of it is that we have the capacity to ride out those variations councillors it 's any further speakers if not I 'll put the emotional all those in favor against motions carried 6-1 thank you Thank You mr. Collins item five point three point four is the capital works and landfill rehabilitation projects report for the quarter ending 31st to March 2018 mr. weights Thank You counselors the report before you outlines capital expenditure in progress with the capital works program for final financial year up until the end of the third quarter end of March the adopted budget for capital works and major landfill rehabilitation projects living carryovers with forty five point two two million dollars as you 'll see in this report as of the end of March actual expenditure plus commitments as in contracts already awarded total nearly thirty six point two three million dollars so eighty percent of the total budget equally pleasing the next page of the report is that of 171 projects 156 of ninety percent of projects have either been delivered or on track delivered as the program so things are tracking very well against the proposed program and against the proposed budget answers are yeah I 'm just thanks Chris just the lights at the rural and regional nav forum last week council councils were warned by the chief executive officer Vav to take note of the on buttons inquiring to the Wodonga City Council and to the application of funds raised under the municipal charge from the management of waste services in their particular council basic allegation was that before some of the monies raised was not allocated to blame landfill and collection services and was directly elsewhere am I reading correctly when I read this report it tells me that we are on track to fulfill using the entire amount of our municipal fees raised under our municipal giant waste charge for solely the municipal waste management councillors obviously waste collection charges Autopia was a municipal judge they were talking about it was the waste collection charges in Whiteface as I understand it with Wodonga their issue was more closely related to the curbside collection charge and the use of that charge because there the suggestion some of that money being collected for waste purposes was not being allocated to waste functions was done of our waste operations whose council still run out as a deficit so we do not collect more money than we actually use on waste management so I don 't believe we are in the same position there 's no word on going Thank You mr. White 's first time thanks for that mr. white sir it 's an important matter because I was flagged the Ombudsman will be looking at all victoria muna councils in relation to the way in which we manage our fees coming in for waste management Thank You councillor Alice council Buckley you had a question thank you is there any sort of a restriction on how much we can put this up like the right cap it 's part of our rates the way the collection fee there waste collection tree could some people assume that that 's got the same cap on it 22.5 how does that sort of align with it I you know as part of our overall rate tax councillor ways fees and charges aren 't subject to the rate capping limit to two and a half percent public comment at the moment as on average I think four percent increases for waste charges it 's not subject to the right cap now he said is there anywhere in the act it covers that and local government ain 't yeah thank you thanks council back cancer I 'd have to take that specific question on notice yeah I would have confidence in our finance department that we have the ability to raise wise charges beyond the right cap this any further questions councils whose a recommendation before us Schneider Thank You counselor Ellis I 'm a seconder councillor I Connell its any speakers for that I know I 'll put the motion all those in favor against scary thank you [Applause] so item six mr. CEO is there any urgent business no urgent business with me Thank You mr. mee this is definitely not a business but that 's what I want to talk about if we could have a motion to just discuss this matter that we change the name from urgent business because that 's a bit over the top of things in our role of there 's general business as it used to be in the past and that 's what I would like the council to just move a motion that we discussed this as as as emotion that the urgent would be changed in general Thank You mr. Toomy okay so you foreshadowed that motion have you counsel but these that were you saying do we have a seconder for the foreshadowed motion and cancel Buckley 's democratic right to put forward nations go one as happy second afford a discussion and receive comments either for or particularly against so that 's been seconded by Councillor Ellis speakers council Buckley well it 's very brief and I have really nothing much to add except that I feel that it 's a much broader and much more acceptable part of the agenda to call it a general business because urgent to some people was not religion to others and general it 's just somebody says clutch that out of the sky first thank you mention to me thank you thank you councillor Buckley will ask car to give us some clarification on that Thank this is obviously the first time that this motion has been put forward but could I possibly recommend that we actually look back at our local law one believe meeting meeting procedure local law to see whether or not that would need amendment should this motion be approved thank you if I may just may speak there we it 's it 's only gov recent times in the last six months perhaps that we 've changed that I 've noticed a change in our agendas to the word urgent previously it had been the words urgent another business and from my knowledge it seemed that it for at least a decade now there might be some reason that they change from can offer that to the consideration I 've known thank you so the suggestion was that we get some more time to have a look at it properly before we vote on anything here yes so I 'll bring an amendment to the motion that the matter be adjourned until the ordinary meeting of whatever date it is in in June sets moved and seconded by Councillor Reeves moved would this require oh well we 'll wait till what happens next month I suppose but does this require a notice of motion to bring it on next month thank you so the amendment it 's been moved that we hold it over to the June meeting it 's been moved and seeing yeah so that we get the information before have to make any decisions all those in favor of the amendment against the amendment now becomes a motion all those in favor of the motion against it 's carried thank you now have a item sentence of contractual matter we counsel me I 'm happy to move that we close the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 8 E to D of the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item 7.1 is this item relates to contractual matters yep thank you seconded counselor Ellis all those in favor against scary _"

CEO item declaration of conflict of interests item 1.4 is the confirmation of the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on Tuesday the 4th of September 2018 we confirmed and that the minutes of the special council meeting held on Tuesday the 11th of September 2018 be confirmed we have a mover for that move councillor O 'Connell second to councillor pills any questions or items that need to be discussed out of that thank you all those in favor against this carry thank you item 1.5 is the our next meeting scheduled and we have a special council meeting to consider the annual report 2017-18 Tuesday the 9th of Tovah to be held at the Corporate Center here in vans Dale we also have this special special statutory council meeting to elect the mayor and deputy mayor for the insuring period on Tuesday the 30th of October also to be held here at the corporate center 00 p.m. and then we have an ordinary council meeting on Tuesday the 32 November to be held at the Corporate Center commencing at 00 p.m. item one point six is request for leave next Tuesday at that special council meeting I have other appointments so I can 't attend noted council rules any other requests all those in favor yes so it was moved by council Reeves I need a second to council polls all those in favor thank you oh I didn 't 1.7 he 's public question time mr. Hsu yeah yes sir mr. mayor we have frequently questioned times two from mr. Morris poor guild of lakes entrance and one from Judith read from Fisher slaying mr. Vogel would like to come forward to us those questions Thank You mr. bourdelle we have got the background to your questions and if you 'd like to be specific to your questioning we have replied to several questions before on the same matter Thank You mr. bell how could you please ask your question yes yes the good medical practice doesn 't apply to race entrance caravel the good neighbor code of practice has never been adhered to in relation to the life sentence for town even in the initial years of the carnival trials where the public where the public and practice was being strictly adhered to at no time during the process have the name has been medically notified of their rights as mandated in the code this is the main reason for the clarity existing is this because as I 've been informed lightly by Chancellor 's Planning Department that the good neighbor code of practice doesn 't apply to cram blame upon which the carnival his arms question does the bird neighbor code of practice as a planning tool apply to cram land or was there a deliberate ploy to deceive the neighbors and public mr. Holden thanks for the question look the first point I would make is that the good neighborhood code of practice for circuses and carnivals is not a planning tool in itself rather we 're a circus or carnival complies with the requirements of the code no planning permit is required to undertake that activity in cases where the circus or carnival is conducted on land that has been nominated by Council for the purposes of such activities there is no requirement to give notice to neighbors however it should be noted that and neighbors which more than satisfies the spirit of the requirement that I just mentioned about which is doesn 't really apply in those circumstances Thank You mr. hull and mr. boogie out you had a second question well that puts the woods does it apply the crane way doesn 't matter um mr. Haltom answered your question what was your second question mr. bourdelle sure it 's person of interest process for Lakes Entrance carnivals the expression of interest process to choose a carnival operator from Lakes Entrance Christmas carnival has been very poorly and in timing advertising and information available to the potential it 's the Bob could you please ask your question well the the was conducted more than the fairest timing goes the eieio was conducted more than sixteen two months before the carnival is to start a io was conducted over carnival operators busiest time covering the whole of the Brisbane Adelaide shows and two days before the Melbourne show as a possible proponent I delivered written questions to cancer twenty-nine days before the close of the AI hoe no answers were seated before three please ask your question not to laughter if you can 't respect this chamber I 'll have to ask you to stop talking can you please ask your question mr. bourdelle excuse me I 've just finished reading yesterday through all the questions that are being asked and most of them have a preamble as well as answers being delayed they were mostly inadequate or wrong though Arthur was not told the camp campaign camping area possibly organized by council that were asked I was told there was no electricity on the side even though for six years operators had been have use cancels on side electric box without asked what parts of their good neighbor coda practices Council considers as applicable no answer was for coming and as far as advertising goes the only advertising for the EIA was in medical papers I 'm like normally and in previous was not can you please ask the question mr. bourdelle in tenders that has a thing that 's a cue which means question why did the poor timing information and advertising occur in relation to the lake sentence Christmas carnival interest for the lake sentence Christmas Carol in a more confident manner pointed out the Aoi has been conducted well in advance of the healthy Aoi for the period beginning 2019 2020 has been conducted well in advance of that at that time which I believe is is is anything but core timing it allows the the carnival to be whoever is operating the carnival to plan well in advance for what they wish to present as part of that carnival so and in relation to the question or about conducting the process once more there was no intention at this stage to re re do that that process for that period of time a second time so we have no intention of repeating ourselves Thank You mr. Holden Thank You mr. bourdelle the next question was from Judith Reed would you like to come forward Judith Judith present Reid perhaps you could read the question just to see yeah they meant to present me so I can 't read the question I 'm happy for you to read the question mr. say after in prison okay we can say yeah I think if you can take it on notice definitely not here so thank you no it was Oh Adam one point eight point one is the assemblies of counselors and there 's a recommendation their counselors that 's moved counselor pills we have a second is there any questions in relation to those assembly of council meetings okay if there 's no questions I 'll put the recommendation as a motion all those in favor against mr. Kerrigan thank you item 1.9 petitions galleries excellent thank you no no mister man so item two notices of motion or or rescission of motion this new deferred business item three there 's no mr. man before we move into counselor reports I 'd like to following a discussion with counselor white I 'd like to move a notice of condolence for dr. Neville Beasley and I 'll read some wording and hopefully counselor white can move that that for me counselor wish to foreshadow moving a notice of condolence following the passing of dr. Neville Beasley of Dillon Park turned back on the 19th of September aged 93 dr. Beasley connection to the East Gippsland region farming at Black Mountain station and then later at delve in park for the last 40 years we extend our sympathies to Neville 's wife Judy and children Nicholas Zoey Sean a former councillor and also mayor of East Gippsland tree and Sophie also the ground children and great-grandchildren to his family he inspired and set a course that they are proud to follow and we stand with them in mourning his loss and celebrating his achievements so moved councillor white need a second councillor pearls all those in favor if you want to add anything counsel what it could be spoken to now if I my otherwise I could do it with my report but um I just like to say that I did attend down dr. Bailey 's funeral because he has been a great friend over 45 years living in this area also a neighbor a trusted friend and it was really really pleasing to see that the chapel was completely honest but one thing that probably came out of it at 93 he still had a vision and Shawn his short time before he passed away in ordered box a dozen bottles of scotch so sure was promised that they won 't go to waste till he should find a use for them but a wonderful mean great tribute to he will be missed thank you thank you cancel what cancel reports counsel O 'Connell thanks mr. mayor I 'll keep my report brief I just wanted to speak about Harriet Ching was in Romeo last month to announce 200,000 funding to through the living heritage grants for the only justice precinct this is in conjunction with council funds as well and the funding will be used for works on both the old courthouse and the new court courthouse the precinct is around 160 years old and in desperate need of preservation the courthouse is an iconic part of romeo and one of east gippsland most prominent buildings so it was particularly pleasing to see the hard work of the members of the only Historical Society payoff congratulations to all involved thank you Thank You councillor Connell council Reeves thanks mr. mayor councillors and guests gathered in the gallery a ten and what I submitted on my report and first of all I attended on behalf of the Shire at AI the Worricker Awards and at the aborigines advancement league on 13th of September and this was a great tribute to the work done by a shire and our officers in our reconciliation plan and the movie that was made for our reconciliation plan and we received a commendation and a runners-up award we 'll pipped at the post unfortunately but we were duly noted as having contributed greatly in this particular area so in a moment I 'll present that to you mr. mayor to hand over to the Shire to display and the second matter that I 'd like to destroy attention to is attending the Y euro a fire brigade at now and our recently and I just checked the data must have been in September fifteenth of September it was and they tabled a copy of a petition that they presented to the local member and have asked us to support and advocate on their behalf for a new fire facility at now an hour and do and we 're all deeply concerned with planning preparation and response around emergencies and at the moment we 're under resourced of now and our their their vehicles are co-located at one of the del Webb sheds and this is not quite as it should be and that is going to change so we hope that um but that will assist the funding of a dedicated and see if a facility they 're at now now in the future so that CFA now now and why you 're or what will be on co-located on two locations in future that 's the plan so I 'm sure that we will support that that petition that has been presented to the local member mr. ball now among other matters what also draw attention to the fact that the Minister for agriculture Charlotte Pulford has visited the Shire recently and made some announcements about drought relief visitors who travel through our Shire there is a bit of a perception that we 're doing pretty well that looks green and it looks quite healthy i compared to the picture on the screen much feed around it 's a pretty grim situation we are drought to cleared and we welcome the announcements from a state government of about five million dollars worth of drought relief packages so there the matters that I wanted to draw attention to that are important for our community at the moment so a couple of symbolic matters some practical matters and also the fact that we should note that many of our farmers in East it 's they and struggling at the moment and what 's most important is that these farmers the recovery time is not going to be when it rains but the impact on their business is going to be three four five years I if they do recover fully in the future so just to avoid bear that in mind counselors but he 's he 's the things I want to present to you if we 're pleased to say that some of our regional stakeholders are also using that cultural awareness video as part of their staff training induction so great resource yeah thank you counselor counselor white Thank You mr. mee only be presiding over the lakes entrance and meeting areas for the church and he has come to the area from the War Eagle parish yes and very pleased to be here and the richness are very happy to have someone there because I 've actually had a I think they called them a locum for about two years in the other it was meant to only have been for a few months so they 've quite happy Thank You counsel white councillor pals Thank You mr. mayor hello counselor evening I had a few things that I wanted to discuss this evening I had the pleasure of attending the high school roller derby skills upgrade it was a in they 've given a certificate which I need to also present to the mayor on their behalf it was a roller derby junior girls program you started by the Kip stone likes roller derby group and basically they were upskilling young girls between the age of 12 and 17 to have a go and get into it and and some of them were really great and some of them were a go and I was really pleased to be in months and it was probably about 19 girls there and and um you know they were really sweet and I was really pleased for them to be able to have that opportunity because programs like these don 't often come into our area and to see the uptaking people actually participating was fantastic so on behalf of the roller derby girls with that said I had the pleasure of having lunch with the Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormick late last month Arica at the Rural Press Club in the city and we were mainly covered with journalists there but there were a few of the die-hard councillors that were actually advocating for road upgrades and things it 's my new role I 'm now the chair of seats for the next two years which is quite a reputable position for an great that we can actually be participating in that as well and the seats group has practice has put out a petition for the princess highway east of sale to Wollongong to be recognised as the road of national importance feel this is a really important thing for the 17 councils involved so I was able to raise that question with him and highlight you know what has been done with that and he recognized that he 'd received that in Canberra through our beloved Honourable Darren Chester and that he would be looking further into it I also asked him to fulfil Darren Chester 's work in regards to making sure that the fuel excise money is spent more fairly in the Victoria gets a fair portion of that given the fact that we only receive about a third of what we should be receiving Queensland and New South Wales have done exceptionally well and happened to mention that it was very obvious when we had a federal minister for roads that those areas were always receiving big amounts of funding which he said oh I can 't be sure and I said I can show you the figures so I was I think in anyway and I 'd also like to state one thing that we didn 't talk about was we had the youth ambassadors around the interesting it 's always a great pleasure to have them come in and chat to us around the table and hear what they 've been up to and what 's helping what they 're doing in their life and how making new events for the youth and that but one thing that was a bit disturbing for me was the fact that they were actually saying to us they have a problem of drugs in and around the community they also said and I felt terrible about it that they can get it 's easier for them to buy drugs at school than it is to actually find information out about drugs at school and I felt sick about it I thought it was just disgraceful that this is how our community has developed I feel we need to do more in this space and be more accepting to what they actually require they were virtually saying to us can you get those people out of our school and tell them to stop selling drugs in our schools and although it 's not our position they actually want to learn and it 's sad but they can 't_''_1466.859 be receiving it although it 's not our system our officers will be going through and and making sure that it 's heard from our perspective that this is a concern for the youth of today and that it really seriously needs to be addressed on all levels whether it be with council the school and their staff and also the police force and the I think it 's something that we need to get together over and address as a group so I look forward to some more working that in the next few months but thank you mister man that 's the end of my report Thank You councillor polls I 've submitted my report but just one key thing that I wanted to mention was the camber region joint organization which East Gippsland chose a member of and we recently met in Canberra a second meeting and was it 's important that we keep fostering that relationship with that southwest New South Wales group of councils in particular snowing Manero and the bigger Valley councils which are our closest can improve our services together and potentially explore some opportunities around tourism and other industry development opportunities with the trip to Canberra was a good opportunity to visit some federal ministers after the recent reshuffle of Prime Minister and and portfolios and we met with Dantean Minister for education to advocate further for our East Gippsland tertiary hub which one of ATS we hope to be one of the eight that will be established across regional Australia we also met with Michael McCormick 's senior advisor Steve Campbell who 's familiar with Gippsland and we also spoke about the bundle of projects infrastructure projects for Lakes Entrance under the Regional Growth Fund we pushed in for when that might be announced but there was no commitment there when that 's going to be announced but the cynic in in me says that perhaps it 's going to be timed around some future election maybe we also met with Senator Brigid Mackenzie in relation to her new portfolio and looking after the million dollar drought fund that 's been announced for East Gippsland and Wellington and unfortunately we did reach receive some further discussions with Minister Mackenzie around some better guidelines the only other thing I wanted to mention was the great support that we 've seen with a couple of convoys of fodder into our region namely from the Lions Club from Pakenham and they did one need for food run and also probably the last one that came through was from the rapid relief team and I thought theirs was really important they work with the rural financial counsellor to ensure they were targeting young farmers that had just got into the industry and make sure that they felt like there was support for them and I thought that was really important so thank you that brings us up to item 5.1.1 it 's a report on East Gippsland Shire Grants Programme funding round one 19 and we we have Sochi Jon 's in in attendance thank you good evening counselors as you would be aware council offers two rounds of community arts and heritage grants annually before you are the recommendations for round one of the 2018-2019 grants program which opened on the seventh of June and closed to provide local community-based organizations the opportunity to access funding for activities that strengthen our communities encourage sustainability promote health and well-being foster cultural diversity and simulate the arts and local economies at frosties attend a series of afternoon and evening grants information sessions were held across the Shire in June to assist community members with their project queries to advise on how to plan and write a project proposal and budget how to access and complete applications on a smartie grant system and to connect program staff with communities locations for these workshops for this round included men to know community hall the Intel library can River community centers which discrete community center benamber Neighborhood House and Geun Gras and Talbert neighborhood house fire phone officers were also available to provide one-on-one support should community members or groups require further assistance in the lead-up to submitting applications this round of grants attracted 47 applications requesting in total of a hundred and sixty-five thousand four hundred and twenty nine dollars to support projects with a total project value of six hundred and fifty thousand eight hundred and fifty four thousand from a wide range of applications which is very encouraging the annual community in arts and heritage grant allocation is one hundred and fifty six thousand three hundred and sixty three dollars there is a community value adding aspect of the program with all funding provided on a dollar-for-dollar matching requirement this means that council achieves more value for each dollar expended expended then the would be the case for projects without these partnerships the 47 applications received were assessed by a panel against the criteria outlined in the grant guidelines projects recommended for funding by the panel complied with the eligibility criteria outlined in the grant guidelines showed strong public value and reach and demonstrated good value for money demonstrated through well-planned projects of the 47 applications received 28 have been recommended to a total of 83 thousand and nine dollars and nine cents and a total project value of three hundred and ninety thousand nine hundred and seventy seven dollars and ninety cents unsuccessful applicants will be provided with feedback as to why they were either ineligible or unsuccessful and support and encouragement will be provided to assist funding through other sources attached to the council report is a list of the recommend approach recommended projects if you have any questions I 'm happy to answer thank you Miss Jones at questions councillors yes counselor pals may I just ask with regards to some of the projects centenary 100 years celebration or recognition oh well one of them 's the bush nursing centenary the other one was the Beanstalk golf club I think and they haven 't been recognised the funding but I was wondering whether there 's opportunity in other areas or if they 've been guided to another portion that they could actually access so if there are other opportunities for them to access funding outside of Council 's funding program they will certainly be assisted to do so but ineligible for our criteria means that we can 't actually support those eggs and though they may be worthy projects Thank You council pills I would like to make a quick comment just on the multiplier and return on investment for counselors incredible it 's you know it 's a four times multiplier and a great as a motion from councillor pulse do we have a seconder councillor O 'Connell any speakers I 've just like to say this is always an exciting part for for us each year time it comes around and to say that the staff do a really good job making sure that it 's all adhere to that the specific criteria is ticked in it 's appropriate for that funding to be spent in that area and as joe said as councillor ratinho said there was it goes around fourfold and 36 applicants have been successful in this round so the 56,000 that 's being applied to will go round thank you any further speakers councillor Reeves thanks mr. mayor I 'm note and agree with your comments about the multiplier effect in the financial sense but we can also quantify the social and community benefits of these these grant programs the the fact that community organizations have gone to the effort of applying for grants receive them the social capital that 's grown around those grants as well is absolutely important and it should also be noted I think yep in assessing them it 's a hard task to say no to some obviously worthy projects but you have done that and and and on behalf the councillors and the community I thank you for that work but also to those community organizations for their contribution to our community I thank you as well Thank You council Reeves any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you next item is 5.2.1 and we 've had a request to speak to this agenda item and mr. Stefan Kemp would you like to come forward please mr. mayor councillors and fellow guests thank you for giving me a little bit of time I won 't take up too much of it I 'm just here in person to reinforce my conviction and then of my family and neighbors in objecting to the planning permit number 174 slash 2018 slash P pertaining to a large illuminated promotional sign I 'm also showing my support and gratitude to the planning officers for their recommendation not to have that planning permit supported with they 're going submissions I just wanted to highlight that the proposed design will negatively impact not only my family it also negatively impact on my neighbors and on the character and amenity of our great little locality in new mirela so thank you for your attention and I trust that the application for the proposed promotional sign will not be supported by council Thank You mr. Kemp thank you would you like to ask mister yes oh sorry in what manner when you say will negatively impact you in your family can you precisely go into that detail I can you know I 'll read it from our super mission cells cast iron script so that sign will be visible day and night due to similar key illumination directly from our residents it will negatively impact on our predominant views from our major living area from our bedroom outside entertainment area as we 've provided in the photographs we think that our quality of life is also negatively impacted because we can 't_''_2192.73 be lucky enough to enjoy a serene room outlook by day and night this darkness unlike that which can or we believe our property ability will be devalued as it will be less desirable for tential buyers thank you any further questions thank you thank you now us mr. Pringle have come forward and present planning permit five points or item five point two point one application 174 2018 fee application for development of an externally illuminated major promotion sign at ten Preston Road new Marella Thank You mr. Pringle Thank You mr. mayor and councillors as stated this report is in relation to a major promotional sign and the proposal is for extra illumination component as demonstrated in the plans that were submitted for councils consideration our assessment has been undertaken in light of the East Gippsland planning scheme and specifically the planning policy framework and the municipal strategic statement as well as the particular provision in relation to signs which is contained within the scheme on the basis of the objections that have been received and on our assess as professionals we agree with the objectors that this sign represents potential material detriment to the property owners and also represents visual clutter in the landscape that although is not that of a commercial nature and we express our opinion as officers that on those basis that we do not approve Thank You mr. Pringle questions councillors council Pels I have a question in regards to your your statement saying that it is not within the neighborhood character how can you define that certainly there is a broad mix in new mirela in relation to the character of the environment predominantly we assess it as a rural Township that unlike other rural townships in our Shire has a history of being zoned for commercial purposes for industrial purposes and and other light industry type activities this particular area being within a commercial zone we understand that there 's not a lot of commercial activity within that zone predominantly it 's a rural residential and even farming agricultural type activities that are occurring today on that basis we don 't believe that a a major promotion sawing is in line with the character of that area being low density or rural style living accommodation and although there is a commercial facility adjacent to the site one commercial facility does the area though there 's a highway present and the highway would I would suggest that you know more commercial activity could occur we don 't think it 's appropriate at this time any if there was more commercial activity there perhaps it would be more appropriate certainly can 't suppose I 'm in regards to the other sign that he 's replaced we say 200 metres down the road what 's the difference between that particular sign and this proposed when we did our assessment for that other sign the presentation to counsel in the application package was predominantly that this was about road safety and the message that came across although that it could be other users the branding that was provided to officers to assess was that of the TAC and we were looking at opportunities to maybe reduce visual clutter in other environments the TAC has a habit of using on VicRoads land their temporary or mobile signs which can obstruct the landscape even more severely so we thought that the consolidation of a single sign within the landscape would be appropriate in that case it under delegation that further applications in this area would be given a higher level of scrutiny based on the potential for visual clutter to be experienced and have you had the discussion with the applicant about not having the sign I noticed in our notes that the illumination portion of the proposal has been taken away and so it is no longer an illuminated sign it 's just a really big sign is that correct yes so the the applicant had proposed to counsel and counsel officers a without prejudice offer to remove the illumination component of the application there was discussion between the applicant and officers about the potential to amend the application to address that and the question was raised whether counsel officer 's position would change council officers position was was not changed and therefore the applicant requested that without prejudice it 'll be made to counselors and they did preface that with although the previous approval had included external illumination as well that component had not been acted on so that that other sawing that have previously approved is not externally illuminated other counselors cancel what down the wrong path but you 've said that it is for commercial purposes that those sites would what would happen if on that particular site a ruling was asked to be erected that perhaps would produce employment in the area possibly be much larger than that situation without seeing an application I can 't comment exactly however a commercial development within a commercial zone most likely a use of the land would be permitted as of right the buildings and works would be subject to consideration and would have application requirements to be met but generally speaking we would likely be supportive against the what had counsel Pels yet never thought council raised did you want to go first in council fells good for mr. bring goodies to clarifies this is a zoned commercial at this particular area because there is the commercial storage units next door and this is a commercial undertaking so it seems consistent and I understand there there are a lot of issues around interpreting statutory requirements around around this so I understand that it 's not an easy decision but we have a precedent existing storage units and the objections are mostly around the illumination and that 's been offered to be removed is that correct yes those are correct yep okay thank you my question is based on John 's particularly on the grounds that he went explained a scenario but if we don 't if we 've already set a precedent with regards to signage in this area and these people have come up with a innovative way of making an additional income which is appropriate to the actual zoning I feel by putting it by putting it a refusal on it it 's showing a bad sign and it 's inconsistent can you explain I 'm finding it hard to consume the the fact that you 've said yes in one spot and no in the other I 'm really not consuming that very well yeah so really each application that we get is based on its own merits but at the same time we do have to consider the amenity of the area certainly amenity considerations come in many forms and I think in this case it represents what values it is a commercially zoned area we would hope that ongoing employment would take precedence in that area and an economic benefit to the landowner yes is an economic benefit to that landowner however in this case we do have to consider whether the economic benefit of ways the visual amenity that is going to be potentially lost through a clutter of signs now the owner of that land this is in canoe Marella may benefit by being able to purchase advertisement space on that billboard on that a major promotion sign however it 's unlikely that they are going to help major corporations that will provide a steady income for that sewing that being said I think the the potential for multiple signs to be erected on that site well we 'll probably only benefit the landowner and the major corporations potentially businesses in the region but I at a greater cost to those businesses than maybe a commercial venture say if those if that land is commercial where to be leased out to somebody to be able to be used for employment which would benefit a greater number to the signage I don 't quite understand well I don 't quite get the difference that we 're limiting this that what you 're putting a hypothetical in saying it may go to a corporate company but what if the corporate company is big freud 's again and they 're putting a safety sign up in regards to road safety usage in the community and within our region I don 't have them can you explain what the difference would be I think in in the case of say if it was being used for road safety there is definitely opportunity for the current sign to be used for that purpose and and again commercial purposes can be used on on that other song that we 've previously approved the change that can happen on those signage it can be done quite frequently obviously less frequent than you would get with an electronic type billboard that can be changed and flash and and those kind of things and that 's definitely not what we want in that locality but I don 't see a reason why we need to are talking about road safety yes it is an important issue obviously in light of recent events in that area however I don 't think that we should be just falling further road safety measures as a reason to to give a grant and approval in this case yep thanks counselor I only had a question thanks mr. Pringle I 'm just wondering if the objectives have been consulted about the applicants change in elimination of the sign would that would that meet their concerns Thank You councillor Colonel I think the the issues that were raised don 't necessarily only relate to the illumination factor the visual prominence in the day time period or was also expressed and because we hadn 't received a amended application we didn 't go directly to the objectors however we did afford them the opportunity and they were notified about this meeting obviously we 've seen someone speak on the motion and I believe that putting words into the objectors moseyed I do believe that they would have maintained their objections thanks counselor Connell any further questions councillors you 've foreshadowing would you on a technical issue we rock we disputed am a an oversight on Roberts but they were still extensively the same but just with some key conditions that that Nate they 're required under this man yes so happily should have distributed that one it 's just a yes certainly just just to explain what your changes are and why are they just reviewed the planning scheme requirements and in my report in terms of the detailed assessment against the planning scheme and noted that there were a couple of key conditions that are reflective a couple of which are absolute requirements that the planning scheme states any decision to approve must contain these conditions you noticed most of them are our condition five has been merged into a single condition with more dot once and it can only be a notice of decision yes it can only be a notice of decision with objections clarification yes certainly counsel um the 15 year date issue of date come about there is a planning scheme requirement in the assign provision relating specifically to major promotional signs requiring that a permit granted potential for an applicant to make a application or part of the application to request a longer time period and that was not requested as part of this permit it 's likely expected that in 15 years time we would see an application made under the planning scheme for either an extension to the permit or for a fresh permit basically requesting a similar time period certainly in regards to the application if it was to be granted this evening if the property is sold does the the permit allow for the new owner to proceed with the same arrangements a planning permit is always tied to the land so in this case if the land was before to be sold that that permit would continue to have life and and be acted on just to clarify again it 's on your notice of decision we can 't actually grant it specifically on the new pieces that Paul Holton has just handed to us the changes refer only to section 5 what was handed out earlier when we sat down yes counselor Paul sorry just to clarify it 's in relation to landscaping requirement so on the previous version that you would have looked at there were a number of independent conditions in relation to what a sign must not do I must not just dazzle distract than those sorts of things but in reviewing the background documentation for this report I also noticed that I had made a suggestion that a landscaping plan be provided to reduce the impact of the pillars to support the science structure with that said mr. Muir I 'm still happy to move the ii recommend the second motion of to grant the actual so it 's a foreshadowed motion yes do we need to read better councils have read and are happy with the alternative decision councils had enough time to read through that alternate much have you got any more question any other councils have any questions on this particular amended or alternative motion if this was to be permitted tonight if we were to grant permission off the signed to be put up and it went to V CAD what likelihood was it that would actually stand I think this is we I think Robert would agree that we wouldn 't be willing to speculate on an outcome at VCAT because it would largely depend on the member and their view of the world at the time so very difficult to speculate on it 's not contrived so it 's been moved by Councillor pills do we have a seconder for that alt count to the white speakers look at disappoints me to not to be doing this because I would have thought the consistency would be the main thing in regards to a sign such as this I look at it and I think for the applicant we would be limiting income potential income for the property and I believe that they 've come up with an innovative solution to alternative a solution to dust grazing cattle on this place to me this is in a Township design of new Marella and it 's an area that we actually have an active business in we 're wanting to promote development in this community and any kind of investment is good investment even if it 's a sign and hopefully it that it gets picked up by roads or the likes of that I believe it 's a reasonable request for the applicant and the block is actually zoned appropriately for this applicant and it 's zoned industrial when I look over the road there 's power works there 's a school there CFA and there 's a metal yard on the eastern side which is all commercial to me and when I look on the west side they 're snowy Lodge Motel storage saw that storage units the sign for VicRoads billboards and then there 's the Meccan sawmill and the BP service station so to me I look at it and I 'd believe they 're all commercial uses and for us to be denying these people of a relevant application to have an alternative income for something that 's not there at the moment I think we 're a mess and we 're not actually being consistent in our application of the planning scheme so for me tonight I actually proposed that the alternative recommendation of granting a application approval for this particular application is appropriate for this to speak as a second yes I would like to think that there would be benefit to the greater community in the almost area because we with the signing of a sign of some of the advertisers advertising is taken up by businesses in or bossed itself we look at the saying that they 've got visitors to the area people passing through I 've got rent about two kilometers to make up their mind as to whether they wish to stay on the highway autocrats stop in all cost and have a look around and better buy some merchandise stop the coffee shop and I would look at that it 's a good thing which we we worry about because of the downturn in the economy and I would think that they should benefit and it give people a reason to pull off the high like and stop in the town and have a look around thanks council white for the benefit of presenter that 's in the gallery mr. Haltom would you like to explain the process of the notice of decision certainly mr. mayor so if council applicant will need to wait 28 days before a permit can be granted during that time the people who object who who wish who were opposing the development have the opportunity to seek a and I 'll seek hearing it began to put their case to VCAT as to why it shouldn 't be proceeded with if BK finds in favor of the proponent then the in those cases the proponent will will get a permit issued by vacate and be able to proceed with their development if the VK member finds in favor of the objectors then that that that application will Thank You mr. Halton any speak any further speakers against the no no speakers against speakers for councillor rubes um I 'm happy to speak in favor of the alternative motion I 've agonized over this and when I saw the original application and it was illuminated I was concerned and I do understand the concerns of the local community of people who live nearby having said that it is a major highway there is an all 24-hour service station down the road there 's a effectively of movement a lot of activity along that particular section so I guess we have to accept that I 'm not being mischievous but I don 't think all commercial Melton is good development counselor pelts but this this is development I think that we need counsel to be mindful that doesn 't turn into three billboards outside every Missouri we don 't want more to is enough I think along there otherwise we know we have set a precedent and we don 't want that precedent to continue but it is a zone commercial and we have to accept commercial activities in a commercial zone I think and be mindful of that when when we leave in those areas or Koko located in those areas but I do hear the concerns of the residents and and I think that having it not illuminated is an alternative sorry a response to their concerns there is a lot of visual clutter along that roadway because it is a commercial commercial strip in terms of what goes up on that 's that billboard I think it is a decision of the the in this particular case I 'm sure that the other billboard may not be TAC forever either so I 'm happy to support it with those conditions that are in place and they aren 't they are stringent they also think that the planners look you have a difficult job in interpreting the statutory regulations and and I congratulate you for the stance you 've taken but the job of counsel is to make decisions and and sometimes they 're hard decisions and that 's the job that we are going now so decision will be made Thank You councillor ease any further speakers if there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against motions carried thank you item 5.2 point two we have a person wishing to speak to this item Maggie could you please come forward welcome Megan thank you a few weeks ago I took my husband away the new men shooting Lakes Entrance and decided to take my dogs for a walk and suddenly found the little park alongside Levitt park which I 'd never noticed before I must admit on their leads because I didn 't know that they would run away however I contacted counselor Ellis and suggested to him that that would make an ideal little off leash dog park having already lots of fences that back onto the properties and a fence on the other side along the creek drainage or whatever it is I figured that it would be a fairly cheap option to put a couple of gates on the ends and some bins it 's already got nice shady trees and picnic tables and things in it and I 've got a response from my email would say been handed on further and I received the information that at this meeting there was going to be a consideration for proposal to declare an off-leash area so I didn 't know which one this was so this is the reason I came a lava pool I was one of the original 124 that voted in favor of the original one that happens to be coming up tonight at Palmers Road I noticed that the the costings on it simply because it 's an evening of fencing and lots of everything is a fairly expensive proposition and yet this little area quite large area at Everett Park would be a quite a considerably cheaper option or possible an extra option for people that perhaps don 't drive take your dog see sirens Palmer 's Road everything 's there basically I know there is some objection from people who whose properties back on to it they consider it their Park and they are allowed to drive in and take their caravans in and this sort of thing but if there was a large gate down one end well there 'd be no reason why they couldn 't still access it and so the reason I asked to speak was just to request possibly that could be an additional one or an alternative one Thank You Maggie thank you yeah sorry yes well I had known it I 'd never noticed myself it 's rather a nice little spot thank you so item five point two point two is a resolution to make an order that part of the forum events that are Bosworth Road landfill site dog off leash areas and we have using the coal guns in in attendance tonight and Nicole 's our senior community laws officer and elke is our community 's laws officer welcome good evening everyone all right so the purpose of this report is to seek Council resolution to effect an order to designate two sites as dogs off leash one of the sites is a section of the old landfill site at Bosworth Road investor and the second is 43 Palmer 's Road and lakes entrance the Ben style site was identified as a potential site through the waste strategy and was approved at the council meeting in December 2014 community consultation was undertaken in regards to the site at lakes entrance as there were two potential sites forty-three Palmer 's Road was the preferred site by the community as it currently stands the domestic animals act 1994 states that it is an offence for a dog to be found at large that 's why the premises of the owner or not securely confined to the owners premises so in order to designate dogs off leash areas the Act animals act our recommendation is that council makes an order under Section 26 of the Act to facilitate the provision of to dogs off leash areas at part of the former landfill site at Bosworth Road and Ben style and 43 Palmer 's Road Lakes Entrance and refers the allocation of the required budget defense the lakes entrance area to a half yearly review of the capital budget and I suppose this has come about through increased demands from the community members for the you know provision to have off leash Ares questions thank thank you Nicole we certainly as councils have received many many letters wanting this to happen you know areas and communities questions councillors council why from our briefings that we 'd had earlier I believe that it 's successful that and and with the discussion we 've just had about every Park that possibly other areas will be identified if it works successfully in that many more places could be dogs off leash mr. Holton would you like to yes thank you mr. Muir I 'll take the litter if you 're responding to that we as we speak consisting of community members from various parts of the municipality to look at the options that we have available to us in terms of actually declaring areas off leash or declaring the entire Shire off leash and only declaring area and certain areas on leash so we 're working through the pros and cons of those of those processors but we are certainly hearing up our efforts to ensure that that requirement and that desire within the community is met through more availability of areas for people to walk dogs off leash Thank You mr. Hawley councilor polls yes in regards to this I 'm just checking that we 'll have provisions for water to be able to water the animals and also sometimes they 'll be I 'm a I know that the excrement bags will be a feature but I cannot have to take it on notice in terms of water but you know if that is seen as being a requirement in that area it is near Easton Creek you know in that area but the we know that there is water at the about across worth row and I 'll have to take that on that as possible so there 's a follow-up will there be any seating arrangements in these facilities first step first step we and and thank you for the question counselor but first step would be to get this declaration done and the second step would be to determine the you know the the pool construction and the amenity of the park and more than happy to come back to Council and and display whatever designs a we end up with in relationships Council Reeves thanks mr. mayor miss gunns thanks for that great briefing as a community laws officer you must have an enviable task at times about enforcement but also education I daresay do you see this in your area of work as an opportunity to be able to direct people and solve some of the issues that you might come across in your day-to-day work and and hopefully that would be of benefit for all members of the community yeah for sure and thank you councilor um it 's one of those things where yes you we 've got at least we 'll have somewhere that we can actually send people we know that not everyone 's going to do the right thing but at least we 've got an option to you know say that you 've got an area and likes and turns and you 're gonna need advance of where you can take your dogs and hopefully that will obviously minimize the suppose the community complaints around people not doing the right thing and people that aren 't dog friendly they want we left alone and yeah one of those its obviously education our first and foremost we want to do that before enforcement and I think this is just an added tool that will just benefit everyone any further questions we have a move for the recommendation councilor pills councillor Reeves speakers Thank You council pose I think this is so liberating and I 'm really excited to be moving this in our community is the first step to dog off leash because as a die-hard animal lover I think it 's really important for the animals to be able to run and it 's socially exciting for them when they get outside and to be able to advertise that we have dog off leash areas for our travelers coming through because a lot of people travel with caravans and their dogs these days it 's a really important first step for us so with that in mind I 'd like to thank the officers for all the hard work and Paul and his team for all the work they 've done on this because it 's only the first stage but it 's been a really important stage for us so thanks very much for that and we look forward to the next step so I 'm please support this tonight councillor Reeves as a seconder would you like to speak absolutely and councillors and members of the public in the gallery we know that demographic of our our community we 're getting older and companion animals in particular dogs are really really important and some of us with dodgy our knees and hips can 't exercise their dogs at the rate that the dogs require sometimes so having somewhere where little bit of social interaction as well because we know how important is and how dogs can bring people together so I think there 's a lot of a lot of community benefit that goes beyond what we see on the surface years old nice work all thank you cancel Reese any further speakers there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in over against motions carried thank you thank you thank you Nicola thank you Oh item my five point three point one Chris Wayans acting manager in this role would you like to come forward Chris its five

CEO in terms of whether of released information we shouldn 't but Goa keep going into the in defense of my opposition to this particular project I believe that the streets gates needed it it will be a boost for the community and the business community of all lost however at this time under the issues of rate capping reduced income for local government there is no justification for such a high blowout on an initial cost I also have a feeling that the streets go probably could have looked at maintaining some of those oak trees that we 're healthy I 'm concerned that we perhaps could have dealt a dagger bit deeper into the knowledge of of maintaining those Street trees there 35 year old oaks and not something you come by every day counselors I encourage you speakers for the motion first speaker against the motion there 's no further speakers all yes counselor I 'm disappointed to hear from counsels I think it 's it 's a sad day that you 're voting against investment in towns in our community I think that the people have almost will be disappointed in that to defer this he 's only going to make it cost more it 'll make it cost more because it 'll go back out the tender won 't be less we 'll have to redo it and if you want to save the money it 'll be a lesser outcome the issue of the oak trees well counselor they have been dealt with we 've had arborist this has been investigated maybe you weren 't at the briefings we 've had out fini infinitum certainly the information sessions we 've had in town this has been consulted on we 've discussed this this is a this is an opportunity for the future just as those people who plan at those oak trees forty years ago thought this is an opportunity this is what we in primary school and st.

    "text": "thank you item five point two point three is the East Gippsland painting scheme amendment C 126 implementation of the Paintsville maritime precinct master plan and we have some speakers or verbal presentations tonight and the first one mr. CEO now the first one is mr. fourth month would you like to come forward mr. Mun Thank You mr. month just press the thank you no worries great he 's gone good I 've never done this before so for stuff up there 's only a couple of us freaking but there 's a lot of the stakeholders here and there 's a few that can 't make it because they 've got commitments they couldn 't get out of and I think that reflects on how serious everyone 's taking this so near the marine industry has been in pain for over a hundred years and it 'll be here for the next hundred no one is trying to remove it so honest though I asked who or what is driving this amendment see you 126 and is so hell-bent on pushing this through concider adopted with total disregard the flexibility to run small business end or build premise other than marine surely other small business to coexist with the marine industry would only bring extra income in the frames of Painesville and can 't pose little threat to the marine industry I 'm opposed to slip road being marine only industry for the following reasons the Paintsville Marine precinct master plan is nine years old navigator the last stand-alone factory to be completed was built around 2009 since then there have been three factory caretakers residences built to which now the council is apart since 2009 infrastructure in the master plan nothing 's been implemented in the Painesville area there are ship rides boat repairs marine mechanics marine fabricators sail makers canopy and upholstery trim it all it 's all successfully working in the marine trade from home-based businesses with little or no overheads and have been doing so for years today these businesses have not purchased land or factories in slip road and why would they when they don 't need to the master plan promotes the Painesville marine industry association pmia and credits its launch for parents the pro an organizing a major boat show the PMA folded approximately seven to eight years ago due to lack of interest and that 's a conservative estimate something that some think it was more like nine to ten but I 'll foot down seven away could it be that the same lack of interest is why the 2009 master plan has not been acted on until now only because time 's running out to implement slip road as a Marine precinct sorry a Marine only precinct will grossly devalue the existing properties in the street or making it almost impossible to sell them therefore causing financial hardship to the owners as landowners we should be allowed to sell our properties to anyone who wants to develop light industry and purchasers should be able to get a planning permit from the council to be able to run his business as long as it is in heavy industry or obnoxious if and when the marine industry manages to expand and requires more land existing properties can be purchased as demand dictates Gippsland ports grab the large majority of the marine sales they have the policy or the plan to be the number one the one-stop shop they had to travel if they get first cracked at all the work there is no other commercial estates in Paynesville for non marine businesses to develop something else in the council agenda Fitz annoyed the executive summary under process states the most prominent of the submissions is the the desire to use land in the precinct for unrestricted industrial and residential use I believe this to be totally incorrect no one is saying they want understand restricted industrial and unrestricted residential use I do believe that existing properties should have some rights including the rights and rebuild their property if it 's damaged by storm fire flood etc when Lynn and I got our planning permit oh I was told by senior tailed planners this is exactly what we want a street full of these would be fantastic Bernie Ryan was told the same thing when he built his fill Henderson was told the same thing when he built this so I urge the councillors to vote no to Klaus see 120 sorry statement to you or the agenda yeah I think it says in there that there 's 15 people for this and I think it 's three against is that right three or five these three no sorry yes there 's 15 to shut it down is three four sorry now well boy I bring that up for is 12 of us was confused the way this letter that came out was written and it goes on to say it says that after we went to that meeting and we saw you all that [Music] written down our complaint and it says that the Marissa Pacific Marine zone is too restrictive and not justified then talks about the caretakers residence we 're saying that it 'd be good for the streetscape and all that sort of stuff and it says in here retain industrial three zone this is that this is their response the councillors response it says in respond to your concerns and others raised the amendment is proposed to be altered and now proposes to do the following retain industrial three zone and therefore abandon the proposal to rezone myself included thought dirty it 's all over and done with put the piece of paper put it on your desk let 's get on with work and business of whatever and it was only until someone else tweaked and pointed out and they said oh you read dot point new Clause 22 and it says in here amend the local planning policy that Clause 21 insert new Clause 2205 and when you go into 05 that 's saying that stick by the master plan nothing else but murray noma that 's basically my summary of it 05 just backs up the backs up to the Paintsville master plan so on the first page they 're saying it 's all done and dusted second page is saying they can not bringing in any air so I 've got a couple of letters here that I think that they 've been emailed you know that it all comes through or not I can just read them out it says the first ones from grapes we 're saved we 've got everyone yeah okay have you got I think if you got like is he got the one from can bounce got that one too good so that takes you talk about I don 't know 19 to 1 I think it works yeah anyway what I was gonna say what up weirds the councillors to vote no the clause 120 sorry seats 126 Clause 2205 and keep slip road open to all non-offensive Lord industrial with factory caretakers residences and don 't waste and don 't send it to another panel or wasting more money anyway we won 't worry about that will we boys and girls to the counselors and council offices my name is Bernie your honor whether you people aware of me I live in super 8 I 've got a bit of a different Arsenal I think a bit differently outside the square but anyway I hope three blocks a lane there a vacant one one with me houses and one where the factories are we came here in 2002 and then the marine industry has changed a lot since then there 's less wooden boats and this is where a lot of the work comes from wooden boats from Sydney in places like that and that 's what was actually happening or may have a wooden boats are moving yellow pains woman I don 't know where they 're going but anyway it could be the tip aware of it there 's getting less and less of wooden boats and bigger and better boats there 's better engines and you can take take example book pulse cruises and here used to have a lot of old timber boats and what have you but no wooden boats whatsoever aim they 've got less of them so the markets going down all that it 's too cheap exploiting barley or somewhere from cruise on the lakes for a weekend boat bits is gone this is just a little industries that have gone on the boat pizzas gone and when I went there I was told bill I 'll build small factories I 'm really Mel yeah small business it 'll take that earn the repair game well I built one factory divided into four I didn 't get one not one small industry the only one or God have an oblate is there it 's got to be more even related no I said he 's gonna paint boats alright we 'll take that thing and that 's here that 's a you know he came to be there that 's true now he looks like going in 12 months because the whole penile industry has changed it 's all become bigger cheaper motors whatever it is in pens I was taking it all the are a CV I 'm getting off anyway yeah might been used to you but the Honda dealership is shifted out of Paintsville I spoke to him about shifting in where the panel bleeder is he said or done over at that only the front office he said if I was going to shift anywhere or rather shifter bends down and be on the main highway we 're getting a lot of traffic most small operators are still said they work at a trails from home and don 't need to be in soup road and I 'll go back going over things again when I built me else the head planner of slip road once architectural II designed houses the front houses in front of their sheds or businesses a long slip road that had been more pleasurable to the eye from the water and he 's quite right if you go on the water there and look at the bloody mess and I was one of those ones that I missed till the shore and made me clean it up but anyway that 's another story but I would think better housing or on the front of the business is their only house blocks at the end of the day anyway you can 't do anything major there now in one of these letters or in part of a council or council playing gold states advanced planning that provides community members and landowners with certainty about the way the land is used and developed use although I have a good think about that because marine related down there might not be the best way for the community to use some of that it might be a bridge over the pedestrian bridge over the canal and you move part of the town the 15 to 16 years I 've been asleep Road no new businesses been chasing Lane in fact three Marine marine related businesses have started up in being sold and the fourth who know this was just one that I just tweaked on to being a fiberglass boat manufacturer has shifted from Painesville to Baines dial yeah we get a little bit of a tricky one here in the council submission keep sewing ports is a critical to the growth and they 're all done to make it more difficult for the small operators my main making it more difficult is they have the travel lift I had the first part of the cherry they run a they run a retail store there themselves you can go and boy you 're a nosy cheaper than what you can up and don 't feel boat bids or whatever they call himself today resin for materials cheaper than you can buy it in vino or anywhere else and things like that and one example was when dirt and paints took them to court over a little court case but it didn 't old and what 's changed since enjoy the zones ruzek those zones to every single restrictive but the poor but maybe but not but the policy is on the plane is not too restrictive but the policy is the master plan put up to cancel yeah it 's the same stuff in this year on the site on the on a different plate for the same now what I mean by that is is what Phil said at the end of the thing what at the end of the thing is he we got the things Bob they 're gonna go for pears it 's a long year and a few other things any at all we wouldn 't throw it in the corner who comes along and says have you read this ivory cause whatever the cause number wasn 't know what what it was was putting back in everything they said they 're gonna take you out renovate why and I 'll over time the improvement and anticipated through the master plan for the foreshore on this section of the public foreshore result in a new community benefit to the reports you 'll see the new community benefit wonder what that 'd be any a bit more reading and I could read into this the skip st. ports want to expand on a publicly they 're already on publicly there were more public Lane or be told in discussions with a CEO of ports that they are there for public benefit because I got into a bit of an argument with him because people in more factories or what I 'm trying to get into factories and the other ones there they can work in a choker right in the ports because they 're not paying a proper read to the state government so he says are there for a public benefit you know when we came here the government tried to profit is that privatize them that 's a bit 15 years ago or deftly oh you go back and chase interview that they were no value there were no takers the value of the infrastructure Lane etc was no way relevant to the income produced and I 'd still say it 's the same today if there and all the men and all the things there they might be getting one percent on their money and we 're paying for that is tax per se taxpayers and we 're also paying for it having factories outside they 're trying to compete again instantly at some level playing field the business that 's our topic here and gives a pair of ports Roy sign under there for a community benefit summing up I believe there 's push for Gippsland ports and not the stakeholders in super 8 at the end of the day mixed-use is a zone that should be there I think which gives us a lot of things to play with and not if you put in the mix own not putting 20 2.22 0.05 inserted into the zone master plan which is what we 've got today if you want to ask me anything about that afterwards or anytime there I 'm quite happy to be you unaware I get not where I got the information from but we 're off fenders and stuff like that thank you very much thank you councilors once amendment and council and its role as the planning authority so the process I guess that the planning authority the key purpose of councils roles of planning authorities to support good decision making to make and to make it in a way that generates the most benefit to the community and part of that involves council planning for the future and forecasting the future and using the planning scheme tools to make sure that we 're actually able to get the outcomes that we believe are important for our community so Painesville is growing and recognizing that that that growth is happening and planning for that and appropriate economic activity is part of the role of the planning authority bar burger island and slip road the slip road areas a key part of town that has a significant role in supporting recreational boating infrastructure it 's got a key locational and economic advantages when you look at the combination of both the public and private land and the access to the waterfront in that location and that vision is captured by the precinct master plan that we 're talking about master plan and that vision is to ensure that the way that the planning scheme is amended supports good decision-making over time on a site-by-site basis so that the overall objective of the precinct can be achieved by putting the controls in the planning scheme it means that council has the ability to make fair and transparent decisions about land use in this part of the municipality and that the outcomes that have been sought and agreed to through the planning scheme amendment process are clear when it comes to making subsequent decisions do we always get agreement on the best outcomes all the ways that the scheme might be used to do this no we don 't and that 's why the planning scheme amendment process is like it is it is the way it is because there are significant processes and checks and balances when we look at changing the way that people can use and develop their land so in this case councils work with the community and stakeholders to prepare the master plan for the precinct that was adopted by council councils twice considered the proposal 's been exhibited and comments both in favor and opposing have been received we 've considered those gone through an extra process to understand the submissions and try to see how we can respond to those and we 're now asking council to consider a revised approach to the amendment and importantly whether or not to pursue the amendment at this time or if further submissions and refer the submissions to an independent panel or alternatively abandon the amendment either wholly or in part so that the planning process includes a number of opportunities for people to get involved in the process people who have an interest in the outcome there 's a number of review points both by Council and the Minister for planning including the opportunity to refer matters to an independent panel appointed by the minister to provide counsel with advice prior to you having to finally determine how you would like to see this matter progressed through the planning scheme in this case the planning scheme amendment proposes a range of changes to the scheme to support the implementation of the the precinct master plan the our assessment is the concerns presented by people who own land currently zoned industrial 3 in the precinct and you know we started out with this proposal and yes it 's taken time to design the controls and get a get permission from the minister to actually progress the the amendment in the format that we first exhibited because it 's not a straightforward process to simply get authorization to exhibit an amendment where we started with was with a special use zone designed specifically to support applications being made for marine related industry it was a sone different to the industrial 3 zone because it limited the range of things that people could do to things that might realistically be supported in a marine industrial precinct we 've changed the proposal presented today to retain the current industrial 3 zone the distinction between the there 's a significant distinction between the zones and the way they control applications that can even be made for consideration by counsel so it opens up the range of things that people can apply for in the industrial through zone compared to the special policy to support good decision making on a case-by-case basis and if you look at the words in there it 's not explicit about what can or can 't_''_1566.13 happen it is designed the policy is designed to guide the discretion that council exercises either council itself or delegates so planning officers in understanding the range of uses that might be appropriately justified to go into that area whether they are marine or not so it remains as a industrial 3 zone we don 't believe that the amendment should be as officers don 't believe it should be adopted if we can 't retain significant portions of that policy because that is the justification that supports the amendment and the future decision-making whether it 's about marine industrial marine tourism and public land development so I guess the proposal that 's being put to you today is about a comprehensive and integrated approach to improve the planning controls in this part of the precinct the concern relates primarily to the industrial land and we remain of the view that protection and enhancement of the maritime precinct and supporting the land-use outcome that provides benefits not only to the town but for the region the proposal before council is not proposing a marine only precinct and there would appear to be a lack of understanding about how the controls will be used by council to exercise that discretion and I understand that these things are technical and complex but it happy to elaborate right on that if counselors would like but I think the key point in here is that the process today has elicited submissions both in favor and against the proposal so there are different views in the community about how this matter should be dealt with and given that 's the case then officers are of the view that the most appropriate approach for counsel to take is to refer all of the submissions received to an independent panel the panel process enables councils and submitters to present their position on the proposal and take independent advice on the most appropriate way to proceed in the circumstances the independent panel is established to sit and set up to hear everybody 's perspective on the proposal and they what answer they conclusion they should come to that report would be represented to Council where you would have a further opportunity to determine what the final position is that council would like to take in the context of advice about all of those matters so our recommendation is that you refer the submissions to the panel happy to answer questions Thank You mr. Nelson questions council what thank you mister me miss Nelson just perhaps for benefit from some of the others around the table in so in inclined terms this what was discussed before of course 21 in use new Clause 05 what will that actually produce is that does it make it more restrictive still I think the the distinction that needs to be made here is that the starting point was a zone a special use zone which is very specifically about what you can what you can do as of right so without a planning permit what you need a permit for and what would be prohibited in the zone so it would limit some proposals that would be currently allowed in the industrial 3 current zone so no change to the zone but to provide council and the community with transparent advice about the overall precinct and the policy that would be used to exercise discretion it 's not explicit about what can or can 't_''_1826.2 happen but it provides guidance about the types of land-uses that might be preferred but it enables Council to accept applications and exercise discretion about what would be approved on a case-by-case basis Robert thank you mr. Mann miss Nelson at one of our briefing sessions we had a discussion about this taking it away from a rezoning in refer making it a referral document for lack of a better word when it was discussed it was indicated that it would still be preferential to maritime generally so it would be still a maritime guided area however there was the possibility to put in a application to have other applications considered what would be a trigger that would be approved by the Planning Department oh that 's a I guess a theoretical question I 'm not sure I can actually answer that exactly but if you look at about for example to ensure that industrial land in the maritime precinct is not unnecessarily occupied by non maritime users so you know at the moment there is no there 's no alternative industrial land in Paynesville so if a use was proposed then the officers would have to consider what the alternative options are for that landowner and determine whether this was unnecessarily occupying no you know that the industrial land in this precinct you know if the language is around adequate are not unnecessarily define and consider it it provides guidance for officers to exercise discretion it is not a black and white rule about what you cannot can or cannot apply for and it 's designed like that because we don 't know what circumstances might be put to council you know caretakers dwellings continued to be allowed in the industrial three zone so you know the the view that is being put that you know something is significantly changing in respect to caretakers dwellings and whether they have a role in the in the precinct hasn 't changed the the distinction is that it allows council for it allows Council to exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis thank you so being that there is no other industrial zone land in Paynesville would any light industrial application be permitted until a time that there was additional industrial zone land I can 't_''_2006.549 say that because I don 't I can 't say yes because I don 't know what the circumstances are or what 's being applied for but I but I can say that if it fits in the industrial through zone then someone can make an application and it can be considered in the light of all of the considerations that we would normally put 2205 is the sticking point that 's been referred to the insertion of 2205 and 2205 is a local planning policy the Painesville maritime precinct master plan there 's a bit of discussion around of being a bit old it 's referenced from 2009 or even earlier there 's some concerns around existing use and and you 've just mentioned then that any plan application would be based on a reference to not God guided by referring to that particular community members that there 's a change in the shift in use and is is this master playing too rigid at the moment and that 's the problem I think that I 'm hearing from community members that that at some point in the future if we adopt this there might be a discretionary view from somebody who we don 't know yet who might say this is the policy and the proposal doesn 't fit into this particular policy so you can 't do it how can we have that flexibility and still have the intentions I think up one planning minister one time said that we were going to have certainty with flexibility in the planning system and okay I 'm not sure look it it 's I guess the the way you try and achieve that is by being clear about what the development outcome is that you would like to achieve through policy and you design the the tools to provide guidance so that when officers receive applications which we can 't possibly anticipate might come in that there 's sufficient guidance there to be flexible we use the the combination of policy and zone controls to exercise good judgement about what should happen in particular zones and we use the zones as a tool for deciding what people can or can 't apply for policy is is that thing a good thing or not so in every zone there are things that you 're allowed to do without a permit there are things that you need a permit for and there are things that are prohibited and the combination of the zone land use controls and the policy is how we get the flexibility yep the policy the policy and the master plan provides a level of strategic so see about that outcomes that we 're looking for but that outcomes are achieved through site by site decisions yep and then an interpretation of 05 yes by somebody and that 's maybe I 'm struggling with an unlike with how to remove that discretion and put more flexibility that 's what I 'm saying well as officers I think we 're basically saying and having regard for that all of the views that have been this special use zone and relying only on policy to guide discretionary decision-making rather than being explicit about what people can or can 't apply for being linked directly to the maritime industry whether it 's tourism or boating or other things so what we are saying maybe I 'm saying it in a kind of messy way but we believe that we have built that flexibility into the process I don 't believe that we would be successful in progressing a planning scheme amendment if we were to lose too much of that local planning policy because it doesn 't provide anyone with any guidance about what we 're looking for to happen in this part of Council and you 'll notice the policy at 05 does deal with the broader vision for the precinct it 's not just about the industrial land it 's about the way that this precinct is facilitated and protected into the future and you know you just have to look at how hard it is to to get this through sure that the plan is old but we 've had the economic justification we met in Paynesville so the economic justification for this the locational advantage of this pricing in the context of the growth in regional oh sorry in recreational boating activity and its function and contribution to the economy in Paynesville like that 's that 's a sound basis on which to proceed this this the industry itself might be changing I don 't think you know I 'm not going to dispute what people who are working in industry is saying but this isn 't all about boat builders this is about tourism opportunities it 's about you know depending on how creative people can be about what you can do that links to and makes a more vibrant recreational boating precinct we 're basically saying let 's be really careful about how we use this nearby I don 't know where that where you 'll find another location where you can promote record promote and support recreational boating activity it 's not all about boat building and both boat fixing it 's about boat related tourism and other things very long just it follows on from council arrays really Ryan spoke about that in nine years we haven 't seen any real development in the industry it 's changed so are we sure that this precinct will actually be needed going forward given that in in almost 10 years we haven 't seen that private investment coming we haven 't seen that sort of thing developed so we 're putting a lot of eggs into one basket look I 'll go understand the concerns of the the land owners I mean we don 't change the planning scheme for no good reason and and that 's partly why we 're recommending that we refer these applique all the submissions of the proposal to an independent panel but let 's have someone independent have a look at it the reality is that the Sherriff been styled had a policy in their planning scheme which started this whole concept of the maritime precinct here it was part of the original vision for Barbara Island when it was created by the canal construction by the location historically of the slip yard and the boat ramp and the other things that happen in as you know from the site inspection we did there 's a lot of boat related activity happening already in this precinct that hasn 't just happened by accident sure there might not the demand might be different at the moment but what we 're really saying is in your planning authority role we need to be conscious of making sure that we don 't lose future opportunities here yes at the moment there 's no alternative industrial land but there whether we 're the closest we 've ever been to having that alternative and the lining up of the this process with our the future planning for Painesville puts us in the best position that we 've ever been to achieve both those outcomes for Paintsville Council to want to highlight the advantages to residents I guess it depends your on your view here because there are landowners in slip road who are in support of this proposal so they think there 's value in focusing our energy on making sure that this area develops as a marine related precinct whether it 's on the private land or the not just what happens in the industrial and if you if you don 't think that there 's enough flexibility built into the proposal that we 've presented tonight then you might not be in favor of it from industrial land use perspective and the fact that there are those two quite different views as to me that we should get we should refer this to an independent panel and we should get that advice before we finalize this proposal and have Council formally form of you about whether this has got merit or not certainly counsel in regards to that thing so I 've spoken specifically about the land there so what actual benefit will have to the broader community of Painesville and ice-cubes land should we accept this there 's a number of benefits in that from a public land perspective we 're confirming the tourism and open space and other plans that we have out of the master plan there you know there are a number of in terms of the economic benefits Painesville and the economic contribution that both related activity whether it 's tourism or to people who work there it basically means that Painesville can really if we if we allow this to go ahead as is really genuinely be seen as the recreational boating capital of the gibson lakes so it 's a massive marketing exercise it 's an attractive for people who want to live here it offers by the water support to tourists and other people visiting there there 's a range of benefits the challenge here is that the local land owners don 't necessarily view it as being bringing the same benefits so what I 'm saying is let 's have someone let 's have someone evaluate whether he 's got merit or not counselor Ellis you had a question Thank You mr. mayor I 'm just got a number of things have been running through my head as a result of the detailed response Canton 's not spin all the providers with this but we still haven 't_''_2725.24 been on the good ever and under the questions that the residents of slip road the business or residential arise to whistlin these are questions that must come back to a panel so I 'm still very uncomfortable so my questions are this can can I 've been reading 05 and going back over the policy or the plans can can you explain to me clearly what is the boogeyman in 20 2.05 but that has got our community so concerned a bit what is that the actual words I I didn 't hear you around mr. O Brien or mr. Mundt actually say what it was I just referred to it as a trap and I 'd like some explanation for a start as a first question please yeah well I don 't know exactly but I 'm assuming it is the section that 's headed marine industries so there are four in marine industries in 2204 there there 's a heading marine industries on page 220 of your document for dot points that would be used by planning officers as part of their consideration of any application for land use or development in the precinct so it still links it back to the overall precinct but and there 's some general words at the beginning but I suspect that the other other things are well generally about promoting economic employment activities integrating the precinct into the wider town you know they 're all good planning principles for boating users I don 't think there 's anything particularly detrimental there in terms of it you know recognizing development around boat launching facilities and the kind of things that both the boating community is going to want to access and quite specifically there are some tourism initiatives containing the the master plan as well I don 't think any of those things are particularly I don 't think any of the other things are particularly wearing it 's it 's about industry related activity I suspect but the wording is written in a policy sense it 's not rules its policy policy provides guidance on exercising discretion so with that explanation is there any threat there for for the activity to the activities and the businesses that have been carried on there now are the objectives that we 've outlined in 05 point three in direct conflict with the activities that are carried on in the precinct disease or in not changing so any land-use that 's allowed to be in that zone is legally in that zone there 's no change as a result of this this planning scheme amendment so people you know in the previous proposal with the special use zone there was more risk that some things would become non-conforming users we 've eliminated more we 've eliminated the situation where more of those things will become non-conforming Yuson so there 's a benefit in the in the way that we 've changed the from the special use zone well sorry shifted away from the special use zone and retained the the current zone there is no change to the zone or to existing uses in that zone further question so many I 'm just not sure where to go I think the I 'm not moved to the concept of adopting an approach on panel and and ask I 'll put it this way in the tender process in the assessment of a tender various aspects of the tender awaited and given a value in the object in the consideration of a panel is there particular policy or plan brought before that panel is it held in a high a higher level than perhaps just general conversation there 's a start I doubt it there 's anything that explicit there 's a no hierarchy of planning principles that a planning panel would have to give consideration to the state policy how this set of how this proposal actually works to advance the planning objectives of Victoria there 's a whole range of things that they would have to consider the process specifically recognizes the the role of submitters to the president we wouldn 't the process wouldn 't allow anyone who has an interest to make a submission to this wouldn 't do that if we weren 't interested in understanding what people have people were impacted by it the with any planning process and objection it 's not about numbers it 's about the substance of the submissions made whether for or against and that 's what the planning panel will be trying to weigh up what is the substance of what is being told to us here are the plan are the planning recognized you know that the industry has changed are we being unrealistic about the way this land might be used into the future is there justification for providing this policy context for making decisions here in Paynesville at the moment so that they 're the questions that they would have to answer it 's about substance not numbers or who 's made the submission it 's about what 's the substance of being what 's being put to the panel councilor Aames if you have a question okay I 'll come back to thank you planning panels getting in and view the planning panel will make recommendations about c1 to six not 2205 is that correct because see 05 seems to be a sticking point in some content therein so yeah can can we refer this without adopting c1 2 6 10 no no so so 05 together with the reasonings that we are proposing so some general residential mixed use and public use zone and a bit of flood overlay together with the words that are here and I know it 's long but 2205 is part of planning if if the council 's of a mind to refer it to an independent panel we would refer the whole package all the submissions our assessment of the submissions the panel would read all that information that would come down and they would hold a hearing people would submit they would ask questions and then they go away and make a recommendation the way it works the Minister appoints independent people with the appropriate qualifications for the issues that are being raised so it 's not that they 're experts in their field and the field the field that deals with the issues that we 're actually dealing with here so it 's designed specifically to provide guidance because sometimes as I say there isn 't agreement in fact regularly there isn 't agreement so the system supports helping councils and the minister come to the right conclusion about what the nature of this change is because you don 't do it lightly in your introduction you said about an alternative recommendation of abandoning the planning scheme you said wholly or in part so in part what could that mean be it may be that council wants to explore other changes or changes other than the ones that we 've recommended tonight to the plantings can amendment I I think that if you were going to do that and we 'd be happy to work with Council to do that then you should defer consideration tonight while that can take place because I can 't unpack this and put a recommendation to you about an alternative on the spot tonight that requires further conversation yeah so the question so sorry add one thing I do need to say that is if you if you are over mind to modify it further on the basis of the submissions that we have right now in support and against you will most likely end up at a panel anyway because you 're not going we 're not going to guess but we 're probably unlikely to get everyone to agree because not everyone agrees now so you know some people are happy with this will they be happy with a change so I just caution you that you 're going to end up end up at a panel probably anyone yeah thanks okay look I think it 's been you 've been really helpful in explaining things and I think everybody 's on the edge of their seat listening to this and I sort of having read this and understood that we 're probably going to end up with a panel anyway and there 's a few nods in the background and this might be a way to progress the matter without actually adopting the scheme at this stage so we get a much better outcome before we progress or yes um so the recommendation at the moment is to go to a panel you 'll notice that adopt that amend the amended proposal that we 're putting to you so we 've amended the documentation so this this would be going to the panel without the special use zone but with the policy and the officers have to go with a position on behalf of counsel so we have to go and represent an argument and we 've set that out in here but it would become very clear to the panel cautious about what the right answer is so we would we would make that clear in our submissions to to the panel part of that process okay cancer Alice did you have a follow up question and then cancel Roberts yeah I think of nothing counsel reasonably you know we 're going the same place I 'm just trying to assess the situation I have it on the desk in front of me and what do I have used one is to reject the application before council and vote against it two is to unnaturally support the motion and then there 's this third option and on yeah and to defer any decision-making but still see if we can take it to a panel and that 's the question I 'm leading to now because I 'm twisting between in with this because we 're the decision makers the penalty considerations will come back to Council if I don 't misinterpret this and we could still end up having to be in the same place again in some months time and having a lot we have wrestling with the same reject it fully so those words simply litres a question can we defer the matter to the panel without adopting losing seat 126 no you have to you have to make a decision about what it is that you 're referring the to the panel all right if you don 't adopt this modified planning scheme amendment C one to six documentation appendix on then we 're reverting back to what the original proposal was that was exhibited okay so we 're asking you to adopt that because it has to be something that the panel is considering you can 't go there vaguely and say can you help us work this out Council Robin if if council was to support the recommendation that 's before us it says that would adopt the planning amendment and see 126 documentation and Appendix 1 but then after it was adopted then refer to the Planning panel what would the benefit of referring it to a Planning panel be if it 's already been adopted oh well we 're asking council to take a position to put to the panel okay after the it 's a good position or isn 't it you know having everything what would I recommend what would the panel recommend to council it 's not like VCAT they 're not telling you what decision to make and making a recommendation that report comes back to Council then you decide whether you 're going to endorse it and send it to the Minister for approval because in the end it 's not us that approves that it 's the Minister for planning so there isn 't there are two more steps in this process well three and then thank you for that for that answer I hope it 's cleared a lot in in where we 're heading with this but my final question and then are there coffees what impact if we were to support sending it to a panel would that have on members of the community there 's a lot and they 've given up the atone they 've got to run businesses and be at home with their families in the cold nine degree night what impact will that have on them in terms of costs involved to them or any other inconveniences I think the committee deserves to know what happens if we make a particular decision well I think if you 're gonna defer it it just drags the process out to be honest so that drags a process outfit everybody unless we think that unless you think that by further discussion before you refer it to a panel you somehow get a solution here Kade I 'm saying what say we disappear saw it to send it to a panel what what are any potential costs inconveniences commitments etc the members of the community affected by a decision-making process can incur well the panel will be held locally so it will be held during the day hopefully not 9 degrees and it will it probably doesn 't require them to do any more work than they 've already done in terms of the presenting their case but that 's up to up to individuals about whether they want to take specific planning or legal advice about representing their position depends what level of importance they want to put on it it 's people to public hearing people can sit in it for as long as they like or they can just come in and do their bit but it 's generally managed as a very inclusive process it 's an inquiry if you like in terms of understanding the circumstances so that people can make a so that the panel can make a genuine recommendation to council having taken everything into account and that 's that 's the role that they have so it 's it 's local it 's informal or as formal as you would like it to be I 've got a question from councillors I think council pills did you have a car yeah so my question is that if if we adopt this and so this is a position but it may not be the position that we think is basic the way that it can be modified is to get these people to go to the panel and convey in no uncertain terms of the panel that they want that changed and the panel can then come back and say you got it wrong council this to adopt that this is the process for that voice to get into that change is it correct that 's exactly right look at this if there 's concern about the use of the word docked in the recommendation that first word we could say indoors then it just needs to be clear that council is sending this proposal to the panel yes any further questions counsel to e mr. mayor I would like to foreshadow an alternative motion would you like me to read that out now okay my alternative motion would be to that council as the planning authority for East Gippsland planning scheme and having considered all relevant matters results 20.1 abandoned planning scheme amendment C 126 relating to the implementation of the Paintsville marine precinct master plan in accordance with section 23 1 C of the planning environment act 1987 and to brought to the Minister for planning in accordance with the SEC with section 28 of the planning and environment act 1987 advising of council 's decision to abandon planning scheme amendment C 126 counsel Buckley Castle I would like to very much thank you having worked down there for nearly the last 20 years and having seen the way things have progressed if you can refer to it as that I have to concur with the earlier speakers who are against this proposal it 's far too limiting and it 's it 's not in my opinion what this particular area NEADS there 's a lot of other things that this particular area does need but limiting the ability for people to run a business down there to just marine style businesses is far too limiting when of course there 's no alternative industrial and in Paynesville and there won 't be for between two and five years depending on how things work out so in my opinion this is it 's not it 's not suitable for this area people have made decisions based on council 's position that is other than this and they have spent a lot of money with the knowledge with the knowledge that they were given at the time to change this position now is it 's just not fair in my opinion it 's not fair this in that area and and all people of Paynes well I must I must say you know they potentially will be forced to go to different areas to to get services that are other than marine so I wish to pursue the the motion as I felt as I 've stated thank you thank you yep Thank You councillor tui council Buckley would you like to speak to the ocean there 's a second no I think that 's quite adequately covered Thank You councillor tui speak against the motion look I will reluctantly and I I do hear the concerns of the community but in abandoning this I think that we 're going to end up at a panel anyway we 're gonna have to start again and we 'll end up back at the same a same point and it might just delay an inevitable decision that 's that 's my concern I think there was a way forward in a position to take and a way for the community to express their views and modify the planning scheme and now we don 't have that and that I 'm speaker for the motion Council why I 'd just like to say that if we go with this potion and it 's kind of it gets up that possibly one of the things that 's been holding slip right back is putting probable this uncertainty for so many years and if if we just make a firm decision on on the fact that it can remain as an industrial area lot industrial area we may actually see some development there and and with a bit of help from Council perhaps and some beautification on the on the foreshore area just to make it look a more appealing area so well that 's my thoughts on it thank you Thank You councillor white there any further speakers counselor Ellis I wish to speak against the motion I in certainly support councillor Reece worked we are faced with a panel whether we rejected this evening or adopt the initial recommendation paints Willis in the period of transition in terms of growth and and and there such is recognizing the need for in just industrial lands to be made available I in this discussion this evening I 've heard countless direct and Nelson outline a series of options and considerations for us if this is an emotive matter and need some sort of independence and I think a panel will offer that making it now is like cutting your nose off to spite your face in the sense that we reject this a lot of good work and a lot of the the policy will in this document which provides for the benefit of that wider in business community of pains will will be gone and at some time into the future we will have to develop a like plan whether it 's called marine plan or called the light and us plane or the concrete plane whatever it might be called under the state the planning laws we will have to redevelop but will really be reinventing the wheel so in those cases I encourage cancers to reject the emotional counselor to ease even though I do respect the point and concede in the talents for immediate decision making I think adopting miss Nelson 's a position is probably most with it or not it 's like a VCAT matter Thank You counselors Thank You counsel further speakers a open negotiation with the committee in all aspects I think they 've done with this project has been quite outstanding with regards to my fellow councillors Reeves and Ellis I agree that this will go to a mediation to a panel of some type anyway and I believe that we did have a position to move forward with the whole concept and there were some great things in that concept plan there were some really important issues with regards to the port and the amalgamation all the development of the police precinct and also the foreshore at the the unattractive end of there I think basically as you drive in and I think there 'll be things that will be lost should you not support should you support councillor to ease position with regards to the whole scenario well I think we 're actually struggling to come to a happy medium here and probably the best import of it all is to have to send it to a panel hearing and I won 't be supporting councillor to E or Buckley 's recommendation any further speakers for first speakers against councillor he has a right of require Thank You mr. mee I 'm very averse to making a decision based on on something that may occur regardless of how this turns out this will be a question that we have to answer ultimately anyway even if it goes to a panel it will come back to us for a decision we will have to make that decision as to what we 're doing down there now from my point of view I see that we we have spent a considerable amount of staff time on this on this proposal that I personally would have would have far rather seen that time spent at Linden er creating that plan out there when it 's patently obvious from the community as per what we have here tonight that this is not what our community wants and we are here to serve our community and to look after our community and to take into account what our community is telling us and I don our community wants and I don 't believe it 's what it 's a decision that they want us to make and I understand that there are planning issues I also believe that we can address some of those issues down there separately but I cannot support the motion that has been put to us and I would ask people to support my alternative motion thank you thanks Council to either be no further debate I will now put the motion all those in favor of the motion one two three five against motions carried forth either my five point two point four is the man amended planning permit application 41 3 2016 P V application to amend the wording of condition number nine of planning permit 41 3 2016 3 at 27 Golf Links Road Lakes Entrance mr. Muir we have a speaker on this mr. Benedict is early mr. Bernardo Guardi would you like to come forward please now welcome mr. gazzarri Thank you Thank You counselors and thank you for the opportunity to to be here tonight and to 1to for the opportunity to really explain the absolutely critically important first I 'd like to identify myself I 'm Veneto Azadi I live in Tyrolean I 've lived in Gippsland all my life and for many years conducted a large petroleum distribution business in the region the Golf Links Road property was acquired 12 years ago and is held as a family and superannuation fund investment by best rate views proprietary limited on behalf of the gazzarri and howlings families my company has always sought to deliver a project that met all the needs of the shire would benefit the local community and especially those who will the the long-term users of the project when it 's completed I know we have sought the best available advice use the services of the best available specialist consultants to come up with a project that delivers and achieves best practice during the process myself and our consultants have met with or exchanged correspondence with Shire planning staff namely director Holton and director wait Erin hollows her manager statutory services and Martin Ireland who I don 't think is here this evening this was done collectively or independently on at this project I felt confident we had reached a position where we had effectively ticked all the boxes and we were ready for works to proceed until the planning permit conditions were provided in somewhat alternative form to what had been foreshadowed and agreed we were totally unaware of the conditions contained in point nine got points one and three until we received our copy of the official planning permit it was then we discovered my company was required to fully design and reconstruct the whole of golf-links Road the whole of golf-links Road and the infrastructure to the shire specifications and pay 100% of the cost when we learned about the conditions we immediately protested and bought the planning staff attention that we were unaware of point nine conditions and pointed out that we had already contributed significantly in the past under a previous planning permit which required my company to reconstruct approximately two hundred meters of golf-links Road from the princes highway to the residential development on the north side of golf-links Road so we 've already expended a huge amount of money on that road we also golf-links Road intersection with the princes highway the safety upgrade construct the north side footpath and it was our company that offered to construct the turning pad at the entrance exit of the service station to minimize the Shires long-term maintenance costs at no stage during any of the meetings or exchanges over 15 months was the reconstruction of golf-links road to the extent reflected in point nine ever raised or mentioned by the Director of Planning senior management or staff at no stage I 'm sure counselors will understand this surprise has caused a significant amount of stress and unbudgeted further investment in addition to the holding costs already incurred on the property over many years we also explained where a small local family lok locally owned family company which is predominantly financed by the directors superannuation funds and was not in the business of building shire roads and infrastructure under duress or threat the Shire officials then suggested a compromise and offered to pay 50 percent towards the cost of building the road and infrastructure when asked what the costs of reconstruction would be the planning staff could back and advise six months of sense passed and my company has not received any further information in respect to the costs which is virtually foresters to bring the issue forward and get it over and done with by applying for this amendment we 've been pushed into it we suggested to the planning staff that the earth Gippsland child assign the design construction of the road and the infrastructure to their specifications and when the costs are known my company would consider contributing financially to the cost it was explained to the planning staff that it was totally unreasonable to expect company to make a financial commitment where costs are unknown and provide an open checkbook the latter is effectively what the planning staff are asking my company to do we were shocked to learn the planning staff put our planning permit application to Council indicating that my company had agreed to reconstruct Earthlings road to the levels reflected in point 9 at my company 's cost this is incorrect and my company did not agree to such a condition and in the normal course of reasonable business surely of money anywhere between two hundred three hundred I 've got no idea thousand dollars one would expect that there be some formal agreement and formal exchange in writing and there be a signature somewhere well I can tell you if someone can produce that document all on earth the planning department by its excellent actions has denied my company the opportunity to reassess the viability of the project before the planning permit was submitted to Council in other words if this was a requirement we would have had the opportunity to sit down redo our sums have a look at the project check out its viability and then make a decision and we could have made an informed decision as to whether the project could carry the extra costs and if these added costs rendered the project under unviable we would not have proceeded by spending all the money in the preparation of the with drilling architects drawings etc etc we 've spent up to pretty close to a hundred thousand dollars we wouldn 't have spent that money if we had have known what the rules would be transparent or informative about their actions to include the too contentious conditions in point nine my company being unaware of point nine proceeded and with the project in good faith and has expended many thousands of dollars on planning permits amendment planning fees town planning consultants and it goes on infinity my company has then tried to find a solution to the stalemate and ask the East Gippsland Shire planning staff to arrange a second meeting with senior officials which they facilitated and we 're all grateful for that right in attendance was the mayor Director of Planning and the Director of Operations the company 's town planner and myself at this meeting and was pointed out by my company we only became aware of the conditions contained in point nine when we received our copy of the official council minutes and approved planning permanently the Director of Planning displayed annoyance and made the following statement that he had mandated to the planning staff there were to be no surprises in approved planning permits for applicants he made that statement then then it follows on the director then turned and suggested that they need to go away discuss the matter and etc since the meeting my company has not been advised will receive any correspondence relating to the outcome of the mayor and the two directors private meetings or whether that took place I 've got no idea clearly planning staff have failed these ifs Ranchos own mission statement quote our vision our mission our values for the record in the our values that it reads accountability inclusion integrity respect resourcefulness there 's two key words that are missing out of the mission statement it is noted with interest transparency and honesty are not included in the our value statement you know I 'm not sure what you 're alluding to they don 't know let me finish what if I 'm right you came out of it all I 'll ask you not to to address us and if you 're going to be disrespectful I will stop you thank you I appreciate that and it 's not personal it 's a fact and what I 'm doing is reporting and are taking peccable notes is reporting exactly what mission statements of the earth gives lanch oh that 's odd quote I 've not made any earlier you did make some comments about integrity and stuff okay my company is not very invited to give the opportunity well we 've not been invited oh I 'm sorry I 've jumped ahead I wish to be very firm and clear my company did not agree to point nine dot points one and three before the application was presented to councillors for approval my company totally rejects any suggestion or claim it had agreed to these two contentious conditions my company did not was has not been invited or given the opportunity to the best to participate in an independent mediation session to try and resolve the matter however we are quite prepared to do so with welcomed it it is disappointing at no stage during the planning application procedure that any recognition has been given to the company in respect to the economic value and benefits the project offers for the Lakes Entrance community I 'm sure that councillors on Stan we can and we would want to contest the will cause a further process of delay plus additional cost to both council and our company as the proponent oh I 'm hoping therefore the common sense might might prevail here and the councilors will accept that the further costs extra demand placed on my company for the road and the infrastructure construction charge is untenable and inequitable moreover that such a charge was never raised in all our contact with the Shire and its planning department I do sincerely thank you for the opportunity to say my piece it 's been a long drawn-out process we want to get on with the project if any councillors have gone past the site of recent date you 'll see we 're expending a lot of money we 've got equipment there and we 've let the contracts for the residential subdivision at the top where we intend to build six very high-class highways so where we 're showing our confidence in faith and we 'd like council to consider what I 've said and and our amendment application please thank you thank you mister any questions well mr. Hardy 's here provided on the initial planning documents the planning application that he was to his sorry is a truth that it was not included on the original planning document for the the condition of the roads etc to be included councillor the we had some preliminary meetings with mr. gazzarri before the application was launched he wished to know what type of conditions if it was ever to be approved would be likely to be on the permit I can 't recollect young entertain mr. Kaiser DS word for it but I 'd be very surprised if we didn 't say infrastructure upgrades but I 'll takings tags IDs were not councils you are called at this application was subject of a planning consultation meeting where issues such as pedestrian safety road traffic management was heavily raised by numerous objectors I also take exception to the requirement for council offices as a as a proposal is muted having to be able to tell an applicant every single conditional come on planning permit that 's not our role it 's something that occurs through the process and it depends what the process and obtain expert advice in this case the advice on the roads drainage etc comes from our internal engineers there are also other issues that must be considered and that is Venice raised in objections we know that any of the objections there was lots of concerns raised by local life landowners about the safety of children going to some brennan 's church there was a lot of discussion about children having to use the road and there was a lot of discussion about the fact that this development was going to be a node it was going to be an attractor of traffic and volumes of what is currently a residential standard street with a residential standard street only expected to get minor traffic flows it 's deterioration would it be for some time we 've allowed for a proposal we would expect that any developers upon their due diligence would realize that a road like that may need to have been reviewed and be considered for reconstruction and I would have thought mr. gazzarri would have got some own advice on that and indeed council officers realizing that party with mr. gizoni in cement even said we will pay for 50% of that road reconstruction and the footpath construction to say that we weren 't transparent we went through a planning consult a ssin meeting we went through full advertising with the community we then produce minutes of a planning consultative meeting we then produced a council report which is available for review on the Friday before the council meeting we had a open Council many to determine the application with all the conditions listed in that particular report I think councils been very transparent and we 've followed all procedures and policy I know that 's long a so now their long night sorry if I went too long cancer Alice you had a question I do for the director governance I 've got a question for you now that 's right long day it 's councils process to make public and the gender councils agenda for public information can so can you just outline for mr. gazzarri when we would make that forthcoming agenda available for public access and where could the public access our agenda the web at 00 p.m. on Friday and is available from councils general website thank you as a matter of course in a report from an officer and it 's a in such as tonight 's agenda would the recommendations of the offices be published in that particular document oh and web page just correct the the officer who 's responsible it 's 00 p.m. not 4 p.m. and the answer to that question is yes the officers recommendation is always published in the agenda oops this appointing a longbow mister hello but can you call whether or not recommendation nine was published in that agenda on that particular day yes it was a two-year it could I did have a question I 'm not sure who to address it to mr. Ghazali referred to a six-month delay in asking for some sort of costing on the road and correct me if I 'm wrong up until this point you 've not had a reply to that request can I ask if that 's the case and if so why if I recall correctly we discussed sharing the design cost would do their own due diligence and get an estimate of costs it doesn 't require final design and so you know engineering consultancy will provide an indicative rate for that sort of road upgrade council agreed to share the cost of that design mr. gizoni showed no interest at any time in contributing to that the design cost nor is he ever committed to any substantial contribution to road up3 he had a follow-up question counsel to Chris so would it not be fair for us to give even a budget estimate or some form of advice as to what that what that cost might be he fairly unusual for a council to provide engineering advice and provide costumes for a project that is a development project it 's it 's not something we would normally enter into it so if that were the case why was that position not conveyed to mr. gizoni position was always clear that we would share costs for the design life as we said we would share costs for the construction of the road sorry my point being that mr. gazzarri 's at all in this in regards to this so if if we 're not in the business of doing that which I accept that to be the case that perhaps that should have been conveyed to mr. de Zarate not nothing hey if I if I may clarify as well mr. mr. gazzarri lodged a planning permit application to remove the the entire requirement to build the road and build the footpath you know a matter of a couple of months after that meeting that he had with us and therefore we had you know we we basically were in a position to price across the road or or give him those costs because he was seeking to remove the condition entirely question as well it said the initial planning one of the initial conditions was that the proponent was to cover the full cost of the the road and the footpaths at what point did counsel the offices opinion change to half the cost or cope contribute counselor there was the permit issued and mr. gizoni had contacted counsel wish to have some discussions and it was at that point through the matters that mr. gizoni didn 't agree with and it was at that time that the directors thought that a cost-sharing arrangement would be sensible given the fact that and he 's also going to be a council Road with local traffic care else like I 've got three quick questions one is just the clarification of the road or we 're talking about and I take it that from my recollection of this particular application and it was only between the princess highway and see like clothes am I correct in that the in a matter of couple hundred meters thank you the second point is but it 's concern me the I can recall the the ninth condition and we 're thinking about the condition of that road being quite familiar with that area and thinking that was a reasonable application and reading about it of course in the briefing session and it was it was an obvious matter but I and I took it as the decision of counsel that mr. Quezada is the applicant would meet his obligation and met and and make this get the right to make a decision to enter into a bartering situation with mr. Gilardi when it 's a council decision that he should have paid for the whole the whole kit and caboodle I 'm interested to understand that where does that come from then demo I think it 's uncommon at all to negotiate conditions that occur on the original permit there are often requests for amendments to permits that was a decision based on what we thought it was what we thought it officer level was fairness between counsel and the developer I can 't throw us had a couple of questions Thank You Sonia the there are statements being made and there 's an answer to each of those statements if I if I could please the the the best available time is 4 p.m. on the Friday night the council meetings on the following Tuesday to my understanding and and information and advice that I saw that once it 's on the agenda well first of all we didn 't pick it up because that particular weekend I was away but but I don _''_6098.71 's a facility to be able to object if it 's already on the agenda so I 'm confused about that one the next one is when we 're going to provide 50% of the cost 50% of what we 've got absolutely no idea are we committing ourselves to spend 200,000 or or 2 yeah we don 't know we I 'm sorry but in the commercial world we don 't do business like that and in respect to the we 've already constructed at great cost under a separate planning permit the road from from the highway at more than at least 200 meters which only takes it halfway down golf-links Road not golf-links Road is about 450 meters long but we 've already constructed heart with curbing the only thing missing is on the north side of the road which wasn 't a part of our a rigid condition we haven 't_''_6174.61 constructed the footpath now we 've offered to do whatever VicRoads wants for safety on the intersection of princess Highway and golf-links Road we 've offered to complete the the all the curbing and infrastructure turning pad in so the shire doesn 't incur ongoing maintenance with traffic coming in and out of one spot and an important point is it 's during the planning stage it was advised to us and suggested to us that we put left-hand turns in no right-hand turn reins no no right-hand turn turn signs to direct the traffic back onto the princes highway that that was told to us and like and the other right and when you read the condition 9 in closely it 's just so open I 'm sorry we don 't I can 't go into and do business with just this open openness it 's it should be more defined and maybe maybe maybe the Planning Department will pick that up for any future business that they 're doing with people where you know you you should get people committed to do something mr. mayor sounds like we 're in debate at the moment enough you know he was giving a presentation and I think we 've heard the matter certainly weren 't burning debate Thanks okay so counselors there 's a recommendation to amend the permit I just want to reiterate that the permit as it was issued stands this is just this proposed amendments to condition nine of efemer thank you I 'm having any further questions can 't suppose just curious about the length of the expected section of Golf Links Road that the applicant is expected to propose to to actually upgrade wondering whether he was studying that that work has already been done because to me it only appears to be like a hundred meters maybe it 's 200 meters I 'm not really sure and I have a follow-on question after this as mr. gazzarri said he thinks it 's about four hundred and fifty meters there 's always a requirement to I 'll be they construct out the front of his property that 's that 's something that you 're always required to do I can actually recall as can director Holt and I believe that we raised the issue about vehicles and might be screwing out of that and into the the road and that we suggest is they look at some concrete padding there road so I 'm in agreeance with you Council I believe it 's as extensive as 450 metres when you take out his development side as well question is why was he asked or requested to to build or build it all the way through to see link is it ceiling road selling clothes yes so councilors the reason why that decision was made was that it was clear to planning officers and the engineers that the whole of golf-links Road from Parma 's Road through to this site would be utilized by in particular localized traffic this is a proposal for a service petrol station and two convenience restaurants we know that a lot of the traffic will be coming from the West the western side of lakes entrance and a conservative view that I had a look at this afternoon 60% of town would live on the western side of this site and they would use clearly golf-links Road rather than going the long route around the highway counselor Ellis had a vacation from gazali said did did I take it that he was responsible for the construction like close in another previous application mr. Quezada say no castle Buckley ya mean that 's you you said he 's a permit still stands can he go ahead and do what he wants to do without this work he said he said these permit still stands koneko is as far as he intends to without us without having to deal with these issues counselor no I want to be very low and trying to be as clear as I can the planning permit that was issued by counsel stands if you made a decision tonight to review the refused the application to I 'm in the permit councils make a decision not to amend condition 9 so mr. Zaidi would be bound by condition 9 as per the permit that was issued by counsel counsel pills question where has the option of counsel funding some of the road or part of the road or all the rest of the road where has that gone in this Agreement or doesn 't it stand anymore counselor say just to support and agree with director Halton that there was negotiations that we completely broke down an application to amend the permit to delete the conditions was put forward so obviously all negotiations had ceased if we were of a mind to continue to negotiate with the 50 percent contribution then we would also be Overmind to continue with requesting society to provide us with 50 percent of the design and the investigative dollars required so further questions counselor I 'm happy to move the motion mr. mee it 's been moved by Councillor Eve so we have a seconder for the motion counselor Ellis speakers yeah just quickly I think though if this has been spoken at length I 'd normally entire road construction cost of infrastructure procurement benchmark document that mr. Gilardi might be able to reference and get an understanding of potential costs that would be good business practice so any further speakers counselor else just simply to say that I think the offices for their their frankness and openness been responding to the questions of mr. gazzarri and of councillors in relation to this matter the situation is that mr. Gilardi has had lost nothing with this application and and as a counsel for the Greater East Gippsland Shire so for him to renegotiate his position with council officers for the benefit of our country frf community and for the benefit of his company Thank You mr. mee thank you cancer Ellis any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that item five point three point one is regional and district events sponsorship raids round two 2017-18 assessment [Applause] thanks despair council says you 're aware council runs a raise grant program twice a year this the current round received 15 applications totaling 50 which was the purpose of rides mr. site support enhancement of events throughout the show and the program obviously stimulates economic activity within the towns that the events operating over the last 12 months groups a screaming the increase in visitors from Victoria in the state and international as well attending a lot of the events that that we have supported through the right to program the panel recommendations contained within the report indicate that there 's a number of other occasions over the next five financial years the reason are actually for two or three years so that 's that 's where that comes from the recommendation is contained within the report and I 'm quite happy to to answer any questions thanks mr. Morton any questions councillors council white and with the amounts that you allocate here I did have a phone call from one of the applicants recently to see you know if I were in on the list these figures what they 'd asked for or are they a proportion of you know like how do you broken it down like you did most most of the people that have applied if they asked for five thousand with that bottom 5,000 thanks for cushion the majority the ones that are located there yes that would be the cars this just referred to the attachment or appendix which which details the request of funding and the and the amount that is recommended and so some of them yes were were provided with the exact amount that they applied for and others were was reduced I I don 't think any more than my answer is any further the cross marathon expenditure and how often we seem to be part of that the roads funding is obviously to attract and support events that the excuse name for the last number of years has grown significantly and there is a an associated costs us both in attracting those events and that 's where this comes down to so there are other events that that have a community benefit that are under the Community Grants Scheme which is in the report but this one is around of an attraction and supporting events can you just clarify the amount in all that we 're actually yeah cancer Alice I do hello Joyce it 's asking some questions on this issue I didn 't intend to but I 'm looking at that company IJ events in once we provide the grants and this is probably something I dunno then I 'm going to ask this question none of these companies record to a provider and acquittal of the monies provided to them back to Council so we know that their monies have been spent and that debts incurred by their company in that they 're all met yes I certainly do so each organization that employs our funding in successful enters into an agreement with Council and I certainly have to avoid an acquittal what the polarization of any other questions just add that determined on the basis of whether they have met their commitments to provide those acquittals so we would not be recommending funding for organizations that have failed to meet that obligation thanks mister no further questions is the recommendation before it 's councillors move counselor Ellis seconded counsel what any further speakers I 'll put that all those in favor against its carry thank you IOM that five point four point one order at Risk Committee Charter Review and we did have circulated Koya welcome Thank You mr. mayor the report before you seeks council review on adoption of the draft revised audit and Risk Committee Charter as listed with always had amendment the committee 's current terms of references reached the end of its to you review period a couple of weeks this council offices under two the process of including the amendments to the local government in advance of the required time ones apart from any administrative changes that were identified as specific changes that have been included within the new charter are a change to the name of the committee which will now be referred to as the audit and Risk Committee and the terms of reference now being referred to as the audit committee charter there 's also an increase in the monitoring against the requirements of the local government bill minimum requirements relating to the composition and skills base of the audit committee and its members the requirement of the committee to review the risk registers of council to help guide the annual audit work program the mandatory requirement for those on the committee to also participate in the annual performance review process the audit committee was actually presented with this particular draft at their April meeting where they noted the changes that were made and we 're comfortable with what was proposed so they 're out I 'm happy to field any questions on that otherwise I 'd like to propose that the council endorsed the recommendation is provided within the report polls second to council Rives any speakers questions all those in favor cants carry thank you item five point four point two proposed lease of land to copper Kim limited to give those Street benamber mr. Mara I 'd like to request that we defer this item we defer the item on grounds that we 've received letters from the public after the section two to three hearing held on 24th of the 4th questioning where the proper due process was followed one of the submitters has alleged that were they would not give him the proper right to be heard as per the Local Government Act there have been allegations of misconduct and to ensure that we have followed the correct section two to three process or request that we do further matter until it 's been followed up accordingly their second or third counselor what is this emotion defer defer the item council roberts has moved to defer the item and it 's seconded by Councillor white did you want to speak to deferment counselor yeah I also received several submissions remembers the public just recap regarding the got a motion for us to defer this item good question you could have a question yes in two it says a right to the two submitters what does that mean what did people say people that have objected or oh well that 's the to submitters we 're talking that counsel tells question I 'm just a query as to where the does my question is does councilor Roberts have a conflict of interest putting this to the table given the fact the two submitters were related to him something he 's got to determine himself I 'm happy to take advice but I 'm not gonna declare a conflict of interest yeah further questions I 'm just concerned that we 're unable I 'm not able to make any sort of decision because I don 't fully understand but the reason for the difference again they 're not like oh well I 'd like to ask Council Roth 's to speak to the matter so we can understand the actual reasons why we should defer what seems to me on the answer to a straightforward least decision it don 't want to enter into debate the the question was raised not specifically to the tules but to the section two to three hearing process the the submitter who was speaking to the the proposal felt that they had not been given the proper position to speak before this council as per the act as the chairman of that two to three hearing there was some heated discussion and I had responded to the person in relation to the issue raised then in that letter I am confirmed that I don 't believe that further two to three hearing is required this this motion is not requesting that there 's an additional two to three I 'm just requesting that we yeah disposes audible sorry direction cancels okay what clearly this is getting to a stage toward some of some concern there this is the letter that was distributed to counselors yes it includes a complaint against councillor Reeves and so the obvious question that I have to ask in making this decision is are not seeking governance advice here is should should we be discussing this matter because the letters my to bike without my understanding complaints against councillors are a metaphor the mayor assisted with the CEO my understanding to the mayor here is the mayor has responded on that issue as well it was a letter emailed and a hard copy mailed so just to clarify that both aspects of the letter which was that I a fair section two to three submission wasn 't held and to that a council race was alleged to have engaged in inappropriate conduct have been addressed then responded to by venir yeah look I think that 's an obvious question come on I 'm trying not to dig well I 'm just trying to so what are we doing gaining from the differing this yeah what will we gain in the event that it on in hindsight is always 20 and if we look back and we find that maybe we were not in not in performing us the two to three and requirements of the Act if it was found that we weren 't following proper process then I believe there would be a greater consequence of councilor submitters weren 't submitting in the spirit and the letter of a two to three either so I don 't believe we should defer this matter so I 'll put the motion to defer then did you have a question before I put it yes thank you would deferring this affect our arrangements with the mine in any way in delaying their their program you know could I ask that well the question is would defer in this decision affect a mine in any way in in slowing down their program and that question perhaps is still no no they 're still seeking their approvals for them on they don 't have any hurry to occupy the song well if there is something awkward here if that 's the case if it 's not going to affect the mine its flowing again in anyway I think we should look at it a little bit more closely Thank You detective three was held in accordance with two to three regulations there was nothing wrong with the duty-free meeting but taking that on for them to say that 's good so mr. is no further action yes we haven 't_''_7630.08 we haven 't been privy to that letter so mr. mayor I move the motion be put okay the motion is to defer this item all those in favor all those against motion is lost item five point four point two proposed lease of land to copper can be limited to give a story for number we have the recommendation moved councillor O 'Connell seconded councillor Reeves speakers look I won 't take up too much more time but I mean this this place is a great outcome for all involved the community gains and updated building and it 's no cost to the rate payer at all so fully supported and recommend it you all do too so yeah if you like to any further speakers against speakers fall no further speakers I 'm going to put the motion all those in favor against its Thanks for we tackle items seven we have a couple of speakers mr. CL blue yes we have mr. Squires first who wants to speak to this tree take the streetscape upgrade stage two which is come forward for another cup of coffee so he is fine mr. mayor and councillors thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight first off I just want to make it clear that I 'm not speaking for any particular group in all bust and my individual submission however having said that I am active in quite a lot of compare community I think I have a clear understanding of what the community is thinking on a lot of issues the streetscape Stage one was completed last year and has been to most people in the community anyway a roaring success during 2016 there was extensive consultation prior to that process run by the Shire and the consultants at the sharp end employed that consultation included the formation of a community reference group which was made up from members of all boss community including all Bosch regional health muji Aboriginal co-op Police Chamber of Commerce senior citizens Neighborhood House and Youth Ambassador they were also there was also a consultation breakfast with Nicholson Street traders who were those most going to be most impacted by the streetscape on a daily community members could talk to the consultants and shy reps about their issues and there are opportunities to comment online all those processes identified a number of key issues and and and there was a real emphasis on the uneven and often slippery pavements which were made worse by wet or dried leaves and the acorns from the oak trees there was recognition of an aging population and a significant number of trips and in Falls and then actually break the broken arms and wrists as a result of some of the hazards that were in the street as it was at that stage there was also a recognition that parts of the street had cross slopes on them that were not in line with current standards a major issue was the fact that the large oak trees and in the street were causing damage to infrastructure pulling up the pavers and in fact worse they were putting structural damage to some premises in fact I spoke with one business owner who has had the Shah dig up the path in front of his premises three times to try and also during the process it was identified that they were need for additional crossing points in our Nicholson Street which is quite a wide Street as most of you would know so those initial consultation process has occurred the consultants went away with your your staff and came back for a second round of consultation where they had incorporated all of those they 've incorporated a number of the things that have been taken on board that have been raised by the various people for instance there were I think it 's three two locations where people will be able to cross with a small safety as with all consultation not everyone was happy with the final outcome and that 's the nature of consultation obviously everyone doesn 't get their way however most people accepted the compromise situation the contract was let in early 2017 and the work started in April the work proceeded extremely well the traders were impressed by the cooperation that they got from the the contractor and most in the community very pleased with the outcome which we now have on the west side of were some in the community who aren 't happy with the trees that the had been selected for the streetscape and after some negotiation was put around town they actually came to this table and as a result of that council on the 5th of September 17 moved to motion to alter the trees that would be going in Nicholson Street and that move was to go away a little bit from add evergreen trees which and and two more he deciduous trees it should be noted that some people thought that the streets should have some greenery all year and some evergreen trees in the main street in the winter we 're a good idea compared with stark deciduous trees which have nothing at this time of year it 's important to note that in the preamble to the motion that was approved at your September meeting council else I think it was noted and I quote support for this project has been evidenced by Sony of what was intended to be a petition to cancel by 375 or Vash residents the nature of the document indicates that no currently being undertaken by council they consider the choice of tree inappropriate and the council is not acting in the best interest of their town so those words are very important the residents were happy with the streetscape but it was just the trees the selection of trees of concern at that stage so be fair to assume that after that the community understood that stage 2 what happened in 2018 and it would be a mirror image of stage 1 as per the plans original plans that had been presented to the community and had been through a number of community consultation processes recent articles in the snow of a male would indicate to me that there are still some people that haven 't accepted the umpires decision that there will be a streetscape with which will be a new streetscape which means that the old oak trees have to go they have good reasons as I said before for those trees trees going and they haven 't changed it seems to me that we should be way past that and we should accept that the streetscape that we to be duplicated on the east side of Mickelson Street I understand council has put out four tenders on that process and may in fact be considering those that after this meeting I 'm not sure whether it would be technically possible to retain those old oak trees because when I look at them they 're all at different heights and I know from what the consultants told us that there 's got to be some benching of those of those footpaths to get all the right levels and so on but even if it were technically possible to retain them it doesn 't overcome that one of the major issues with this streetscape which was to address the safety concerns which was to address the damage caused by the roots of these very large trees the damage caused to infrastructure the damage caused to in fact premises owned by businesses in the Main Street so it seems to me that if you have consultation you go through a process of getting consider consensus or at least people agreeing that they there 's a compromised situation being developed then the and it seems to be happening again now it 's not a good way to do business once once there is a agreement on a process we should proceed and I urge that counsel and I 'm sure I talked for a lot of people in all of us get on with the streetscape on these side of Nicholson street to the and and get on to the the planes that were developed after the extensive community consultation and let 's duplicate what 's on the west side on the east side of Nicholson Street and have it ready by Christmas this year thank you thanks we now have windy Nixon council mayor of like centrosome I just like to say first I 've never done this before I 'm just relaxing you will realize that I did endeavor to our group to present the councillors with this copy of that to firstly I head up the what 's known as the beautification team for almost and we 've been working in the last ten years and I think we 've done some very successful projects and of course even lot of interest and we designed the the town beautification plan around Nicholson Street which had a feature of oak trees and these are the oak trees that we 've been talking about on paint on item one of the photos of the trees you 'll have a look these are the the trees that are causing a lot of chitchat around the town these Oaks were planted in 1984 so they 're around 30 odd years old and from what I can gather from people that know their trees they are basically in their prime and they very long-lived and when you look at those photos they are absolutely beautiful for 11 months of the year and in 1 month of the year they drop their leaves so everybody is saying oh you can 't have leaves in the main street you slip and you do this and you do that I just like to point out to everybody and remind everybody that leaves are part of our part of life from they 're part of every town Europe Canada the Americas South America or Boston and Ben stone don 't see people complaining about those Street has beautiful trees we don 't hear people complaining about that they say they 're an asset rather than a liability these trees Michael Meccan who has been through Burnley and he has a develop the primer of horticulture he says they 're in perfect health admittedly on the side that 's just been completed the word trees that have been hacked around by the old SEC some were not in very good health the worse some near the National Bank that we were told by the track consultants that they were going to be kept and at six o 'clock one morning I went down the street and they had been filled and they were perfectly healthy trees so what we are suggesting to to counsel is that some of these trees could be retained and let 's appreciate the atmosphere that they give to or post Main Street which according to these photos here it 's very evident the western side of the street that 's been completed on on page two there isn 't there isn 't any shade species that have been planted originally there and under power lines and there hasn 't been room for big trees but that photo clearly shows how bear how uninviting it is we can 't_''_8630.46 say that one side should be a mirror image of the other because there 's different widths there 's different heights in all the shops some of you go in on on a level some of you go up three steps so how can the pavements accommodate all of those shops when when or boss when the shire or gosh tire at that stage plant of these trees the young the chitchat round the town was all they 'll cover up them the ugly shops and if you have a look on item three you 'll see what I mean by ugly shocks that become very evident and if if the trees on north of Worsley Street are removed all you see now is a couple of businesses and the rest of the shops are empty so if these trees on item four every time they will help help cover up the empty shops and if and you if you 're approached from the northern side and you drove into town and it 's bare and empty shops I think you would think twice about investing in almost and this this one the final on page five I mean what could be more beautiful than that we we don 't see that brutha is a busy little town now because that has lovely trees in the street I don 't see anybody wanting to cut them down in bends though so our group especially and myself personally appealing to the councillors to think again and you know the old saying goes when when in doubt say no because those trees are very very valuable to the ascetics of almost the shade just let me read this for me track consultants who were the consultants and Fiona was there I set out and Fiona will realize that I sat there with them and listen to what people said and in their analysis and the feedback on page 30 the general and I 'm quoting the general consensus was not wanting to modern I was the looking street excessive aesthetic character of the landscape and they also said on that was on page 13 on page 16 they state and I quote that some of the priests should be retained where possible now if you sell if you fell in all these trees and they 've been all felt on the other side the counselor has not taken into account the recommendation of the tech consultants which no doubt cost a lot of money for their advice you just imagine Canberra without trees you think what what can was trees and fun for Canberra on a dryer lint interesting landscape and you go into Canberra in the summer and it 's absolutely beautiful in the last the last summer when when we would drive into the street during the last summer holidays you could it was very evident that people were wanting to find the shade and all the cars were parked up in the shade there were people sitting out under the shade and and if those trees are gone where would they go they they would think well this is hot and hot and nasty will weeks Gary did refer to the articles in the paper we will prompt them to have a meeting put this submission to the council try and get some articles in the paper so the people would become aware of just what is going to happen and on page two two there if you see that photo sorry that one in particular which you 've all got it 's fair it 's uninteresting there isn 't any shade and it doesn 't believe it doesn 't give any aesthetic appeal at all I think during the past two weeks the number of people that have phoned me up and said what can we do I have said write to the council and I think I don 't know how many submissions that has been but I do know there has been quite a lot and I just don 't think the public realize and that those trees are going to go as far as that the pavement go we 're suggesting to you that the pavement on that side of the street be left exactly the same level as it is certainly the we we realize that them you know the professor 's ups and downs everywhere all that has to be fixed and if the leaves are a problem they could have a a non-slip surface anywhere wherever you go what city around the world Melbourne all the way up the coast you see non-slip surfaces on pavements and I think that 's a very relevant point here we go when do you really really sorry nearly through I you nearly through your presentation yeah I can 't I can 't I can 't accept that one side should be a mirror the other because they they 're all different the rebels are different and the trees can be balanced up so that it doesn 't look doesn 't look out of place so it would certainly save a lot of money and if you 're going to award a contract tonight how can you award a contract when we don 't know what 's going in there we haven 't been told we have asked and asked and asked to have an on display in all bust which we the council said that they will come back to the community is the plans that hasn 't happened and I would urge the council to do just that and just take a little bit of time to make sure that everybody is aware of what is going to happen I think it 's a you know what you 're doing we really commend the council for wanting to upgrade and make things safe and that can be done by doing very simple things by leaving the levels exactly as they are and having a non-slip surface pick out the trees that are nice shape when we 're there up over the the verandas in some cases they can be pruned selectively pruned and a lot of people chose me oh I wish that the council would be a bit more spot on with their maintenance the leaves get blown once a week they 're blown injured the gutter and a gust of wind comes and they blow them back but if if the council spent money on that one month and had all the the aesthetic value of our town at the moment with without industry allotments prospect opening industry and we really do need something that 's going to last us for lots of years so we do need to be very very careful on what we do thank you eastern side on the eastern side on the side that you 're talking about that 's the eastern side Thanks funny okay we need to go into confidential business to discuss a confidential contractual matter yes yes please yes I move that we moved to in camera I guess I 'm reading this line in respect to section 89 Local Government Act that stipulates is that supposed to be reading so thank you the Kansas Council a special committee may resolve that making be closed the members of the public if the meeting is discussing any of the following pay personal matters be personal hardship any resident or ratepayers see industrial matters the contractual matters he proposed developments if a legal advice G matters thanking security of counsel H any other matters with counsel of the special committee consumers would be prejudiced the council or any person and I the public that 's different to what I remember reading but anyway I so I so move that there is a short version contact lens are a bit sticky today so it was definitely the longer all those all those in favor so we 're going to camera that 's what I base against Skerritt yes _"

    "text": "in relation to the matter and then proceeded to debate the matter at a later time so these are matters of interest to not only myself but to the wider public circuits rellis what question do you would you like to ask I think there 's a number of questions that need to be generally asked the first I 'll deal with is that with a couple straightforward simple questions one is in relation to the applications of the differential rates and my first question will be in two proportions of the vote the rating capacity and that is noting the current financial and environmental conditions of our client here in the skips land and the difficulty they are farmers are facing can you advise is it correct that I 've read that the farmers have been four of our 56 million dollars in total of rape revenue that the farmers fortunately are only paying four point five million of those total rate of income which are to my the calculation accounts to aviod 8% of the writable income set is that a correct interpretation um is counselor Ellis the rage income for these 1819 year of the 39.8 over for general rates that excludes the reducible charge that would apply to any of farming properties but adjust the rate in the dollar yes thank you I have a series of other question yes with your indulgence it that 's good I know a local citizen mr. writers in in in the chamber this evening and he has an issue which I 'd like to draw the attention to miss Bennett in relation to the application of differential rates mr. Roe circulated and ended a letter to each of the counselors at this table of the ceiling in relation to his concerns into the matter I 'm wondering if you could provide me with some response as to the contents of his of his concern and later Thank You mr. Roth had two issues in his letter one was in relation to what is required before a property can be treated as a single rating enterprise and I 'm happy to advise that we 've corresponded offline with mr. Roth about that and have well essentially achieved the outcome he other issue is one about not so much different well differential rating but how counselors determine what a property is classified as in terms of farm rage general or commercial industrial and weather officers are applying the correct methodology when looking at dual occupancy properties it 's the view of officers that we 've responded to mr. Roth on this issue over a number of years and we had hope that we put it to bed however that 's clearly not the case and I 'd like to make it known to mr. Roth but if he would like to come in and meet with us again I 'm very happy to sit down with him and walk him through our of his concerns I 'm not prepared to stand back and let our ears all tile questions but I do have some others first thank you any other consul Roberts Thank You mr. mayor mr. Collins if the proposed rate increase of 2.25 percent was not imposed what would be the remaining deficit on the BOE story of surplus on the budget so if we reduced the the 2.25 thousand dollars that we would have to either come off the bottom line of the surplus but this in effect 900,000 which either ends up not in the bank at the end of the year or not allocated to services and we would have to review and obviously that 's a significant range to the budget which is obviously another consideration for council yes so further questions back to you cancer Ellis sorry counts counselor else you had your follow-up question I do think that there are you know this is a particularly important document and then rushing it through doesn 't achieve too much you know in a mad rush we need to take your time think about what 's happening every year I draw attention to the issue of the 5% pension a discount and this year mr. Collins I ask again that is that an app or an appropriate amount of discount to assist people who are doing it particularly hard in our community this year the amount of discount offered to pensioners is 57 and at a 5% discount right on the average average writeable income than that 5% figure can you tell me what action officers can take to address that weakness Thank You counselor Ellis the the application of a fixed amount in terms of the additional rebate for eligible pensioners was discussed through the rating strategy when the rating strategy came before council so in terms of what that is that 's totally council 's decision not the officers to see the officers will just put the information forward for councilors then to decide in terms of the whole rating strategy from differential rating waste right through to any other rebates that they may wish to apply so that 's what 's in the budget here is a direct result of the adopted rating strategy of council this year rather than the offices matter of community well-being I note in your briefing sheet and the project highlights under the heading footpaths and cycleways included shows including the omiyo mountain bike trail stage 11.5 million now the total proposed budget for there is only two point one four one four nine million so two million two hundred thousand miss cons is that an appropriate kilometers where the footpaths in the shower of the skips land and with the presentations I have made to me we need to allocate all their monies to that so what 's that only a bike trail which I understand is the mountain bike time is that the appropriate section to have that particular run commercial venture in Thank You counselor Ellis in terms of the capital works program I 'll need to pass across to mr. weights whose area manages the capital works programs and the classification and allocation of those works Cancellara get to be fairly logical classification decision under its recreational path of some form your comment about whether we should be allocating that one one five million dollars to footpaths historically council has spent in the order of I think around the 100 to 150 thousand a year on the footpath works would be a huge change to our historic way of dealing with footpaths whether the course that 's the council decision at the end of the day but obviously we held councilor workshops regarding the capital programs so that issues have been raised on news mr. weights but I think of us to take a straw poll I don 't think too many councils remembered that the funding for this particular project which is still aspirational was to be taken from the footpath construction or repaired budget I don 't recall that at all personally and I take a particular interest in these sorts of things so I 'm pleased you 'd be mused I think that I don 't ask you for a reply did you have a further question canceled it 's not like you to fold the pressure up counselor Ellis was there any other questions we have an amendment that we have to deal with speaker the amendment would you like to sleep Thank You mr. mayor um it 's been raised about the the amount that farmers paying right some this this amendment is not about farmers it 's about the entire Shire there is extreme financial difficulty within the broader part of the shire and I also include self retirees shop owners with no tenants and low income earners who don 't receive much of a pay rise and you know just puts more pressure now it was a little bit disturbing to me before that I was chastised or staff a late notice on this issue I did remind them because they said the budget had been brought had been spoken about earlier I did remind them that I was on leave of absence then I was told that I could have emailed my trip to the Kimberley 's did not include even phone coverage so and unfortunately I 've been unwell since that trip so I thought I was doing the appropriate thing I spoke earlier today to councillors about my thoughts on this issue I also think that I 've seen some some errors of judgment with expenditure in the last six or eight months which would more than cover if those errors were not made would more than cover this right right reduction right sorry no increase to rights and I look at that because you know I 've been unfortunately in told that by putting this motion forward it make me look like a fool well so be a I 'm in the and the residents of this show and I would hope that my important could improve the way the show does its business in terms of correcting mistakes and losses of money now please miss Collins I have the greatest respect for your work because you actually get thrown all these nasty curveballs and you seem to come out the other end managing to balance the books and I think that 's a marvelous job because this you know these these these curve balls are costing the shower money internally but that 's the reason the I post I still think that it 's it 's something that would help the community I 've been told that this would if this went if this motion was was to get up that it would put the show behind by years and years well I do disagree because we are still a growing area you know like you know in a residential style in other words there are more and more ratepayers coming to this area so I 'm sure that the show will pick up more rates through the fact that we this area so I would just like other councillors to think think of what I 've said unfortunately we were backed into a corner an hour ago and and I a strawpoll which suggested this motion will be defeated but look you can look at me like this but I 'm just saying it as it is and as it has been that 's the way I do business so thank you ii Oh would you like to speak counselor oh it 's another feather feather dad mister man thank you sir any further speakers of counsel Buckley Thank You mr. mee and the most common complaint is that rates are too high last election the need to bring down rates was a key issue now people see us as rightful wasteful is not enough attention to compliance in big tenders and major works they say we spend too much on Melbourne lawyers and consultants too much on self-promotion and too much on interstate trips with staff as well as councillors going along rates have more than doubled in 10 years while many people in East Gippsland are struggling it are more and more empty shops as a council we should be working to bring rates down and not just year by year raising them as high as the government kept wolf community now I 'd like to emphasize the unfairness in in our rating system and work towards an improvement I 'll keep digging in mind that the municipal charges of tax well highest capital value a capital improved value that C IV in this municipality is 30 million six hundred and twenty seven thousand and the lowest capital improved valuation equals once one players and we 're paying the same the one with the 1,000 capital improve value he 's paying the same rate tax if you like because municipal charges of tax of two hundred and eighty nine dollars and seven since that 's an unfairness ratio of thirty thousand six hundred and twenty seven to one and so I think that this I know we 're working towards ten percent capital improved value but I don 't think that 's good enough and keeping in mind that only about half the Menace 's municipalities have it business what people do with their properties provided it 's within the law and we could avoid all these gray areas like little workshops ran in residential areas that really technically should be paying under our system a commercial rate but they 're paying a residential way and the other one is the course of the farm right but I 'm not going there right now so I am speaking in favor of the amendment and I put it to you that we should board to support it and then rework the Biggers a little bit Thank You fellow councils Thank You council Buckley councillor pearls are speaking against the amendment yes I 'd like to speak against the amendment there 's a player file just to assist you counsel but are you responding as or your rider reply or you know this is the amendment we 're dealing with the amendment counselor I asked you I 'd like to speak against the amendment I disagree with councilor white that he 's been only had the opportunity of the last month to be able to discuss the budget as it this year so we 've had four months discussing this and at no other stage has it come to the table about rate reductions zero rates even the municipal charge hasn 't even been discussed and whilst councillor Buckley actually brings it up every year at this time he doesn 't ever bring it up at our meetings when we 're actually talking about budget so to me I feel like this evening they 're actually trying to put in something quite difficult for council and our time frames that we actually have because we only have until the 30th of June to adopt a budget for this council for the next financial year if we don 't adopt the budget we have nothing to work with and we then have to go back out to the public with some new form of what these gentlemen are trying to propose a it 's delaying the process and B we start in six months time again on next year 's budget and I feel it would be more appropriate to be bringing these issues up so that we can deal with year 's budget which is why I 'm saying to you we we do need to proceed tonight with what we have on the table that we 've been working for four months with I think the the officers have made an excellent budget for us there 's plenty of things for all areas on the table we 've even got a million dollar savings in services that we 've been able to adhere to for the last three years so as it stands I 'm not prepared to support the amendment tonight Thank You councillor pals council what you have a right to reply on that unless there 's further speakers counselor Ellis you wish to speak for against aye I followed the sentiment of say speaking for against on I 'm speaking against mr. me like you follow the sentiment of the two previous speakers and understand their position but the situation is just have been explained to Council is that the complications in relation to the non passing of a budget the fact that the budget is in itself sound makes it very difficult not to prefer natural course we have plenty of opportunities counselor felt set to work to a budget into the future and we need to have some clear thought in relation to rate reductions and all that matter rate increases that said I cannot support the unmended to the motion before council this evening thanks counselor Ellis any further speakers I 'll ask Council what if you 'd like to write a reply I 'll put the amendment all all those in favor of the amendment have three in favor of the event those against the amendment that takes us back to the motion council pills Thank You mr. mayor as already stated the actual increase of the 2.25% when viewing it isn 't excessive when you look at the Bureau of Statistics CPI figures for 2018 it is 2.2 percent so it means our budget is 0.05 percent more than CPI which doesn 't actually buy your life in the big frame of things with the amount of services over a hundred services that council actually delivers I think with regards to what needs to be achieved and what my colleagues are reductions and I think in the big scenario of things that will need to be done with some really careful planning and some more vision in next year 's budget as this budget stands the budget has been framed to ensure the organization is appropriately resourced to deliver the works services and initiatives set out in the revised council plan 2007 2021 it responds directly to the planned strategic objectives the council is a strong financial position and can provide the future generations for skips Landers it delivers a significant capital works program of 41 0.898 million dollars with a significant focus on the renewal of East Gippsland considerable into infrastructure it includes funding of 10.5 million of roads 3 million for bridges 4.4 for this been style aquatic Recreation Center and the project in home will cost six point three million over two years so it 's been split it also has a council contribution of 3.3 million and the Victorian Government will contribute matching amounts of three million dollars seven point six million will be spent on other Recreation and Park projects including Street scapes 1.5 million is trail with 50% of this project to be funded by government grant initiative which I think the bulk of the funding should come from 2.9 eight million has been put aside for waste projects which will be an area that we probably need to think severely or heavily about over the next 12 months on what 's going to happen in that space the budget includes six million dollars in landfill rehabilitation works which will be undertaken during the 2018 19 year impact of the increased cost of handling recyclable waste has add an additional 400,000 to the 1919 the 2018-19 operational budget and we 've been able to accommodate this by adding an additional 15 per curbside collection for the whole year it is expected to recover the the remainder of the Mount the amounts in cost these pleasing denote the council 's sound financial position over the four years of this strategic resource plan has been met and operational surpluses are expected in all areas despite that I think the major thing is that we are only 0.05 above the CPI and it is not an exorbitant map but I the whole region it 's not just the bean style area when you go to all boss 'd it 's it 's devastating to see and they 're making people in times of hardship are resilient and they may make great decisions and support each other through harder times the bottom line is we are seeing cost reductions in Melbourne as well and I think we 're probably coming into a stage of our economy where we 're actually meeting to consider reductions of some types so I look forward with my councillors to proceed next year on a rate reduction or a some kind of budget reduction with regards to what we 're actually asking the community to pay so thank you for with regards to that councillors I recommend this budget to you to support Thank You councillor pals as a second to councillor Colonel would you like to speak thanks mr. mayor just I would like to reiterate councilor pulses arguments it 's important to recognize that we do have a responsibility to hold the council on a strong financial position not just for the clarify a few points that I 'd like to make just as money is allocated to see wall post normal Street scapes streetscape projects projects like the owner mountain bike track will aid in economic development for the whole base Gippsland it 's not an aspirational project it 's got strong support from our federal and local Member and there are current applications in grant funding at a federal and state level which we shouldn 't find out in a few months hopefully not that long but the return on investment with council is significant and so light comes up help said there are projects across the Shire that will benefit all towns our 40 towns so let 's not cherry pick out projects just because yeah that 's all I have to say thank you Thank You councillor colony further speakers against council Roberts Thank You mr. mayor while I understand and applaud the tremendous type work that goes into the annual budget by mr. Collins and the team just not sold on it I know we face challenging times rate capping increase in waste recycling expenses among other I think we can do better we need to focus on maintaining our vital infrastructure and amenities roads footpaths and the like and I would like to see a little more realistic capital works budget and give our ratepayers some room to breathe perhaps some non-essential projects we post postponed to such a time when our economic outlook is a little clearer especially considering council will be required to Catherine 's municipal charge next year taking it from up to 20 percent down to 10 percent I 'm not saying that we shouldn 't be investing in our region of course that 's vital to the growth and viability of our Shire I just like to see us work within our means and not expected rape air for the ever-increasing bill thanks Council Robert 's speaking for ya I just had one against self talk speaker 4 no I 'm speaking against it cancer Ellis can you speak I 'm allowed to speak against I 'm just talking against him for you councillor Robert spoke against the village Thank You mr. mayor on I take this opportunity to speak to thank the the large number of peer citizens that made a submission this year to our budgets probably the highest number that we 've had so that 's a very healthy feel going through and having worked on the budget it 's very pleasing to report to the community that would know the Shire is in a fine and strong financial position the balances that we have kept and and the appropriate financial management exhibited by mr. canterna team and by our operational staff has shown through to the projects that we have been able to complete successfully this year one name he has to travel around the shoulder see the new bridge works the across the Shire the new footbridge works to name a few it 's acknowledged that we 've had a few buyouts that are concerning to us but we were in such a good position we 're able to manage those we won 't be looking for those problems in extreme I look forward next year to us working with council offices to provide an even better and stronger budget position so us that we can present time to support not only the poor old farms councillor wide refers to but also all sectors of our community that are in need of assistance through their local government ladies and gentlemen I commend the budget to you thanks counselor Ellis council Buckley speaking against much thank you mr. mee and this was in the ADI so renounced the gospel new measures to ensure service charge it 's levied by councils do not exceed the cost of these services well as I 've pointed out to you before with the 30 million dollar property he 's paying the same tax as the 1000 bloke so where 's the fairness in that 1,000 bloke at 1,000 whatever it is that the valuation capital improved value he 's paying the same amount is that the 30 million won so where 's the fairness in the fee for service for that thank you that mr. mee Thank You counselor Buckley counselor you wanted to speak for the motion Thank You mr. mayor I would I 'm speaking for the motion I think the the budget whilst it would be nice to this point it would be a prudent thing to do having said that I would look forward to making some savings next year and not having any of the issues that that we 've had in the last 12 months and be put in a position where potentially next year we we will be in a position where we could either limit the rate rise down to zero or closer to that and then what has been this year I see that it is important that we 're in a very strong position and I see that the putting in a rate rise this year will put us into a far stronger position on top of the savings that we 're hoping to gain from our budget and will allow us then to potentially look at a very limited increase next year thank you thanks to counselor to e speaker against the much council what oh I would just like it noted that the three counselors have spoken for the budget have muted how well for I 've said how well we are financial off and financially and then muted would just like it on the record that perhaps in the next twelve months that those three counselors stick to their word because then we may see something like that occur thank you so any further speakers if not I just had a quick comment thank to staff working with the constraints the assumptions our rating strategy you know in a rate capped environment of 2.25 percent a budget it 's been developed that will continue to deliver services to the community at the existing levels they expect and for not much more than two VicRoads vehicle registrations think about the services that get delivered out of this council thank you council pills thank you all have the right of reply if I may mr. mee you do have um interesting the comments around the table you can see that all councilors are quite passionate about their their vote and how they 're going to support it but needless to say the support of offices and also the community writing in and and letting us know where their thoughts on this particular budget I think was really appreciated and it and particularly to be able to resolve areas of concern for next year 's budget with regards to councilor white and his comments it wasn 't a tongue-in-cheek thing the bottom line was that you 've come to us a bit too late and we do all strive to deliver the same services at the right cost and to me the budget is something that is actually going to deliver us that and with regards to us supporting reductions for next year we were saying we were happy to work alongside you and deliver those if possible so I think you know we look forward to another year next year and I think the officers will be able to have some kind of insight on what direction counselors want ahead thank you all I commend this budget to you thanks Council pals that exhausts the debate I will now put the motion all those in favor five in favor those against three against the motion is carried thank you now being 654 p.m. the meeting is closed thank you _"

explain to miss Moulton the actions that were taken earlier so I have moved that miss ma please permitted to present a question to council Thank You councillor seconded council white all those in favor against that 's carried thank you Miss Molly would you like to don 't know whether I just I 've taken an extract from the appendix of the arborists assessment and report that underpins the proposal to deal with the trees precinct and I 'm calling into question the validity of the arborist report as the basis for underlying the health and safety risk assessment and I feel having read the report the arborist this report I think it 's got its weaknesses it 's a it 's responding to a very narrow brief and it doesn 't assess the historic Aboriginal cultural heritage value by its own admission of the trees nor the ecological value of the trees as a habitat for indigenous wildlife which by its own statement in appendix 3 on pages 6 and 7 of the appendix our other criteria on which trees should be assessed and considered in such a report miss alive question is where is the report on the historic Aboriginal cultural and heritage value of these tree and why is it not a factor in the decision making on the management of these trees on this site and where is the report of the evidence in the decision-making on the manager these trees end off this side thank you Miss Martin miss Nelson would you like to respond please yes the brief given to the arborist for this particular important there has been a number of reports provided to counsel by independent arborist was specifically narrow it was about understanding the risk that was presented by the trees and the reason for that very specific brief is because the approval that we have granted to it is by the Commonwealth government it was the mechanism for determining the ecological or other have given their habitat for bats and approval was granted to remove those despite the fact that they provide that ecological purpose as habitat for the gray-headed flying fox they species that we have removed all the way along the river in accordance we riparian revegetation and despite the fact that to remove them the arborist report Thank You mr. Nelson and question two was where support of the ecological raid the documentation that was submitted to the Commonwealth which is the vegetation talks about the value ecologically their value is as habitat that was it was a thank you me small yeah Norton say mister me EPS I could ask yes certainly counselor else the question of what what action was taken or what advice was given in relation to being discovered mrs. Moulton was I 'm here what what would have happened to her questions earlier and I 'll clarify my stumblings here by going that is it true miss Bennett that mrs. Martin 's questions would have been recorded in the minutes of this meeting and that any responses would also have been appended to the minutes of that meeting so that you the questions were recognized thank you yes I think from your comment earlier picked up from the form that you needed to be but because you weren 't we didn 't read out the question but you certainly would have received a direct response from the relevant council officer and that response would be attached to the back of the minutes when they 're published for the final time I think thank you for that clarification has been be no further business I closed the meeting at 07 thank you _"

Lee Fulton over me oh the only a mountain bike plan is the most exciting thing to happen in years and has galvanized some community as it is seen as a key major copy mountain bike trails in Victoria attracting visitors to try all trails in the state the community of MU is grateful for the council down 1 sure council committee oh one compartment really well to develop one that the decision are on that funding application or the outcome of the decision on that funding application will become known as roughly four weeks or sometime in May so we 're hopeful that we 'll get a positive response to our application additionally council staff have also been meeting with representatives of regional development of Victoria also seeking further funding to complete subsequent stages of that project Thank You mr. hull the second question is from mr. Leefolt Antonio it is my understanding that there was an audit by Council of o mio Street signage but the emphasis on tourists directional signs has it 's been completed his council able to update the wine and gold Drive signs in the Swift Swiss creeks and Romeo townships to include schematic Maps and distances I asked mr. weights to answer that question in response to the Meo Street signage audit I can 't answer just off the cuff whether that has been completed but I 'm certainly happy to respond to mr. mr. Fulton so I 'll take with respect to updating other tourist signage in Swiss Creek and I 'm you know more than happy to talk to my three greatest counterparts and see what can be done done there for improvements this next one from mr. Jeff Cooper Omiya chai rates municipal water etc I thought the GST return to the state was supposed to cover these charges 3hc our radio station run by volunteers CW Hall kindergarten oh thank you unfortunately that isn 't the case I 'm not aware either of in a plan under which GST would cover those charges in terms of community led organizations where rates are issue there 's a couple of options through which relief can be garnered or one is to object to the valuation on which rates other and the other one is to apply directly to counsel for some rate relief but unfortunately that won 't be coming from the GST end thank you the next question is from Rhonda man hi Oh meow Rhonda did ask a question about Lewiston Park and that report is to be tabled a little bit later so the first they 'd only be commenced Schwarz who 's the best of all Hill Road and I 'll actually put the second question because I 'll ask miss Nelson to answer both of these short street commissioners Galli off today Avenue car park area and bus turning option this would allow the school buses to be taken off day Avenue away from the school crossing and provide a much safer option for the children tourism benefit as two coaches could park on this flat section of only out close to the historical precinct and shops thanks thank you yes um my recollection is that with the Meo streetscape plans which were done quite a number of years ago is that we have actually completed two stages already so we were able to obtain funding for the main part of day Avenue and then extending out to the turnaround area which was funded part by Council and part by the Victorian Government there are other stages stage there is no commencement date further work on the omiyo streetscape isn 't part of councils 10 year capital works plan at this point in more in respect to Livingston Park the mountain biking and the connections between the CBD the benefits that can be derived from that and not on street scape funding it is worth noting that streetscape work that we do across the Shire has been substantially funded by both Council and the Victorian Government and at the moment it 's not easy to find funding sources for streetscape works under the current Victorian Government 's programs for regional development so it will be a case of understanding how we can continue to do stage streetscape updates over the next few years without that external funding source and in respect to Short Street and commissioners gully the question is do we have any firm plans to Pipe commissioners gully and create an extra parking maneuvering space and I have to be honest and say we don 't have any firm plans but certainly willing to understand what is being proposed and see whether that might be part of a future streetscape upgrade in that part of thank you the last question is from Danny Johnson of Tania Road oh yeah why am Road told it has to be at my expense why when I moved into my property and found no recycle bin I was told that I must replace it my expense mr. white sir Thank You mr. CEO with respect to waste bins any properties within a curbside collection district are provided with waste bins unfortunately at times when there 's a change of ownership of those properties every now and then bins go missing and council require the new property owner to purchase a replacement mean if if no pins exist at that time the property owner can write in once they 've paid for an acquire to being an astral review of the fee if they believe there 's some exceptional circumstances that should be considered with respect to road access understand this as a property within the township the township itself and so it 's a bit surprising that there 's no road access but certainly take the opportunity while I 'm here after the meeting today together bulk and then I 'll be able to respond to mr. Johnson thank you thank you mr. White 's is Assemblies of councillors we have a recommendation on that report move councillor Reeves second council Roberts any questions I 'll put that motion all those in favor against its carried unanimously thank you item 1.9 mr.

introduced council meetings outside of the corporate center and Ben stone as the mayor alluded to the meeting hasn 't been held in arm you know since amalgamation and the crowd in the gallery is testament to the importance of council getting out and about provides an opportunity for the communities outside of then style to come along engage in local issues it 's the important step in demonstrating the shyest commitment to all areas of East Gippsland and just to add to that ice cubes in water have also seen the importance of getting outside in style with their monthly meeting being held in romeo recently too and with the live-streaming now often running council meetings are more accessible in a bus so well done to everyone involved in making this happen today thank you Thank You

Ellis Thank You mr. mee people quite short short and sharp as others have done a very busy month this month couple highlights included the held in my written report participating in the re-energized timber towns advocacy group which was a to hold first annual meeting to some time and sure on the far side of the state for error energies and appointment as chair of this group a highlight for me and life experience was attending and presenting to the Australian Commonwealth Senate committee with impacts on climate change on coastal communities and infrastructure held in Melbourne there 's a member of the Australian coastal councils and I was able there to promote not only the national body 's position but identify Chum don 't shy as a separate entity on my further attended the Australian coastal councils workshop at forum and conference in Jalan this year the speakers and topics were particularly high standard this year and as is appropriate copies of the presentations will be provided to councillors and officers in the coming week I have a number of other matters but they can be read in the minutes Thank You mr. mayor thanks counselor Islands council why thank you mr. mee just a couple of events that I attended on Saturday and able-bodied members of our community that were paddling from the rowing side and band style all the way to me tongue that they call themselves the court of the sail to see disability challenged they are a tremendous group of people who raise money for others who are disabled particularly for people who are in a position where they need specialist equipment that actually can 't provide it through their own funding and you know they 're a great group of people so great pleasure in numb sending them on their way I did not participate in the paddle and then the following Monday a very good event which was well attended by many people across the community was the the donation of the mobile stage for the dolls and family to the Shire and it was there was a bit of thought about you know how this would go but by the enthusiasm of those who attended and people lining up as participants of wanting to hire this stage across the shop or the many events Ivan well I just really like to think that I 'll stand how well this is used for lots of outdoor events um because it is purposeful or for a band or the events and yeah as I said I really do look forward to it there one since the since the last meeting I did speak at that meeting about visiting Western Australia and done a bit more research on proposals and it 's disappointing to know that when we were in West Australian visiting her mining and the sheriff Capel that that they failed this is all actually on the internet but they failed to tell us the mine site that we visited that they 'd had a breach of one of their dams and the contaminants are going to the underground water table what is this part of your your report yes yeah I just decided that it was just disappointing that we we worked out of this William they appear now to have said it can be cleaned up it could take up to twenty years to bring that water back to pure and they 'd also shown us some slides of a rehabilitated mind in Victoria which and this mine is just being used as a dump site so just a little bit disappointing that on a fact-finding tour that we were given all the facts thank you Thank You counsel like the first time I 'd like talk about his community resilience Swift Creek Bush nursing center celebrated a hundred years of community service the official event was also attended by councils O 'Connell Buckley and reads the celebration coincided with the official opening of the emergency vehicle accommodation Sylvie this facility was jointly funded through a generous donation of the free masons foundation along with the Department of Health and Human Services the next key thing was around celebrating diversity in culture and the arts and news gives an art gallery Sofie jus had calling for an exhibition quite fitting given that we are calling for rain sophie is born in France lives in Sydney and is very very experienced artists and we 're lucky to have people like Sophie coming and the exhibition was successful on the basis that by Sunday night we had received 10 ml rain across the Shire we were lucky our region Sophie 's exhibited her art at the great up on our gallery and Swiss Creek also on a more serious note protecting and nurturing our children to enable them to achieve their full potential the launch of the well-being of children and young people east gippsland report 2018 this launch was held at the community hub on Monday the 26th of March the report updates 24 key indicators identified by the community that helped tell us how well children and young people are doing in East Gippsland the previous report was published in late 2013 the report was launched by Save the Children CEO Paul Ronald 's the importance and significance of gathering and sharing such key data about a young people and children gives us the opportunity to compare these statistics against the 2013 data set the statistics gives us a nice cube snow eats Gippsland regional snapshot on how we compare across the state and Australia there are some serious negative bad trends for our region relating to bullying the collecting of such critical data allows us to know how we are currently performing and more the opportunity to identify priority areas and do something about it what gets measured gets done I have a copy of the report in office for councillors to read the next item was an advocacy trip to the snow mirror Regional Council on a visit to the country University 's Centre in the snow a narrow country universities koomer has been operational for most 5 years and that time has seen 190 students registered to use the centre studying 50 undergraduate degrees and 44 postgraduate degrees from 30 different universities the centre is also hosted over 700 students sitting exams and facilitated 1,400 students attending face-to-face tutorials I believe this tertiary hub model would be a game-changer for our region to uptake of young people and mature Aiden students wanted to study and further either the career or a changing career or more importantly getting a degree if that 's a desire now a skips a statistic for our young people taking up tertiary studies is extremely low compared the state in the Australian averages the other damning statistic is the high number of students who drop out after their the snowy manera Regional Council who provide the building and site for the facility and sponsored by Snowy Hydro and the number of other corporates supporters the facility offers seven days a week serve a.m. to midnight support students flexibility to study any course from any university in your own time independent study supported degrees dedicated study zones aid in computer workstations BYO device facilities and hotspots extra fast internet and white flight training facilities and video conferencing I 'd like to ask our CEO and staff to contact done container co-op country universities and extend the invitation to Duncan come over and do a presentation to want to be our counselor briefing sessions at some point to see whether we could actually adopt a similar model here in East Gippsland the other important advocacy role was the CEO myself attended a number of meetings in Canberra this week we met with Federal Minister for regional development local government the Honorable dr. John McVay to discuss a number of key projects for the region and more importantly the regional growth fund that he 's just recently announced a federal member and projects that were discussed range from current funding applications to strategic innovative future projects as a as identified in our recent councilor major projects workshop Minister McVeigh gave a significantly strong feedback and support for our identified initiatives he also commented favorably in relation to our advocacy style he gave us a brick a briefing on we 're applications of at the moment with building better Regents which we have to current in that currently being considered for funding one is the omiai mountain bike park and the other is an important water augmentation project in relation to our industrial state we should know in four weeks how successful both those applications are the other key message we took to Canberra that resonated with the minister was we have the opportunity east gippsland to create growth through cooperation with governments advocacy efforts in the lead-up to this year 's Victorian state election thank you [Applause] item 5.1 is a stronger communities report 5.1.1 and there 's a recommendation there over to you mr. weights Thank You mr. mayor councillors throughout the year council receives and requests from residents who to have those roads added to councils Road register and thereafter being maintained by council and there are a number of criteria that council officers use when assessing those requests and today we have five such requests covering roads depo Road your Golf Course Road Janome Oh longer bail rated you know a bluff Road it now now Bayes tracker can River and upper Livingston Road at home you of those five roads for have been recommended in this report rating to the road register v the one that 's not being recommended is up a Livingston Road and the reason that hasn 't been recommended is one of the key criteria for adding roads to the public road registries that they serve a principal place of residence that particular Road doesn 't and there are numerous similar roads throughout the show that may access farming lands but not directly to residential residential properties or principal places of residence and therefore other Livingston Road hasn 't been recommended for inclusion two of the roads in the list will require some upgrading before council takes them on and that is again spent to bring them up to a basic standard before council takes them on so the recommendation before you today is that one gravel road and Bluff Road be able to the road register without any further upgrading being required that depo Road and Bay 's track he 's taken onto the road register once upgrading has been undertaken by the abutting landowner or the requesting landowner and that upper Livingston Road not be added to councillors public road register Thank You counsel Thank You mr. White 's any questions councilors there 's a recommendation do I have a mover for the recommendation like to move an amendment to the motion Council O 'Connor would like to move an amendment I 'd like to move an amendment that the up Livingston Road be added to the road register once it 's been upgraded and completed to council satisfaction so moved counselor Ellis do in a second counts council Reeves yep okay I 'd like to move an amendment that I put Livingston I 'd be added to the public road register once it 's been upgraded to council satisfaction to you like to speak to your amendment this came up to us last year and I requested that this be included to the public road register currently this road is graded to approximately the 11 K mark historically the road was graded beyond this point the third one point at kilometer that is being requested so at some point along that there has been a change I 'm not sure why so there is an inconsistency there this road is supportive of a farmer a business being able to make his contribution to the economy and as a sure we should be encouraging our businesses to be able to do that thanks council o 'connell council Buckley did you want to speak as a seconder thank you this to me there 's other people along yes free its Laura and foster and another one and they don 't have permanent residence on them and the road the public road goes right up to their place and on this diagram here that I got from Tim booth actually himself which I have roughly shows where those properties are and it seems is just a little bit further on to the south fitted to the southwest on Flanagan 's a you know and so I think it 's a bit unfair that the three powders on the way in have got the benefit of a public road when Flanagan hasn 't because they 're in the same situation and there is a through connection to it 's only option up step and a jump from plan against boundary up and there 's an active track there I know it 's graded but there 's an active track and I think in fairness to Flanagan that I think that road should be put back on the register I think I wish to me thanks counsel Buckley any further speakers for against cancer all right soldier the speak against something and omiai when you know me I see but let 's have a look at this in the cold day the report has previously been brought towards canceled and my memory was that this piece of road only goes to several stockyards it doesn 't go to a primary place of residence which is our permit I should say I 'm getting tongue-tied a permit roads to be added to our register there 's been no justification for mr. Flanagan 's cattle yards to be added to our roads register it 's contrary to the will of our policy in relation to this matter it would open a Pandora 's box of application should we allow just this simple what seems to be just a simple little request to a decent man that being the case I cannot support the amendment and I other councillors to to reject the application before us thinking thanks counselor Ellis any other speakers against council roots look ladies and gentlemen I have to agree with counselor Ellis I think that there are several thousand kilometers of roads potentially that could be end up on our Road register and it 's okay if we 're happy to have continuously increasing rates and pay for them but we have to make that judgment as well around one point eight kilometers here they 're 20 times one point eight kilometers project that we 're up against and the counselors I think to sometimes make the hard decisions about these matters and and have a metric around them and we have that which is a principal place of residence and when we have that I think we should respect that policy otherwise we run into problems and as council L said a Pandora 's box Thank You councillor ease any further speakers just a question mr. mee but I have the right of reply to those comments thank you just that it seemed to me that a million dollars was a fair bit of money to spend on a short a short stretch of road it 's already made up saying hey mr. mee thanks counsel buck right right it 's like counselor I appreciate the comments of counselor Alison Reeves and and and they do make a fair point however this this does highlight any consistency because as counselor Buffy said there is no principal place of residence beyond where that road is graded so why does it stop where it does and historically this was graded it changed sometime after my ovation I 'm not sure why but if we a million dollars for a ferry that we don 't get to use I think is a fair point think we read a yes sorry that far thanks counselor icon olam thank you Thank You counselor oh all those against the amendment against the amendment it 's lost so now we get to the the actual motion which is the recommendation any further speakers I think if this say something to the motion you know that seeing the fairies been raised and come on dangerous grounds the I certainly am that I am you know me I look the report by mr. weights is to the point the issue stand considerations have been raised by counsel O 'Connor and councillor Buckley an additional row to the register counsels we hope we manage over 3,000 kilometres of roadways we have an outstanding amount of work to be done on those roadways we have to be careful managers on the expenses and expansion of those roadways the report is reasonable the arguments for the other three roads are valid and therefore I recommend that you adopt the recommendation of mr. waves thank 'll put the recommendation all those in favor one to five in favor against three against thank you [Applause] now item that five point one point two is Nelson Thank You mr. mayor this report has presented to provide counsel and the community with an update in respect to the activities of our disability Advisory Committee it 's a requirement of Commonwealth legislation that we have a disability Advisory Committee or organizations like councils do the focus of the committee is on ensuring that councils own practice and way of working is constantly improving accessibility given all of the work that we do and the services that we deliver into the community and the leadership role that council has in improving people 's understanding of diversity and inclusiveness and accessibility so the report that 's attached to this agenda item has been prepared with input from our of disability Advisory Committee working together with the the council staff so it 's a collaborative effort that you 're seeing and it provides a really good update in respect to outcomes that have been achieved over the last two years and you report a significant focus of the committee has been to work on reducing barriers that prevent people with a disability participating in economic activities and social life and that so they participate in the social activities in the community and the priorities for the next 12 months continue to focus on improving the reduction of barriers to people for employment and participation in employment and educational opportunities and also to work to make sure that our community is well-positioned to transition to the new National Disability Insurance Scheme and happy to answer questions thank you Miss nelson questions councillors no questions we do have a recommendation before us we have a mover you know councils taking a counselor to e speakers the this piece of work is particularly important for our communities our whole councils has discussed and debated and read this document in over a period of 12 months or longer and as an as a member of this particular committee I can only commend the report and the policies to Council and just look forward to its ambitions being achieved over the coming firm of this council Thank you last week just to say that this has been a great report really very comprehensive and has come up with some very good outcomes which is very pleasing any speakers against any further speakers for council reads well thanks mr. mayor councillors it 's always a measure of our our community as to how we treat those in greatest need and to have a report like this and a guide for us a moral guide if you like almost like a third chamber if you like to keep an eye on what we do to ensure that we are an inclusive community is very important and I think the committee for their their work thanks council Reeves any further speakers although if we 'll put the motion all those in favor against it 's carried unanimously thank you adam 5.2.1 is the adoption of the draft Livingston Park management plan for Romeo and in the tents we have mrs. Weigle thank you Thank You mr. mayor helpers I think it 's quite appropriate that we bring this report to really the April meeting given that this meeting is being important asset for the Leo it 's well aware it 's had a long history as being an important part of the fabric of the younger community a very important recreational point for the community and before that it was important it 's part of the gold mining heritage of this area councils as part of that importance and we 've also heard from mr. Halton earlier in the meeting about the plans for and I 'm your mountain bike child and the importance of this new activity in this new new economic generation could bring for you Livingston Park is a really important part of that I 'm a mat and bike trail comp proposal it 's where a lot of the trails would head off from and also brings a place where the riders can congregate in town at the end of it so it has both a current use a potential future use and a lot in history for a lot of years the the management of the that living some Park which is all Crown land but some was managed by ourselves somewhat Spanish bike job ad hoc to say that the been released therefore in 2009 a management plan which developed and that was used to guide some of the hum the Battlement projects that took place after flooding in 2012 Oh in 2016 with great community input the plan was reviewed and the management plan that you have before us is of an outcome of both the learnings from the first management plan and the community consultation many of the recommended actions in the in the planet are directly looking at mitigating risk improving amenity improving accessibility ensuring that the park has greater resilience into the future with stone withstand future natural disaster events should they occur it 's fair it 's a great piece of work and I believe the work that has gone into it and which will show if it will be well delivered into the future the recommendations and they are quite extensive and really cover lot of activities some of the responsibilities of counsel but some is the responsibility of other agencies however some of the high priority actions are really around that the trails and the pool that bit of work so the recommendations that do have some high priority actions which are valued about 1.1 million which adds miss Nelson said earlier in the day we will need to be starting to look at funding opportunities for to attract that funding part of that is having a an adopted plan which is a plan that 's adopted by council before the the recommendation in the report to today 's to to adopt the Livingston management plan as it was as revising in 2018 and like that the recommendations would be subject to a normal budgetary and business planning processes thank you very much having to take any questions thank you Miss Bogle questions from councillors councillor I call thanks miss Weigel and it 's great to have this report finally coming to us they 're high priority actions are really important and are you able to give a timeline I know we 're subject to budgetary conditions and external funding that would be good to know if there 's a timeline that you have in mind as to when these might be completed some of them will of those are the funding opportunities that have been spoken about already build into and look at some of the opportunities we 're also meeting on a regular basis with state and federal funding bodies to look at the opportunities that are arrived we 're talking to Regional Development Victoria about some of the opportunities in here and we 'll also be working with Sport and Recreation Victoria to see if there may be some opportunities around the funding of the pool through that really it 's a it 's about us trying to get the right match with the funding program and we 're regularly meeting with funding bodies to try and do that so I think that some of it is actually embedded in the budget what we already have for the mountain bike trails and some of it will need to go out and source additional funding for hey you miss one counselor I call we for example the pool is if further drafting works or you know plans that would have to be completed prior to your getting funding as I think um we 've mentioned need to work with some life-saving Victoria it 's thought and recreation Victoria to make sure that the plans are robust and make their funding requirements so there is a little bit of additional work that needs to be done that would then put up a funding application in really good stead yes any further questions councillors okay we have a recommendation before us Youth Council O 'Connell scenic council like the speaker 's cool thanks mr. mayor I just as I said before very happy to be making this moving to accept this adopted plan it 's been a long time in the making there 's some people in the gallery who have been a part of seeing this come to fruition and creating the park as we see it today sorry I 'm sure there 'll be some very happy people to say that this is finally part of the council 's plan and they can finally come to fruition sorry thank you for getting it to end to end I think it was me to say I 'm this morning it is a beautiful spot and this mount there and I think the improvements that could be made would just make it even more popular to people passing through town and to those who live here or than that as I said watching that water just trickling down through there it 's a beautiful spot and I 'm much in favor of the improvements thank you thanks council wife and any further speakers either against or for I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carried unanimously thank you [Applause] item five point two point two is he skips Lane plane skiing amendment 2018 and we have miss Dalton oh sorry sorry miss one jump there thank you Miss Smith as councils are well aware this game is a really important document for four counts me as the planning authority it is the document which guides planning decisions throughout the organization that 's the the parameters for how land is developed where land can develop and what is considerations around land development so a very important document for us as such we are always looking at the document and the planning scheme and working can remove some of the red tape how we can reduce the number of planning applications that may need to come forward and how we can respond to changing circumstances as well as those on those ongoing reviews the state government also requires that within 12 months of the council plan being adopted the the planning scheme and in particular the municipal strategic statement part of the planning scheme is reviewed by council so the report before you and the attachment is that review of the planning scheme amendment outside of the planning scheme which considers rhythm approachment we 've taken is to look at the major planning issues that have been key drivers for change to document the strategic work that it 's been completed during the review period and to reaffirm our commitments to undertaking place-based planning scheme reduce to facilitate growth throughout all of our townships it 's part of a planning scheme review like this there 's often a requirement to look at what they call the form and content really go through line by line as they change this and change that if with this government is in the process of introducing what they 're calling smart planning and smart planning they 're saying we 'll introduce a whole lot of reforms to the planning scheme itself so therefore we saw that it was timely to consider those reforms before we make major recommend major changes to the way that the planning scheme is outlined and prepared and presented we saw that we could undertake a lot of office the time undertaking that work to only have it overturned through a state government process so therefore we 've looked at it really to make sure that we 're maintaining our strategic focus instead in the planning scheme ensure that we continue to own and commitment to making planning scheme amendments and those are driven by a theory or an approach around continuous improvement and to establish a framework for moving forward part of that it 's also one of the recommendations you will note councillors is to introduce at least quarterly workshops with council so we can discuss not only the planning scheme amendments are coming forward but more generally what 's happening in that new approach for us and I believe is one that will work really well the size of the review really fun doing a lot of great work we 've had over 25 planning scheme amendments over the last four years we 've had a lot of submissions to state government and influence on the state 's planning scheme and responded to things like in the introduction of bushfire and management overlays and things that are instigated by the state so I think what the we 've found from the planning scheme review that there has been some great work and it 's important that we continue that work regardless of what the the framework is that the planning scheme may look like into the future so before you councils a series of recommendations some of those as sort of the cosmetic cellphone making sure that we 've after you 're considered and adopted be hopefully adopted the the review it is um it 's not provided to the the midst of the planning as per the requirements others of the foundations around noting that we will continue to direct future to hold these quarterly workshops with Council so I 'm happy to take any questions on any bits of the review it 's quite a lengthy document itself which again demonstrates how much work has been undertaken over the past four years thank you thank you miss waggle thank you to you for presenting this report questions counselors there 's no questions we have a recommendation before us have a move that council Reeves second that councillor O 'Connell speakers no no speakers okay count so comments for the benefit of the people in the gallery thank you nice waggle it is a lot of hard work that 's going on into this report and I 'm just pleased to say that in your current and further strategic work that the scraping of the onions owning land use has been added and further work will be done in that in due course but it will assist with future residential and industrial development in town so that 's great thank you no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against mr. Carrigan obviously thank you item five section 173 agreement a if to zero to nine to three j72 actually Street Painesville in that tenants we have mr. Hollow Thank You mr. mayor councillors this proposal T in the agreement cemetery especially speak pains or will be familiar to you all as council provide an in-principle approval to move this process through its requirements under planning environment act councillors this agreement as a relates to see me to actually Street resulted from two previous large subdivision proposals on a greater site having to work together in terms of linking roads and the like unfortunately the agreement prevents the land from being further subdivided and in our view there is no reason to prevent this lot from being further subdivided as it is located within a an appropriate central locality area for the township it 's within the edge of a growth it 's close to community facilities such as the plains or primary school counselors on that basis it went to public consultation there was no submissions for or against and as such council officers or the view that for good planning reasons this agreement should be questions Thank You mr. although questions councillors have the recommendation if there 's no questions we need to move it move consul Robert second counselor to you and your speakers I 'll put that motion all those in favor against it 's carried unanimously thank you item five point two point four is a planning permit application 1028 MP use and development of a convenience restaurant takeaway food premises alteration of access to a road zone category 1 and development of advertising signage at 26 and 4 to 30 Main Street bends down mr. Lowe Thank You mr. mayor councillors once again this application will be familiar to you as it was subject to a planning consultation meeting that took place earlier this year proposal over our three current Lots being four to six four to eight and for 30 Main Street bends down it provides for a convenience restaurant I take away food premises associated car parking vehicle access ever toes advertising site and alteration to access into mainstream which is a big road mr. hollar can use told council buckley yeah thank you mr. mee this is a didn 't really have a conflict of interest in this but I think I may have so I would prefer to believe that there 's the China Thank You counsel please continue miss Toller sorry about that Thank You mr. mayor councillors you will recall that this application was subject to a plain consultation meeting the main concerns of the seven objectives was a mention basic concerns as well as some concerns about traffic safety the application was referred to numerous agencies including VicRoads who did not object to the proposal but in the VicRoads case requested some conditions to be placed on a notice of decision to grant a permit should one be issued councils we have recommended that the application be supported with inclusion of conditions to address matters such as noise impacts lighting impacts traffic requirements car parking and loading times and the like and we believe that with the inclusion of these conditions we 'll have an application and a proposal which is consistent with these keeps a planning scheme on that basis counsels the recommendation for approval and happy to take questions Thank You mr. move move counselor I also have a second counselor to eat the speakers the report provided the counsel there has been quite detailed in in its content it 's an another opportunity for the city of bends down to improve its retail sector it 's it 's been considered in all aspects with good consultation with the neighborhood surrounding the applica the proponents application I recommend the application to council Thank You councillor else councilor to it would you last week business even know any further speakers counsel reaps I 'm happy to speak to it to mr. mayor I understand the concerns that were raised with the objections but I also acknowledge the conditions that have been placed on the recommendation and that should allay the concerns they wore that fit escape I think it 's the right place for it thanks mr. hollows thanks counsel reads there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against miscarried could somebody retrieve counsel Buckley think item five point three point one it 's a planning permit application delegations policy you stole the conductivity of ECM conduct of a planning as as well as extending the number of objections received before a matter will be in referred to Council for consideration however it also introduces a new mediation meeting that would be conducted should there be more than five objections or less than ten in respect of a planning permit application it lays out very clearly the grounds under which councilors may call in a planning permit application for consideration before the chamber and also outlines a process whereby officers would provide information to the councilors in order to assist them to make their decisions around calling in or not calling in the policy is quite comprehensive and replaces two to notice or two motions or adopted by council something like eight years apart and it sets out the whole process quite clearly in a policy document and and as with all policy documents quite clear and happy to take questions questions counselors counsel why mr. day a question then on your last comment about it being reviewed quite regularly is there a time frame please can we is the review date that the policy can all the policies are reviewed at the beginning of the life of the council any further questions okay councils we have a recommendation before us we have a mover counselor ease second that councillor O 'Connell speakers yeah thanks mr. mayor I just commend the work done by officers at our request to try and best practice from examples and situations both in the state and outside the state and councillors I really commend this work and hope that you 'll vote for it it allows for transparency as mr. Halton noted it will embed some new processes that allow counselors to have greater control to be vested in those decisions and it also becomes I think some confusions over some triggers in the past it also allows us to acknowledge some of the planning applications that have community interest and good community outcomes as a result not just that might be controversial but also that might be of significance to our community this is a great outcome and councillors we should celebrate this and vote for it thank you calories counselor I call I just like to read all great policy and procedure presented to us yeah this afternoon thank you to mr. Holton and his team for working on on this lengthy document support here today will show a clear strong message to our community in a skip plan that council has adopted best practice and it 'll enable us to get on with business in a fair and equitable way and our process will be a business and community critical infrastructure enable us in importantly council we briefed on significant planning parents as counselor II said not just a monetary value but public value and community interests and the clear concise delegation authorities relating to planning payments and PC ohms now includes the mediation step prior to the PCM which is the important step so I did again urge you to all support this thank you sending further speakers councils Thank You mr. Mehra for this opportunity to speak against this recommendation before council councillors are they I 've read through the reports and the recommendations contained in the the supporting report to the policies the yet although it 's pleasing to see the work that has I can draw your attention back to the fact that this issue was brought by an aide to counsel because of what I term the hopeless case where the inappropriate action was taken in my view in relation to failure to provide proper and clear transparency in the handling of a significant planning application that in fact will impact on for good and for bad but for good Pronk primarily I assume on this community the recommendations in the report do not resolve the issues raised by the three or more trigger the actions of the person involved in the Hoch scandal in announcing that the air comes over expecting outcomes of the planning application cannot be addressed by the recommendations by in this report so even though it 's good will we still won 't be able to maintain that strength of transparency that counselor reads referred to the extension of the ten or more it takes away the role of counsel as a mediator then it comes back to two or more the understanding of all issues of importance that come before us as a council will not number of reasons and I 'm not an in the process of saying this I acknowledge the work that 's being done but it 's been Russ true in a three-month period without wider wider access to a perhaps interstate or even overseas planning Pro activities well I just don 't know where these recommendations come but could be parochial in the sense of being Gippsland based I just don 't know that so what I 'm saying to you is please support me in rejecting this outcome and ask the officers to return to their research and come back with something the theme is good because we do need to improve and handling of all their planning processes but we still have that problem of transparency and we need to address that as a as a prime cause so for those reasons mr. mee I ask that the matter be rejected thank you thanks counselor Ellis speakers for the motion any further speakers against the motion yeah thanks councillors respectfully counselor Ellis I just want on the record that I don 't think there was any such thing as opportunity and a bright light of hope that was raised with us when that planning matter was approved and I think that there is confusion around the hope scandal or hope opportunity and this planning matter that is before us now and I think we should separate the two there was no scandal around the Hope Center and they 're planning let 's be get that on the record again that that 's a planning matter was dealt with under delegation as it should have been and that was quite appropriate this new delegations policy will allow counselors who find those matters of such great importance and opportunity for the community to actually raise them and to raise their status and to ensure that the community is aware of them so it is a great opportunity for us there 's no scandal and secondly on the matter of being rushed through well I don 't think that there was anything more rushed than the notice of motion that was put before us at that meeting to change that delegation policy or that that trigger policy that was the most rushed quite passionately against it and I urged counselors at the time to vote it down and you didn 't so here 's your opportunity to redress that and we have a very well consider not rushed well considered well research policy that will be of benefit to the community and I 'm sure we will see there 50 signatories again writing to the paper thanking us for this considered new policy please thanks councillors okay okay councillors I 'll now put the motion all those in favor against motions carried six for two against thank you item five point three point two its proposed new lease arrangement 100 Langford parade thankfully Mr Cashman and it 's thank you Thank You mr. mayor the report before you seeking Council 's approval to terminate the current lease we have with Painesville and district and kindergarten incorporated and reach you a new agreement with the management agent which is now in place in place sorry so pains book kindergarten incorporated has been the lessee of the site of a hundred lengths of parade Painesville for a number of years Council officers have been entity within its own right and with that and with that entity in existence the association is currently not performing the management and governance duties of that kindergarten anymore in early 2015 council officers became aware that the Uniting Church in Australia property trust was in process of becoming the managing agent of that kindergarten your nighted committed to undertaking the drafting of the lease document in place however that that did not eventuate so council has prepared the lease arrangement and now we have that presented to you today the expiry date we have left all their lease arrangement arrangements as is in comparison with the current lease agreement except for the expiry date at present Uniting hold five kindergarten leases throughout the show all of those expiring on the 30th of June 2028 so with that in mind we have drafted the new proposed lease for you this lease will need to be a publicly advertised in accordance with section one nine zero of the Local Government Act and should we receive any submissions objecting to that lease then we will undertake a section two to three process my ask Council to approve the recommendations before you thank you thank you Miss Cashman counsels questions there 's no questions we have a recommendation before us we have a mover Council Robert seen a counselor tui the speakers put the motion all those in favor against it 's carried unanimously thank you five point three point three that 's proposed Lisa Lane part 59 Main Road painful to Optus mobile proprietor limited miss catchment Thank You mr. mayor council has been approached by the catalyst group on behalf of Optus mobile proprietary limited in respect of establishing a telecommunications facility in Paynesville the facility proposed includes a tower and equipment cabinet it 's in a Sorento the surrounding compound the land at 59 main road Paintsville has been identified as the potentially suitable site and this being the AJ Freeman reserve some of you may be aware that this particular reserve is home to a number of sporting clubs the area that we 're seeking to lease to Optus proprietary limited is eighty two point eight eight meters squared and that we are looking to formalize at least for and used for the community again this is another lease where we will have to publicly advertise the agreement in accordance with section one nine zero and again if we receive any submissions and we will be bringing that to our section two to three meeting further report so if there 's any other questions or not I ask that council receive those recommendations and ask you to consider those thank you thank you Miss cash with any questions from councillors it council Reese Mr Cashman thanks for that you mentioned that this site is on a rec Reserve is that right or and and who are the the users of that rec Reserve can you just feel me on that please yes thank you council rates I believe at the moment the Paintsville Tennis Club and the paint 's will Cricket Club of their main constituents on that yeah Mr Cashman will they be any beneficiaries of this lease payment I don 't believe counsel reads that that is the case at the moment any further questions counselors counselors if I the mere take up on counselors points or now there 's a tower here does does this particular location receive any benefit from the rental monies that come in from Optus and Telstra for those sort of facilities and I believe there are other examples in without threat to show I 'm just a prop sorry counselor is the short answer that is no councils policy is that rentals that are received from these kind of infrastructure facilities do not go back to the the recreation Reserve Committee management on which they see it however I might pass across to miss Nelson to just explain what happens with this particular scenario the the policy that counsel most recently adopted in respect to this matter makes it abundantly clear that rental income from council owned property effectively or manage property on behalf of the community does not go back to that committee and there are good reasons why that that happens because you know we fund committees to look after after land on our behalf and on behalf of the community not all reserves have an external funding source just because they haven 't been located well for communications the organization as a whole and it 's distributed across all of the committees of management across the Shire in the case of the omiyo there was some confusion about whether the rental would be would come back directly to this reserve and in good faith council has entered into another arrangement another three-year arrangement with this particular committee as a result of the expectations that were created falsely that the income would come back to them on a permanent basis so council is committed I think it 's five thousand dollars a year for three years as a result of that confusion any further questions Council so no further questions there is a recommendation before us maybe for counsel seconded councillor Connell any speakers counsel to it so as I understand what counsel does do is is not returned any profit from leasing this land that counsel funds all of these recreational reserves anyway as part of our normal course of events so more than happy to to support this recommendation thank you so any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carried delegation council to members of staff thank you mister me before you councillors is the revised instrument of delegation names s6 for councils consideration and adoption this is just routine update of those particular delegations in accordance with advice we received from medics solicitors in that in this report and the updates that have been made there 's a new power that has been inserted in regards to their food act on today 1984 in regards to a temporary or mobile food premises being able to be ordered to not keep all use for sorry not keep or be used for the sale handling or preparation of any food subsequently a new Power has been inserted under the section 173 of the Planning and Environment Act but that purely relates to the euro strategic plan and the planning scheme that relates to the area River so probably not particularly our patch so there are have been some so there 's been some minor Corrections made to officer top titles throughout that document and I hope that everything else that you 've seen there is in order happy to field any thank you questions councillors moved counselor Ellis a second counselor counselor thank you speakers the delegations are necessary for the effective carrying out of the business of local government in East Gippsland it 's a it 's a routine delegation name there should be supported thank you thanks counselor Ellis any other speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you so item by five point three point five is an emetic council meeting scheduled 2018 mr. mayor we would like to add a slight amendment to number one where it says draft budget correct con 218 1240 boardwalk construction works meet um road meet um we 've been able to bring that do the evaluation that contract it 's a rather a large one for me turn and we 'd just like to put that in the special council many as well councils aware the CEO is wanting to add the meeting board look in this recommendation yes guess how this always got to be a party-pooper well I 'm imagine this as a capital words program for some consequence and councils not have briefing on that project before the council meeting on the 17th of yeah I um what we obviously discussing item five point three point five which is seeking approval council to conduct a special council meeting we have foreshadowed in the report that there are two specific items we want to discuss on the 17th of April should council agree to that special council meeting being held what the CEO is seeking to do is add a further one being this contract in the meeting boardwalk apologize mr. CEO i i 'm misinterpret what he said took it that he was wanting to introduce it into the day 's meeting and that 's my mistake i 'm just about his kittens special meeting we 're clear on that now there any other questions mr. night questions here is the recommendation do i have a mover seconded counselor to e speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against mr. Carrigan answer thank you so we do need to first of all mr. CEO is only urgent business not mr. Muir Island seven is confidential business and we orders yeah what I didn 't hear anything about urgent business did you mention that yes I did I asked if there was any urgent business he didn 't say urgent urgent business oh okay I missed that I 'm sorry mr. me but I do have it 's definitely not urgent but I do want to make a comment about that because urgent business is a pretty hard so the judgment to make you know collectively and I think it should be changed back to just general business like it used to be in the past and anyway I 'll deal with that at the next meeting maybe with emotion and that 'll cover that particular issue but while I 've got the floor I 'd just like to say thanks to the locals that have turned up and shown a real interest in this so thank you very much for coming in and in to see us thank you so just for the benefit of the gallery we will need to close the meeting for a short moment just to discuss some contractual stuff and then we 'll meeting and you 're invited for afternoon tea yes unfortunately for momentarily we need to clear the gallery and _"

been a public questions thank you we have three public questions the first is from Louise would you like to read your question if you do I 'll ask you to come to the table for the microphone Thank You counselors and director my question um oh I 'm sorry I just introduce myself i 'm secretary of gibson environment group my question regards the East Gippsland shires MoU with round up minerals the original banana mine in 1998 the company we need to administration and walked away from the site forfeiting its 375,000 rehabilitation behind den has left behind a tailings dam containing 700,000 tons of tailings leaking acid and heavy metals zinc copper cadmium Magnum is led an arsenic into straight Creek on the headwaters of the Tambo River the dam had been constructed without a spillway and was at risk of breaching the dam was also constructed using a concrete grout curtain and plastic liner on the inside of the dam wall to prevent seepage both measures which have a limited lifespan whereas the tailings must remain quarantined from the downstream environment forever in 206 the department of primary industry we ability at the mine site and tailings dam at a total cost to the taxpayer of almost seven million dollars between 1999 and to oh five the epa permitted releases of a hundred and sixty mega litres of contaminated water from the dam to prevent the dam wall overtopping and additional releases of 140 mega litres prior to remediation it works on the dam wall and construction of a spillway the EPA permitted the ANZAC 95% protection for biodiversity freshwater limits yet this was acceded to such an extent that releases how to be halted with the zinc levels almost 800 times higher than the objective the dam is currently leaking contaminated water at a rate of 86 thousand liters per day and the spillway operates as a flow through system into straight Creek depending on rainfall at a site visit in February to r18 with earth resources staff keeps own environment group collected water samples from seepage emerging from midway down the spillway and from a pondage at the foot of the dam zinc levels were 12 to 21 times higher than the anzac 95% protection levels and copper was 9 to 50 times higher before roundup minerals can begin work on raising the dam wall to expand the tailings dam they will have to lower the water level and this is according to the EES by 3 meters over the 8 hectare dam surface area this water will go straight into straight Creek and to hambo River my questions are as follows one in the event of serious contamination of the in the last few weeks on the Walsh River in Queensland what measures has the East Gippsland Shire in consultation with escape zone water taken to develop an emergency management plan to provide a backup water supply for local farmers and the township of Swiss Creek which is only 30 kilometers downstream from the dam to will the substantial financial support the East Gippsland Shire Council has provided to round up minerals including the 40,000 MOU commitment and the 90 thousand dollar purchase of the Elbe Anambra school despite the council being cognizant of the serious environmental risks posed by this project exposed to the council to a legal and financial liability in the event of failure of the tailings dam and contamination of the timber River 3 did the East Gippsland Shire Council also contribute funds through an MoU with independence group the previous owner of the Stockman project and if so how much thank you thank you oh if I could ask out miss Nelson director community strategy to provide a response thank you in respect to all three questions the first question was around with and council the tiling Stan whether that 's requirement has been specifically addressed but at my in respect to financial support 40,000 mentioned Anambra school these are things that council has the MOU is something that council entity to some time ago as a positive approach to maximizing the benefits and in entering into an mo focused on things that are outside the normal remit of formal so focusing on things that are voluntary opponents in entering into an MOU it 's appropriate to commit some level of resource to actions and the MOU greed actions I know there has been some concern about fact that there is mention of this amount of money provided by both organizations and so the the wording in the MOU that 's presented today makes it very clear that both organizations manage their own funds it 's not so in respect to the MOU currently as proposed committing some results of a PC and we have never had asked my project owners there 's been as indicated in the report only very few actions taken because at the time that we were dealing with this prior of the actions in respect to the benamber primary school council was very open about the process with this school site because we identified it as providing the greatest potential benefit by having the transport interchange located in the town the the town the school has been purchased by Council because ultimately it is a community will be retained is to be leased to round out minerals and they will also be so these are actions that were flagged through the ESS okay putting this in place and these are actions that approved for use outside of environmental not it 's not linked to that we 're simply pursuing opportunities next question thank you the next question is from Joe Moulton he 's joining the gallery unfortunately the rules require that the questioner is in the gallery so I 'll table that question and we 'll respond to this Moulton separately the third and final question is from Lisa Roberts is Lisa in the gallery has she appointed you as her representative would you like to read the question or would you like me to do so okay thank you habitat Gippsland have representatives from the following groups Gippsland plains conservation management network east gippsland rain forest conservation management network gives land Environment Group lake tires post action Eagle Point Landcare coast care environment East Gippsland then sole urban land care group non gonna land care group Ben star jr. field naturalist friends are the Gippsland lakes East Gippsland wildlife rehabilitators in Victorian advocates for animals Friends of bats and bush care in the era of end friends of bats and habitat Gippsland represent over 200 concerned individual residents of East Gippsland supporting the current gray headed flying fox blue society an event style being protected and managed as a Conservation Reserve and the question is will this gives then Shire Council be undertaking consultation with friends of bats and habitat Gippsland as a way of moving forward once again our last miss Nelson to respond thank you yes we are aware of Friends of bats it keeps learning him the group when it was first to include them activities associated with the report presented today to council about this matter indicates that we do believe it 's appropriate while You Nelson there any further public questions now counselor Ellis what a question if I might to miss Bennett just to clarify for the community in relation to miss Mullins question unfortunately she was unable to make it here today but was able to drop the question to the camera can you explain to counsel why this that her question couldn 't be read particularly if it is as I believe associated with the Bates councils local laws prescribes the rules for one of a better term under which public questions can be posed and numbered two of those rules is the person named on the form is submitting the question must be in at the meeting or have a representative present and the reason for that of course is it 's appropriate a person has a question that is of sufficient important right and then the follow-through then I assume is that a full a detailed written response would be made to the person submitting the question which would be a public document any further questions thank you it 's been at item my one point eight point one recommendation move counselor Eve seconded counselor Ellis any questions all those in favor against miscarried thank you now item one point nine there 's been any petitions item two any notices of motion or rescissions any deferred business that brings us to item four counselor reports counselor would you like to start please Thank You mr. mayor I have been emailed my report to council offices and I did a couple of things last in the last month one of which I would like to speak up because it was something that excuse me I particularly enjoyed we did over a week ago excuse me was a planning consultation mediation session which was an opportunity for some some members of our community to oppose a proposal to Council to build a house on a property and the the resulting conversation that was had boiled those people with the with the proponents and the the outcome that come of that which was that they learnt quite a number of things about how our system works and I think come to a better understand of the situation that everybody faced in regards that everybody left that meeting of the understanding that they could move forward and actually point out some issues and hopefully get them addressed and come to a resolution that was that was suitable for everybody so that was something it was the first time I had had been to one of those consultation meeting though mediation meetings and I must say I found it very enjoyable so it certainly was a very interesting thing for me to do very much in Jordan thank you I might add counselor to you that was very well cared to so thank you for cheering that mediation um councillor Reeves thanks mayor good here you go good evening I 'm sorry used to doing this in the evening good afternoon everyone my report draws attention quickly to a visit recently by a Minister Joly Pulford and that was quite important for us in our area as she had a focus on draft matters she visited a number of properties in the Shire and also had a really useful Q&A with members of the community up at the Delap office afterwards just draw our home but in our Shire at cape conran owning the last couple of weeks which is most unseasonal and really does draw our attention to the fact that we are in drought conditions and amazingly at the same time we were head to avalanche warnings at Mount Hotham as there was a wildfire raging at cape conran which is something about their crazy weather conditions we have at the moment and lastly councillors many of us met with our colleagues at East Gippsland water for our regular MoU meeting and it 's a very useful an amicable relationship just as it should be and there 's a number of really useful and productive joint initiatives that of mutual benefit but even though it looks like an easy thing to do to have a meeting and mo-mo you like that any good relationship she requires constant care communication and good interaction just like any good contemporary relationship Thank You councillor Reeves counsel Roberts Thank You mr. mayor among other things I did in the month of September one of one thing I 'd like to mention was just this Sunday gone drone flying day organized by the buckin neighborhood house now what I thought was gonna be a pretty relaxed day of geeks flying help toy helicopters there was actually a representative from a club in Melbourne called Eastside fpv Club which they 're the largest if not the largest in the country if not the world competitive drone racing organization now they are home to Tomas be apart Tomas bit Mara who is a dual world champion only just turned 18 this year and was recently dubbed the Roger Federer of drone racing now drone racing is a really it 's a rapidly growing sport if you call it that loosely but it aims to engage kids in stem stem programs because these these drones often custom-built by their operators they 're not something you can go down a deep Smith or JB hi-fi I pick up off the shelf you 've got to build it yourself program it soldering there 's engineering involved and discussing with the the representative of East East Side was really great because they 're looking at potentially putting on a regional event adding it getting thrown around so potentially we could be getting water right large spectacle events from coming to East Gippsland shower so it was there a really positive meeting and we 've swapped details and yeah hopefully we 'll see something something coming forward Thank You councillor Roberts cancer Ellis Thank You mr. mayor my report is also being prepared previously prepared and has been forwarded to admin a couple of matters I 've just mentioned I represent counsel at the farewell for outgoing CEO Rob Spence in Melbourne recently Rob has provided local government we sterling service over many years and he will certainly be missed was a quite memorable gathering in company with council pelts we attended the Australian timber councils annual forum and conference in Melbourne the presentations will be made available to counsel us once they become available and circulate it one of the striking things for me that came out of that was the need for over a hundred thousand hectares helped acres of plantation timber just to maintain the industry aside from outside the other current political issues of native forest harvesting I also attended and disc and with those gentlemen discussed the future of the timber industry in our state and particularly our region that 's an accord a number of meetings I attended one I attended which had a strong impression upon myself was in company with other councillors attending Leben style community precinct all harbours is called now we 're and meeting with executive officer Jane ponting and her team at mrs. Pauling is a particularly capable person and is now providing excellent services to our community and I look forward to her ambitions for the future being a chair I will just not refer to the other meetings but there is one extra matter I sure would like to bring to councilors attention and it 's been prompted by councillor Buckley who is on suspension and that is counsel acknowledging the life of former tenant and a Shia counselor mr. Holly Stevenson Levinson served on the former shy for a period of 17 years and served two terms as president of that particular council I know that we 've previously acknowledged he 's passing but I would like to behalf of 's all I need to thank you so we need a full motion in relation to the condole mr. Muir with your students I would like to propose that council acknowledge the passing of walnut councillor Stevenson they matter be recorded in the minutes yeah and that 's being moved councils seconded counselor why all those in favor scary Thank You council why thank you mr. Muir and the one of the first things I speak about and that probably goes to reinforce what council Reeve said earlier about the the bush fire in Marlowe or in Kannan we had a shower emergency management meeting on the 9th of August and of course the focus was on how dry it was the fact that within about a week we will have fire restrictions remember and the discussion was about that and how dry the forest is etc and the fact that that in their prescribed burns this year Adele have actually only been out for 10 percent of their their work so in other words we have a very dense forest out there that 's very dry so we just but during the meeting of course there are many young health authorities and ambos etcetera at these meetings and the focus quickly turned to the drought and the effect on individuals what they may be going through so it 's there the consensus from that was that for everyone to please keep an eye on on local farmers just to say good eye or just to keep an eye on me their well-being at this stage so then also a very very informative conference which was the beef conference held cold in Ben style it also had a reference to the drought and it was focused on on feeding techniques and the quality of foods etc unfortunately these this type of conference would be well and truly booked in advance but it would have been very handy to all of us have gotten this information perhaps four or five months ago but that was still quite valuable and I for one have taken up quite a few of the lessons weren 't vote from that my own personal you know looking after my animals then of course as mentioned the 's yet to see the Omega the directors from their organization who have a diverse background so it was quite an amazing and then the other evening good evening it was a dinner down in Lakes Entrance put on by the local fishermen to showcase their wild catch and their passion and of course the restauranteur their passion for wanting to use this this local produce and showcase it to everybody so it was a particularly good evening enjoyed by all and there was quite a bit of discussion around certain things that are going on in the fishing industry at the moment and then lastly with regard to some of the funding that may be available to shires coming from the federal government what have we been tasked with trying to think of a good way that this could be used for drought affected areas and the the amount of money is not a great deal per her farm may be eligible but in discussed this with our local I 'd remember Darren Chester that oh I wondered if we could introduce something like a solar panel by or Shire and if if it was to be taken up and accepting either by the people that we would we would be also helping some of the businesses in the towns not not all of them of course by plumbers solar solar suppliers electricians and of course the council itself assure has our our one solar initiatives in prose in progress at the moment and in that I would like to perhaps get some discussion on this that we could could look along these lines and it would not be a great cash injection or for rural people but it would be something that would be ongoing for a long long time and serve them well and I also think environmentally it would put the shire in it you know perhaps at the leading edge of other other councils in in the country if we were to do something of this nature to be taken up thank you thank you councillor white so I 'd like to start off just highlight a couple of things out of my report the first one was the Gippsland small business festival just kicked 's guest speaker was Gus Bell Banton Gus was a former executive director and chief technologist at Lonely Planet and he shared some stories with the small business community of East Gippsland how he had to get Lonely Planet out of thinking that their travel books were going to be around forever which because our market leaders they thought that printed travel books would never go out of vogue and as we know the case is quite different so it was quite interesting to learn how he had to change the mindset of that powerful organization after being market leader for so long and had a transition into an electronic version of what they 'd been promoting the second one in relation to the thief event that councillor white mentioned it happens to be the biggest thief event in Victoria the organizers in conjunction with egg Victoria I had to cap the numbers because we don 't actually have a venue a suitable venue for holding those types of events so it 's whilst it 's good it 's also a challenge that if we want to grow events like of suitable venues also the gibster Awards were on during the month and we were well represented in East Gippsland we had Ashley Nichols for swimming at the age of 10 he 's already broken so many swim records I couldn 't remember them all but I think he 'll actually be someone that will see standing on the blocks at an Olympics I believe we had jack parrot track and field likes entrance we had Sydney churchmen equestrian and from band style Ashland Jones as we know is a great not only great at a sport but also a great young role model so she took out the the open gift star award which was fantastic another thing that really impressed me during the month was the East Gippsland United footy club under 15 girls fundraiser it was an incredible showcase of hospitality in particular customer service matched with fine dining I 'm not looking for a free handout this young well-disciplined w team assisted our internationally accredited local chef Rob Turner and they sister Robin preparing and serving an exceptional world-class meal and the money they raise from to the Australian football school international soccer tournament to be held in shepherding Rob Turner 's another identity that 's created a destination restaurant right here in Ben star the former yellow-belly deli is now being rebranded northern ground to showcase his heritage out of the UK and you can witness how popular our soccer game is here locally if you drive past out parking if Thursday night you can see the numbers of people they 're training so I think it 's watch this space and we 've certainly identified that in our strategic sporting master plan the other really exciting thing was the official opening of the after building the Australian fisheries management Authority a business which has been if you 're like decentralized at a Canberra and put to where the actual industry is so we 've had 13 well-paid professionals and our located that 's in the CMAC building at bulla Guyana Lakes Entrance the new office was an opportunity recognized the hard works gone into such a project and getting it to move from Canberra it just so happens that the lakes entrance port is off really well with the Gippsland Business Awards and I 'd like to give a big shout out for sailors grave brewing who took out the food and wine beer award which is a category that East Gippsland Shia sponsors so I was really happy to to give that to Gabi and Chris more sailors great brilliant brewing is a family business run by Gabi and Chris it 's an independent brewery in all of us the businesses join enjoying significant growth due to the hard work and determination by the owners it has distribution in seven states and it 's another great example of thinking locally acting globally Gabi and Chris say the people places and the produce that make their beers are the strength behind their brand and the lifeblood of their product they aim to strengthen their tears to the region and obviously continue to promote or boss down East Gippsland through their locally inspired beer thank you item 5.1.1 is officers report and new fees and charges on mobile stage and outdoor cinema and we have used the wine Richards in attendance Thank You mr. mayor on management responsibilities from mobile stage the intent being to hire this out and we think there be some significant community benefit from this to do this requires fees and charges so we 've developed some fees and charges the philosophy or the reasoning behind those fees are included in the report and so these fees are presented for endorsement to publicly advertise with the intent to bring this back for adoption following the feedback period questions councils counselor Ellis Thank You mr. mayor I 'll keep my question short can you tell us about the agreement that councils entered into what what does it entail in relation essentially it 's it 's as if council owned the only mobile station equipment so includes responsibility for storage maintenance operation of it etc there is a lease fee for this which was essentially 5% of the of the total cost of the stage totals are the total cost of the stage and equipment is the total values around about 170,000 that was about six nine thousand annual fee for two years and who do we pay this to and how did that the payment is to essentially the gentleman that organized so Dobson 's Allison from douse ins the intent my understanding of my intent from the discussion with mr. Dobson is that that fee will be donated back to the community so it 's not for profit for mr. Dobson I recently read in an article episode of council the details of this stage and stating that 184,000 includes two generators a hundred chairs or two gazebos and ancillary equipment what responsibility does counsel have for the maintenance and and use and care of these particular assets as mentioned council will manage it as if it I know so all responsibilities for the management and maintenance of those will see the council thanks mr. Muir I look forward to this matter coming back as per the emotion before council any other questions there is a recommendation before his councils we have a mover recommendation leave council Robert second counselor tui speakers for the motion Thank You counsel I 'd like to I 've been contacted by quite a few community groups over some time regarding the need for a facility hear the concern in councillor Ellison 's voice but I think overall I think this could be a beneficial asset for council to have and provide a medium for the arts and performance especially now more regional centres I think if management correctly this could be really valuable Thank You councillor it 's second that would you like to it council to you Thank You mr. mayor I 'd concur with councillor Roberts and I think this will be a great asset for our outlying communities speakers against councillor else know this matters going out for public consultation service foolish to speak against it mr. mee but what I am raising is my concern as to the cost of the facility if it 's to be an asset for the assistance of our small community groups I 'm also concerned about the burden that will be placed on council officers I note that we have a new a new unit called the community programs unit to address these so I look forward to a further and more in-depth conversation in relation to councils role in taking on such assets that we 'll as council Robert solutes will be a great benefit to the wide community of these Gippsland but we 'll wait and see hopefully my comments might create interests in the community and will get some positive or negative feedback whatever the case may be thank you so any further speakers for the motion Council Reeves thanks mr. Muir and thanks for raising the matters cancer Ellis economics 101 says that you can 't cut your way to success that we have to invest in our community have to invest socially financially by mentally emotionally the great thing about this is that we haven 't made the capital outlay it 's been a donation a generous donation and the whole community celebrates that I 'm looking forward to hearing the feedback from the community about the schedule of share fees and charges and then if they 're accepted it 's worth being used to its maximum Thanks councillor Reeves any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor of the motion against it 's carried unanimously thank you Oh Adam five point one point two it thank you Thank You mr. mayor again capsule would be aware that their council is responsible for a significant amount of supporting infrastructure across across the region development of this and management of this needs to be done in a strategic manner with the long term vision this plan has been developed and provides that vision and strategy around the sporting facilities in being sterile it 's worth noting that the plan was developed with significant community consultations there was over 100 clubs consulted in the development of the plan it was also pulled out for consultation following finalization and that draft plan received some 54 submissions and what a number of those we 're positive and there 's some really good feedback from those submissions the wear amendments made based on those submissions which are detailed in the report but it 's now presented for adoption Thank You mr. Richards questions from councillors councils do you have a question no thanks mr. mayor I 've already raised my comment in relation to missing of motor sports clubs in this study and I accept the explanation for Richards they are any further questions we have a recommendation before us do we have a mover for the recommendation move council robert ii at counselor Ellis your speakers counselor Ellis did you want to speak to there 's very little to say this is a positive step forward for the sporting infrastructure of our fire shower running particular the city of Bend style I look forward to its implementation Thank You counselor Ellis any further speakers put the motion all those in favor of the motion against scare unanimously thank you our item 5.1 point three is the World Health Organization global network of age-friendly cities and communities again mr. Richards thank you Thank You mr. mayor McGinn councillors would be aware that we 've been doing a significant amount of work and the age-friendly space in recognition of this good work but also that far life councils commitment to our 18 community we 're looking to a fire to join the World Health Organization global network age-friendly cities and communities the details of this application are within the report but essentially there 's no cost to council provides access to a to to Council and so essentially you 're seeking endorsement this application questions councillors have a recommendation before his councilors maneuver counselor Ellis second to council watt speakers briefly this is this they one small step in terms of council addressing its aging community and its responsibilities it 's been a matter for me for a number of years to create policy within council to address the demands of an aging population in a Skip 's land the statistics show that we need to be forward-thinking and being part of a global network that will provide data and and advice along the way is one of those small steps to ensure that we address our community 's needs thank you thank you Cancer Council what did you end your comments yes I 'd like the problem they say the same and in that from this data that because of the changing age groups we have coming to this area that it then may put us in a in a position where we can attract for the business and funding to this area to support that group thank you thanks council you item 5.2.1 is implementation of vegetation management plan gray headed flying fox colony which were to walk band style and we have miss Nelson director community strategy thank you to cut it earlier in the meeting council he 's being asked today to consider so I counsel it 'll be aware that we have management one of perhaps one of the busiest over many years we 've say that the impact of that break education today gross actually council has sought and has to remove popplers are on this last you know we need that permission so we have that approval and we have removed vegetation and more recently found ourselves taking further further vegetation corridor that 's primarily because the the conditions that we need to meet by challenging because we are not to negatively impact on the bats and their presence throughout the year makes that the same time as having received permission under the Commonwealth legislation we also have sought independent advice about the risk associated with some of the trees out of the river corridor and we are aware and have advice that some of in the absence of being able to undertake any specific tree management works to reduce that risk the report presented today outlined some options that we will get to undertake to reduce that risk without being able to undertake tree removal or d waiting on trees and the recommendation is to close a section of the mitchell river walking track just east of the dog hold lead through to where there 's a little straight with the proposition that for now we redirect people out to River Green Street up along on to the shed pathway and back onto the track longer-term there is a need as I indicated earlier for counsel to understand how we do manage this section of vegetation and our role in that and so the recommendation is that further report should come back to to Council but for now the recommendation of offices is that we do need to act given there is there there is an alternative at the moment for people to be directed around the the colony and that we need to close the track and communicate the rationale we have spoken user which is the park run operation that happens and and they understand the rationale and relocate the course way so there will be if council agrees with the recommendation today but it would be action thank you thank you Elson questions council council robots Thank You mr. mayor um miss Nelson as the bats have been identified as dead oh sorry as that as the trees have been identified as dangerous for some time now it was time now what was the trigger that resulted in this motion coming for fall Council and why wasn 't it considered earlier well we 've known about the trees being dangerous for a little while since the reporter came in and the past two years we have had potential opportunity so we 've monitored them it 's not a prediction that a tree will fall in a particular time so our arborists have been involved in monitoring those trees but given some of them were were assessed as having fairly imminent potential to impact on users then we felt that in circumstances to take a proactive approach in case of having been point where we haven 't been able to do the work we don 't know when we will be able to do get in there and do anything yet follow-up question cancer look I think that 's that 's an example of something that has changed since when since we submitted our application to the Commonwealth the actual process of gaining the approval took around about four years it was a very long detailed process and the reality is that very soon after we gained our approval we actually had something like 60,000 baths inhabit the area so there 's been substantial sheets the length of time that they 're staying it is the case that the conditions on our permit now currently make it very difficult for place even to undertake work to meet our conditions approval and so I think there is an opportunity there needs to be an opportunity created to review the circumstances I 'm also aware that the Commonwealth Government has freed up opportunities for councils to manage vegetation well and so in some cases it may be that that it 's easier to undertake permit so there 's been a number of things change and that 's one suggesting that you know we need to the council has always taken the view that the balance we 're trying to seek is managing the risk to users but also to so we 've taken a very risk-averse approach to these quite a number of occasions because it 's just not appropriate to do that but at the same time be sensible about the fact that there are a large number so yes I agree there a number of things number of circumstances that have changed Council finds itself between a rock and a hard place really trying to manage that balance between so the intention would be to report back to Council at an appropriate time to understand what the future it canceled raves that a question and then council wide had a question thanks mr. mayor mr. Nelson so you 've just alluded to what I was going to ask about that is in the recommendation point five about a report and undertake undertaking a report in review you have a sense of a might just take a little while to work through what all the options are even changes to the permissions that are actually required under the Commonwealth legislation into the future permit is current until 2021 and understanding what that means whether we will actually be able to counsel might be exposed to we 're also part of a CSIRO University of Melbourne research project that is designed to assist councils to make good judgments about how to deal with the interaction between colonies urban environments and so I 'd like to say so that we can he 's cancer he was kesswood he 's mr. Viet I miss Nelson the the the the the site visit that we undertook recently I 'm not an arborist but is it possible to keep the track open by just removing the offending overhanging branches and not the entire trees because that would probably suit the the bat colony and would also suit the people who like to use that River Walk there is currently no ability to go in and undertake works in and around the colony under any we don 't have our Commonwealth permit because we 're prevented from doing works from July because there 's too great a risk to the colony and and the bats are pregnant we would also need permission from the Victorian government under the Wildlife Act to do to disrupt them so no there 's not the ability to go in and do any work at all the work that we were planning to do earlier this all in July anyway it was removal of some trees and trimming of some trees and we don 't have effectively don 't have permission to do so in the view of officers the the best option for council is to seek to close the track the intention and part of a part of our proven requires us to construct an alternative access from the river track up to river ends so closer to the colony our aim would be ultimately to be able to do that work it 's designed and budgeted for but we just need to have the right conditions so that we can undertake the work if we can do that bit of work for users and I think that 's part of part of the consideration that council needs to and we men thanks miss Nelson cancer all that send cancer cells thanks mr. mayor okay do you think there 's a potential for council to hand responsibility to another government body with more specific resourcing and experience around wildlife management no I think that 's an interesting question only because I don 't know that there are any there in a very few situations where people manage wildlife and I need to always emphasize we 're not managing the line and I think part of the consideration that will document for councils is for council is the reality is this is also a heavily used recreation facility so now we 're looking at managing vegetation we 're not managing the bats we 're not pretending that corridor but we do manage that piece that 's that 's part of the thinking process counselor else thanks mr. mayor I 'm taking on board Cates responses to cancel the Reeves and cancer robots despite our questions because it is a complex matter and and not only ecological strengths but it also has you know a high heritage meaning too many people in the city of been still there the track to reaching to the port of been star and that leads me to my my question and I think that we probably need to be a bit more definitive okay we 're there reporting back on this and rather than saying perhaps three or four months or whatever if we as a council could ask for a the report that 's coming back to have a time frame perhaps to the December meeting so is that possible this the first one could could we have that report to come to the ordinary meeting in December that would allow three months I think which is reasonable and if I can just respond I 'm assuming that will be possible part of the reason why I hadn 't put a date on it is because not all of the information from the research project and the reality is we 're not going to be doing any work into next year so council doesn 't have to are with that full information good thanks for that night I take that on board but as members of the public as a member of the public I would want to know and like what sort of time frame is there when can I go back to walking on my track that I 've walked on for the last five years so those sort of questions and the right to the and you 've also answered the report the cooperative work between the research groups again that would have great weight and influence on any sort of future decision so I look forward to hearing that report coming in and OSH and I take it that we may know something by December as well so any further questions councillor he 's moving the recommendation of a seconder significant council Reeves any speakers council to eat Thank You mr. may I I 'm happy to recommend this to councillors it is a complex issue as counselor Ellis referred but it does require an immediate action in order to to ensure the safety of users of that track it 's potentially medium-term get sooner rather than later you know we can take some definitive action to allow us to deal with the issue and hopefully keep both things and have both things happen in currently Council are you happy to add another dot point about the report coming back in December for a status update I welcome dr. cheeks in that manner any further speakers all those in favor against we do odd in my 4.2.2 it 's a proposal to end section 173 agreement af8 double 1 double 1 0 G as it relates to PC 3 7 double 5 1 3 4 green court eagle point mr. Holly Thank You mr. mayor councils you will recall that this has come before council previously and receiving principal support this is a report in front of Council today seeking to end the agreement and that is the officers recommendation councils in short this parent property was provided with the planning permit to develop it with 4 townhouses they weren 't immediately built a subsequent subdivision of the land was applied for to be consistent with that for unit development the subdivision permit that were created to be consistent with the development permit for clearly good planning purposes councils a land owner or for Green Court has purchased the property they have consolidated two of the lots that were previously approved and they have no intention to proceed with the development that was approved in 2004 councillors we believe that this makes good planning sense to end the agreement as the lot will be able to be developed more in accordance with the plan expands in our stance so be consistent with the current flooding levels of today it will allow for the garden space as required under the general residential zone of today and should the dwelling be constructed above 7.5 metres or be greater than 300 square metres it will need to get a planning permit that would be consistent with the design development over like schedule 14 for Eagle Point on that on that basis council there 's a recommendation to seek to in the agreement thank you now you mr. hi any questions from counselors we have a recommendation before us over mover move counselor to e of a motion all those in favor against its Kerry Thank You mr. Howlett item my five point two point three is the capital works and landfill rehabilitation projects status quarterly report or quarter report for 2017-18 is Weigel thank you sorry mr. counsellors would be familiar with the quarterly reports that come on the capital works program and the landfill program on a quarterly basis for the first three quarters first time we 've provided a chordally report for the fourth quarter not only this information is tied up and held within the annual report however we thought that it was a good choice I present this report as a stand-alone report to give an overview of the year that 's been and how the capital program has performed overall we had a about 177 programs in the in the capital program for the year as councillors one night there was a budget of about 45 million dollars of which 27 nearly 28 million dollars was spent and a further 13 point six five million dollars was committed by a contractor within the program the report is part of also provides of each of the projects and one gives you a bit of a breakdown it shows well how the program was delivered by place I 'm happy to take any questions on that thank you for that any questions from councils is the recommendation before us Council yes counselor else it 's a very simple one and I have read briefing sheet and I 've just forgotten how many of those projects would have had to have come before council for approval and in in that financial year can you give me a rough idea we 've recently been quoted in the press as counsel for the core of being the most secretive council in the state and yet this report is showing a large capital expenditure of four do you know of many millions of dollars for these capital works projects perhaps mr. White 's might be able to help me with that because the East or the projects would have become in camera yeah thanks good question counselor else mr. White 's thank you cancer Ellis any projects that see construction projects the requirement of to 250,000 dollars on average when you look at the last year meaning probably two to four contracts per meeting was that fifty for the year potentially out of 180 projects look thanks for that so we 're looking at something around about the high let 's be generous and say in the high 30s to the low 40s and that 's something that needs to come in to to maintain confident commercial in confidence and it 's these sorts of reports give people a clearer clearer vision of the actual works of council undertakes in the operational budgets but I understand yeah no it 's good question counselor else who 's they the article referred to close meetings and in fact our agenda items at an open meeting any further questions on that yep council Reeves question is around combining capital works and landfill rehabilitation now I 've been counseled for my second term but we combine the two separate matters we have had some adverse reporting also around landfill matters and reporting on land that 's another concern not related not none of the story but it 's not all the combine at least if I 'm the to council race because the words that are within this report are pretty much construction projects our waste real rehabilitation projects can 't actually be considered from a financial accounting point of view as a capital project operating budget but because they capital in nature they 're a large construction project we look for it 's any further questions it 's not we do have that recommendation we have a move move counselor Ellis got a second counselor Reeves the speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you is what item my five point three point one is the decision of Victorian Civil Administrative Tribunal counselor Pierce Edward Buckley versus counselor conduct panel Muse Bennett counselors this report has its genesis in the Local Government Act is so much of what does under the Local Government Act Wiener Council of Conduct panel is convened and hands down finding we are required to report that to the next council meeting similarly when that decision is appealed we are required to thank you Miss Bennet questions from wind here hypothetically so this is there 's a recommendation from VCAT to suspend councillor Buckley does that mean that technically the council does not have to follow that recommendation it 's not actually a recommendation so apart from noting it is there why does it need to come before council or is that a statutory obligation he 's indeed required by the Local Government Act further questions of the recommendation 411 mover moved council roofs second counselor to e we put the motion all those in favor against was carried unanimously thank you either my five point three point two is a review of council policies and this one was the risk management policy miss Bennett thank you councilors this report is the latest in the rolling report refreshment that we do in this case we 're referring to the risk management policy the policy has been referred to and which was in agreement with the recommendations and the content of the documentation before you now so the recommendation sex your adoption of the policy thank you Miss Bennett any questions from councillors we do have that recommendation never counselor Ellis city councilors have the urge to speak to that oh therefore put the motion all those in favor against the motions carried thank you item five point three point three is our investment policy review for 2018 miss Collins in attendance thank you Miss Collins Thank You mr. mayor annual any council reviews its investment policy and we 've undertaken a review of the former policy and there 's only been some minor amendments that have been made to the existing policy the one that 's presented for councils consideration today so I 'm happy to take any questions Thank You mr. mayor thank you these Collins questions councillors another recommendation forest counselors like to move that recommendation councillor Reeves we have a seconder council why any speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carried thank you so item my five point three point four is a capital discretionary fund allocations for twenty eighteen nineteen and in attendance we have mr. Richards Thank You mr. Richards that was on before council is the capital discretionary funds an annual allocation for smaller projects that allocation are provided there 's an there is a budget of 200,000 so if identified projects totaling 145,000 leaving fifty five thousand for any unforeseen projects that come up later through the year so the recommendation is recommended projects solicited for adoption Thank You mr. Richards is there any questions for mr. Richards from counselors if not we have a recommendation moved councillor Reeves second that councillor Roberts counselor is happy to speak to this one the previous policy in this are not unrelated good investment carriage and management of our money allows us to invest in our communities and these small investments a long way we know that 1 spent can have a multiplier effect four or five six times in our small communities and this is this is great as I said earlier can 't cut your way it 's a prosperity you have to invest your way to success and this is a great opportunity to do it well done counsel Thank You councillor Ruiz council Roberts did you on it speak any further speak wish I mean that 's a bit hard to follow councillor reason I 'm speaking for the mayor and what I 'm saying is that this is another one of those I 've lost my language yeah what I was going to say this is another one of the funding strengths that council provides to its community which is of great importance it needs the stream that hasn 't been reviewed it along for a long time and in fact the total bucket it 's remained constant for probably two terms that I 'm aware of so I will look forward to discussing perhaps an increase for these community funds into the next budgeting process that 'll commence later in the year and early next year that 's a good point counselor I was very good point would any councils like to make that part of this motion that we review that increases yeah mover in second to happy with that we might have to keep the director in this chair about longer than that if there 's no further speakers I 'll put that motion with that addition all those in favor against that 's carried unanimously thank you so item Understanding between East Gippsland Shire Council and round oak minerals proprietor limited stop mine Stockman mine project benamber mr. Ellison yes this is our report presents to counselor advised MOU which has been something that council entered into back in 2012 when there was first discussions about the mine project being progressed our municipality it was it was an early step at the time that council talked and seen is quite a proactive step focusing on things that we believe were important to the community which weren 't necessarily it 's a voluntary agreement so it 's a document that has been worked on by officers we around representatives of round out minerals the the MOU that 's presented today you 'll see from the markup version is substantially based on but has been edited to the fact that the mon has actually changed so while counsel did counsel did originally formally resolved to continue to keep the MOU live but understand what at that time more recently the met the mine project has been divested and is now owned by roundels and they are actively progressed the mine and understanding what this is about is really about council being proactive and working jointly with the the proponents to make sure that we maximize opportunities project like you smell some questions counselor Ellis this is only a clarification point and mr. Nelson on actually did referred to it in during the question time earlier and that is that questions been raised in the community about what is the 40,000 that councils going to kind of contribute to the MOU and and the second part of the question would be what would what would be some examples of the monies being spent you know what sort of projects would that money be spent on thanks cancellous it 's pretty normal with an MOU something where we 're agreeing on joint actions that you actually have the resources to act on otherwise there 's no that the things that you intend to implement so you 'll notice in the MOU document it 's not all about resourcing it but there is an amount mentioned up to forty thousand dollars from each organization and some of those actions include initiatives to look at necessarily part of councils strategic planning work plan but where there is a need to understand how do we how do we support investment in appropriate housing to support population growth that might be experienced that has a longer term use or valuable purpose how can it be used how can we make sure that not all of the rental housing that would normally be available being consumed by people working in the mind how do we deal with those housing issues so that that 's one example and there 's a number of examples other projects or actions in there not all of them will require funds and we 're not suggesting that they be allocated necessarily as a as anything outside of the current budget because a lot of this is really really the criteria of business as usual for parts of the organization but it 's there demonstrating a commitment by both organizations to to actually implement council Rohit 's Thank You mr. mayor I 'm regard to what the point that just did the deed brought up regarding the 40,000 they put putting towards joint co-contribution water and I don 't recall there being a contribution that kind of amount in most of those most of the things in the MOU those get some water are things that are business illusion that organization would have responsibility to commit to what we 're looking at here is working proactively with the commercial entity and asking them to contribute to things that benefit the community and place them in good stead it 's a clear we 're looking for a clear commitment that both organizations two public organizations kettle of fish but certainly the in the case of eschaton water and biscuits and Shire it 's the CEOs yeah I think I 'm running and saying that this year 's MOU will identify some renewable energy projects and waste projects that we could potentially work up into capital type projects that would come back to the individual organizations for further consideration so there 's there 's a undertaking given by edge organization here it 's more explicit and I think it 's I appreciate that there there has been some concern about how that would operate and so fun although the the actions would be jointly agreed to and the priorities will need to be we may not spend 40,000 so it 's an up-to-the-minute thank you there 's now saying further questions of a recommendation before us councils Good Counsel Reeves of a second Council to e speakers I 'm happy to talk to this we 've seen this MOU in its previous form and I think it 's good to revisit it with the new ownership the new proposal just to again remind ourselves that we 're not the approval agency so we don 't determine whether this goes ahead or not we 're not their board members we don 't determine whether it 's a financial benefit but one thing I do say is that it 's a bit of like a Chinese proverb of Chinese business that you you only do business with your friends and you wouldn 't do anything to upset your friends and so to have an MoU with a large potential investor it 's less likelihood that they 'll do anything untoward to Shire and they 're more likely to be socially economically environmentally and so to have that close working relationship is really really important as I said you you never do anything that would be untoward towards your friends so to set up an MoU like this he 's about developing a close working relationship relationship and friendship in that will only be beneficial for everyone and I think that that should reassure the likes of our questioners today who asked those those open questions that while we don 't have direct ability to influence environmental decisions we can actually work with that organization to ensure that they do make the right decisions because they wouldn 't want to hurt us speakers against the motion Thank You mr. mayor while I appreciate the sentiment civ of councillor Reeves I believe a lot of resources have already been committed to this project to help improve the relationship between these Gippsland Shire and round outs minerals the benamber school site as one they 're quite a a good lease arrangement I think at a time when you 're seeing such a severe drought that we are and farmers that are be contributed more bit better in other areas considering the commercial entity receives a lot of resources from other areas and they 're not doing hard in this respect thank you Thank You councillor Roberts just respond to that within the looking speakers oh yes yeah he 's speaking in yeah you 're gonna be right of reporting and I would just like to say quite beneficial to have had wines presentation prior to this looking at the community grants that we have and the fact that we 've now promotion forward to we look at increasing that and I 've feel like councillor Robertson you know 40,000 investment in such a small place in the Shire I think is to me just a little bit extreme when the restoration is having such a small amount thank you Thank You councillor speakers for the motion yep counselor Ellis Thank You mr. Maron I just want to support the council Reeves word saying and the actions as outlined in there in the report presented to Council today the monies and the actions are really important for the well-being of not just behaviors so in as exhibiting these mi use are critical for taking the full advantage of any economic benefit Lee a newcomers of their region can offer this is a well thought-out_,_5734.64 document and the 40,000 can only add to the benefit of the wide wider community and not just a small area I commend the the recommendation and and the report Thank You councils any speakers against further speakers movers has got the right of reply counsel Reeves councillors who have spoken against that I owed you to just rethink what you 've just said in terms of gratuities to farmers in drought forty thousand dollars to body by your couple of truckloads of feed forty thousand dollars invested as we 've spoken many times today will be reinvested four or five or six times over if it 's invested well throughout also we 've heard those of us who were there with Minister Paul for the other day and heard the farmers who are suffering are calling for the likes of opportunities for off farm employment to supplement their farm and those farmers who around the table will to invest in that off farm opportunities from work in the omiyo region where they are struggling 40,000 is not a huge amount and a lot of that is also councillors stop and read the report in kind so that 's the sort of work that we can actually contribute to some of the investment with our council officers do advocating helping around whatever projects there are that might come out of this and they are detailed in the report also mentions that that in in the agreement that the proponents around ugh we 'll set up a hundred and fifty thousand dollar community fund so many times more than our investment so again councils just stop and think what you 're doing you don 't actually do anything to hurt the people who are your friends and this is a an olive branch in a way of keeping those people that organization in the tent and if you are thinking that forty thousand dollars is a bad investment for potentially two hundred jobs then stop and have a long hard look at yourselves okay oh now put the motion two years brings us to item six urgent and other business any councils have any urgent or other business um I would just like to raise in in this spot that councillor Robertson and myself have requested an update on the EPA notification breach in fine and just wanted to confirm that 's coming to an expiration thank you we have item seven which is the confidential business just need that motion counselors yes please no not yet right I think I 'm reading the right when they might ask that counsel now close the public in accordance with the terms and provisions of section 89 subsection 2 of the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item 7.1 27.4 as these items relate to contractual matters smooth counselor Ellis seconded councillor Reeves all those in favor against this carried unanimously thank you _"

item my 1.7 is public mayor thank you item one point eight point one is the record of Assemblies of councillors and we have a list there and there 's also recommendation councillors said moved councillor I Connell seconded councillor pearls there any questions councillors if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor against s carry thank you item one point nine point one is perdition 's requesting council to declare a dog-friendly beach area in mallacoota it 's been a council this this is some statutory report in that in compliance with our meeting procedures local law when we receive a petition were required to table that at the next possible council meeting in this case this council meeting there were time didn 't exist to have a substantive report prepared so as the report indicates that report will come forward to the meeting so it 's there for your consideration just to thank you Miss Bennett the question and no questions questions counsel pills I just like to ask with regards to the reports or becoming another timeframe thank you for the questions counselor pelts there are a number of bring back to council a a change to the way in which we manage dog lead and adult on leash areas currently the whole municipality is declared a dog on leash area with two areas exceptions under consideration one in Bosworth Road in style and another in Parma strode Lakes Entrance we intend to bring a report to the September meeting seeking Council 's approval to declare those two sites specifically don 't both lead concurrent with that process we will be preparing a report to come to Council to declare the entire municipality dog off lead but identifying specific areas within the municipality that will be dog on lead in order to do that we believe we will be required to good best practice to consult with the community moving forward with that and we will in in the coming weeks establish a community reference group to to float those ideas and then prepare a report to come back to Council for consideration that could take some time to get that final report so I would imagine that within a 12 month period we may see the broader change the on the basis that areas where it is important that dog be restrained would be identified but other areas that are located outside of the municipal boundaries would people would be free to have their dogs off the leave should they choose to and where they would do now so we would see that broader amendment board change within 12 months but the two dogs off leash areas one in Lakes Entrance with one in bends up we will attempt to resolve Thank You councillor pearls that there 's a recommendation before his councillors move to councillor pearls seconded counselor Ellis these speakers this is the dog off leash something that we 've been asking for for quite some time so we thank the group of mallacoota too for their petition to see such support of six hundred odd signatories and it 's just a reflection of one is coming through our community people are coming here and staying there are elderly and now their children are their dogs basically and they really adore them and it 's great that we can actually accommodate them in a couple of do the policy work and look into the background of what is required for having dog off leash areas in our whole community so there 'll be things like dog on leash areas in the streets in the main town centers and in responsible dog ownership basically and basically we 'll be looking at the opportunities that we can give to them so we look forward to this reporting and hope that it comes through thank you Thank You councillor pearls counselor Ellis Marwood to corroborate the mover of this nation and simply say thanks to the members of our community that the petition counts in relation to this matter it is a mat has been recognized by council for quite some time and officers in cooperation with counselors have been working to identify the best manner in which to meet the demands of dog the dogs off leash issue and subsequently I look forward to final reports and actions coming back before council into course thank you thank you counselor Ellis is there any further speakers if not all put the motion all those in favor against its carried 2 2018 these EPS land show become a refugee welcome zone counselor Ellis Thank You mr. mayor and councillors for this opportunity to present this motion toward before council can I draw your attention to page 8 of this evenings agenda and ask you to follow me through as I put the particular recommendation to Council and then provide you with the rationale i 've request that council declare East Gippsland Shire Council or refugee zone and to acknowledges that this declaration is a commitment in spirit to welcoming refugees into our community upholding the human rights of refugees demonstrating compassion for Refugees and enhancing cultural and religious diversity in our community there 's strong rationale which I 'll draw your attention to in the accompanying documents mr. mayor I 'm happy to read it verbally out or if your councils are happy young quite prepared just to say a few words I think most councils would have read that yes if you just like to say a few words okay thank you for that indulgence mr. mayor the issue of refugees in this country is topical I do appreciate community members who have formed an organization within the Big East Gippsland community to take care and welcome refugees into our community I am aware of at least 12 refugee families residing in the city of been style at the present time the rationale will show that there is no binding commitment or anything Deedle dole or Terrace to the well-being and the shara biscuits then by adopting this welcome zone concept like I 've had the fortune to meet a number of these people over the course of years as a counselor and have noted the beneficial things that they bring to our community resulting ly to keep things moving there I recommend a recommendation to council Thank You councillor Ellis who have a seconder for the motion count councillor polls speak say I 'm delighted to be able to support counselor Ellis in its motion we are a diverse region we 're very accepting refugees have skills that we actually need and require they 're looking for a better life and they could do no they could go no further than coming to East keeps me and enjoying to have them the bottom line is we are a community of as it says here we are a community that was based on on refugees basically and they 've got terrible backgrounds and stories to tell the bottom line is they can come to our region and enjoy a much like to encourage all counselors to support Kapler Ellis in this no-brainer motion thank you thanks counselor pearls any speakers against the motion council by car water the question more than anything yeah I did this reflect anyway in the refugees that have stuck up in and you yeah you know with a menace island or how do we get on about that in this recommendation because that the federal government has said that no way are they going to come here is there any way we can put a clause in here somewhere to suggest that we 'd be a little bit more compassionate and in in that matter Thank You mr. mayor Thank You councillor Buckley did you would you would you like me to reply on yes counselor I think this statement and this application is refugees that have been recognized by the federal government if I have compassion for the people that are stuck on Manus Island but I don 't believe this applicator this motion before council relates to that particular action this welcomes people that have already been identified and been through the processes that the wider country have adopted to allow people into our country the men Asylum and Reserve I 'm sure matter for our federal government and perhaps for our local Federal Minister mr. Chester rather than for this chamber Thank You counselor Ellis there any further speakers councillor Reeves thanks mr. mayor council Alice I just want to commend you for bringing this notice of motion to the chamber it 's it 's a great thing that you 've done I 'm very grateful for you doing it and I think I 'm almost humbled by the words that you 've said it 's really very very powerful many of us know the second verse of our national anthem is for those who have sailed across the sea we 've boundless Plains to share and I think that he that underpins the spirit of generosity in the need to open our hearts and our communities to those refugees they 're refugees for a reason because they 're fleeing war famine devastation and we are a country of of wealth and generosity and open hearts and great values and I think that this is really very very important and highly symbolic and counselors I think we should all applaud counselor Ellis for bringing this to us and absolutely Riz and Lee supported Thank You counsel Reeves any further speakers but just like to make a couple of comments counsel Alice again just supporting what council Reeve said we did actually see this working very very well in the tomb of the Regional Council when we visited there last year where they were not only a welcomed region for refugees but also their state actually supported them with services to actually take it to the next level and I was keen to know whether you 'd be prepared to prosecute what we 've going to pass here tonight can be pre-emptive enough to suggest that whether you take that through jail can gets more supportive services in the region to make this more than just a mere gesture well thank you for those words mr. Muir the the note of the the state government do these are providing us with that sorts of assistance in in some various programs we are not the first Council to become we have put forward the concept of a refugee welcome zone there are other partner councils including Bob Orr from the top of my head who are already met in classified as that situation I 'm happy to support that through the GL GN and put it to the other councils hoping that they still have the same view as council has exhibited today thank you Thank You councillor Ellis if there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carried unanimously thank you councils item 3 any deferred business mr. CEO no deferred business mr. mayor item 4 is councillor reports councillor to e Thank You mr. mayor I actually council O 'Connell thanks mr. mayor I 'll just touch on a couple of things my 's been quite a busy July so I 'll just touch on a couple of things the economic development advisory board met and it was great to welcome our new board member Ross Paz ilaqua Ross has a very strong background in economic development and tourism having previously served on tourism northeast board and Parks Victoria and is also currently on the East Gippsland water board so we look forward to having his knowledge and expertise with us I attended a community reference group meeting on the stockmen mine which was held on the same day it was announced that the round minerals were granted and infrastructure mining license this will bring project one step closer and shoot everything go to plan we 're hoping to see construction late 2019 early 2020 and this will be a great economic boost for the whole region and not only economically but socially as well bringing in hopefully and a population influx I attended the fourth annual M&D business support luncheon where we heard from a range of guest speakers from politics through to football everyone gathering in aid of raising awareness and day an option was also held and 2600 was presented directly to the chair of our district health in support of MMD but perhaps the most exciting news we had this month was the announcement of the only a mountain bike project receiving one and a half million dollars from the building better regions fund and this was actually the only project from the whole of Gippsland to receive funding from that building better regions this project will transform our region create jobs drive economic growth and build a stronger community lastly I attended the regional telecommunications review consultation last week in burnstow which was very well attended by a range of people from all over the Shire this review was held nationally and it was actually a second last meeting to be held they were off to Hamilton in the afternoon but the chair of the committee commended everyone that attended and actually said that the amount of participants who were at that meeting had far exceeded any other meeting that they had attended so it was probably a testament to the amount of issues that East Gippsland faced look forward to the recommendations that the panel will make back to the government and hope to see change Thank You councillor O 'Connell councillor Reeves thanks mr. mayor mayor good evening councillors officers and guests in the gallery it 's nice that you 're here my report has been submitted but I 'll just draw out two matters that I 'd be really keen to highlight one was NAIDOC week and the flag-raising ceremony at the start of last month which was really well attended back here our back then and and it 's really an important event given the rich indigenous history and the large number of people who identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who live in our community and I was delighted to be there with so many others and the other matter I 'm going to draw out is today I facilitated for their gellan there gives their least local learning and employment network their fourth I think was the fourth maybe even the fifth inspiring young men 's event now I 'm probably neither inspiring nor young so I just had the job young men on their journey in the next stage and the real focus of that event is around helping those young men focus their attention and their next stage of their journey whether it 's past compulsory education into post compulsory education or work or a vocation or a trade and having some great mentors around them to wrap around them and I really commend the work of the Lyne you know it 's a bit of an unsung hero in our community that gives their least local learning and employment network it 's an aggregator of business and education providers and it just beavers away very quietly and very effectively so to Don and the team at the gallon I 've take my hat off to them and I 'm always happy to support that event and and thank you to those men who donated their time and there were students from all boss Lakes Entrance been style and Nagel there today about 35 students young men good on them that 's enough for me Thank You councillor ease council Buckley thank you mister me on last Saturday I was between Swiss creaking I mean I affectionately known as boh yep and see what the scoreboard was rather difficulty that it was at one of those digital boards with funny little tags on it you know we 'll all the numbers he can make him up at a squeeze and it was just confusing to me as a game of Scrabble and anyway I had lots of advice from they because this board has is up in amongst the crowd in the public area so anyway we managed to stumble through towards the end very last couple seconds of the game the greatest kick goal bang and the school was to come up as that they won by a point in any way the the central umpires and the other umpires conferred in the middle for about 10 minutes or so and I was woke waiting for the signal from the senator yeah did he clear that board was right but it never came and then everybody started to go over towards the sheds the public area and then I sung out to the MP I said hey what a burn amber I may have won by a point and I swore to you where is this leave us in anyway they go on into the sheds and that Deora forth the initial euphoria was domed right down then because they the creature thought they 'd won in anyway then I had another conference about at all and it was about half an hour later that they decided after that Sun that the Armijo people had some me there this song that that one they 're breaking out the beer and whatever you nickname yeah and then it was reversed again and by this time a lot of the disappointed great supporters had gone home anyone so that was my sector day and I think I 'll have to injure another one like that for a while so I thank you mister me Thank You counsel Buckley counselor Ellis I 'm almost speechless I don 't think any report any report could ever match that I think I 'm like everyone else I 've just double check my diary because I had a particularly busy July but when I that they 're quite few and far between NAIDOC week as council rates referred to was an important week for the Shire and was celebrated across the entire region a couple of points I attended on behalf of the mayor the annual u3a and your general meeting and presentations it was my privilege to take part in the awarding of a number of long service awards to the stewards of that organization and you know an organization when that excess of 400 members out of all of that I 'd like to acknowledge in particular work of mr. and mrs. Bernhard West who are a stalwart sand and really are part of the engine room of that organization I also attend with other councillors one hundred and fiftieth year celebration of the shore of been style and in particular visiting the exhibition of memorability to celebrate the occasion conducted by the VIN style Historical Society in the most impressive location in building seven celebration was the wonderful opportunity on an understanding of the many challenges that still face our current council that arose from those days of the Shire of 'll submit the council that headlines a number a couple of other matters Thank You mr. mayor Thank You council I was bit concerned that you were going to mention that you saw a picture of me in the Historical Society I was worried about I saw a great haircut mr. mee councillor white Thank You mr. Muir just a it 's been a reasonably busy month but of just a few brief comments chairing the livestock sadly committee meeting earlier in July was was interesting that we 're now trying the the new Sheep skiing and has so far come on okay and but something else that was discussed was more about accounting sales because the last 12 months the throughputs for the yards has been quite quite substantial and it looks like Joe has done well with their charges but unfortunately a lot of those livestock have been for sales and today 's Windham spring sale as a reminder of what 's to come in that it 's a it 's well down on previous years for numbers so the the reason being that many of the stock it 's very disappointing for the farmers out there also he earlier in the month oh yeah I got the opportunity to the filling for our mayor of the inner wheel then style change over dinner and it was great it was a dinner ware item there was a lot of the people in there that I did know and it was it was great too just to congratulate them on their efforts of raising funds and and how they distribute them in the community to the less fortunate and you 've gotta say you know they do an amazing job as many of the service clubs do um also I attended the 150 years of the bean style show and it was I was quite happy to be one of the people who actually did live in the pen style the old pencil show so it was quite good and I and there was a number of people there that I hadn 't seen for many years and it was good to catch up we 've had our audit committee meeting also during that month the last thing I and it was it was really really fun and and well done to all the staff who who recognized for for their efforts for the year but I 'm thinking now it 's going to be hard to look at some of them now in a professional capacity after their stage performances and hey that 's good to see guys just coming into the room [Music] so but anyway thank you thanks Council what council pills Thank You mr. mayor my reports very brief for the month I 'm the weather 's been has been again changing with golden wattles now reaching full bloom along the mutual river and if you get the chance to go and have a look go and enjoy them because they are spectacular the river is just a bloom of golden yellow and and it 's quite a sight to see that 's only available between from seven to ten days when it 's in full bloom it 's gorgeous and unfortunately for the farmers the garden and the garden lovers we 've not had much rain but climate wise we 've been fortunate enough to 20 degrees now I say this because my I 've been busy moving my aged father we have a new resident in the region a new resident of East Gippsland he 's a 90 year old man who has come from Melbourne in fact been you know he 's been a common street businessman and he has moved to the region and he is so delighted with how easy life is for him and I wanted to put it in my report so that people in Melbourne if they 're listening to this they will say well we might even consider moving to East Gippsland because he just said the people are friendly the the Metis great the vegetables are fantastic the weather 's fantastic and it 's a great place to come and eat so with that in mind well welcome Melbourne Walter Wakefield to East Gippsland and I just like to bring up in my report the frustrating commutes that we 've had with the roadworks going to and from Melbourne and I know it 's a legacy but I just wanted to also say next week I 'll be bringing it up with the VicRoads people to see if there 's anything they can do to alleviate the wait times and the the time that we have to drop down to 40 kilometres an hour I 'm expecting roadworks to be done whereas you know in the realistic moment of it all there 's no one doing any work anywhere so I think they need to be more respectful for the road users and particularly the transport companies we 're losing downtime with it and there is a formula that actually is calculated and we could actually average out how much we 're losing in downtime and it is actually quite substantial for a trucking business like ours it would equate to about five grand a month so you know it 's not something to be snob doubt it 's a very realistic thing and I think they need to be more respectful of all road users whether they be in transport or whether they be coming to visit in our region so I 'll be bringing that to their attention next week thank you very I 've also submitted my report for the month probably a couple of key things our last meeting was up at all Boston it was great to have that meeting one of those meetings outside the corporate Center but part of that meeting we were lucky enough to get a tour of the wall boss gas plant upgrade and the significant investment of around 300 million dollars of APA refurbishing that plant was quite significant also the official opening of the Broderick boat ramp and more recently the opening of the back and almost breach was pleasing to to greet and welcomed into the region Peter green and from great meat-processing who their family have purchased the meat works at at Maui and refurbishing it to fully get it back to better than the capacity it was before but also an opportunity for them to source supply of cattle from East Gippsland in the high country the the grain of family purchased that facility in Maui and have made a commitment to Gibbs land and it will be known as the greener meat works the new refurbished facility will build given them the opportunity to connect with producers directly in our region and into the high country to develop potentially a brand specifically for East Gippsland and then councillor O 'Connell and the only VTA are also working on potentially a great high country beef brand as well the beauty of the green family it 's a fourth generation meat processing family they know their stuff they also have a supply chain robust process which is recognized around the world and if you fail producers support their facility their Quality Assurance facility and process they will also receive a premium on their livestock as they sell them through our selling East Gippsland livestock exchange so it 's a win-win situation it 's it 's an opportunity for us to again show Australia that East Gippsland is a major food producer and this traceability actually traces the cattle back to the paddock it was born so it 's a really important project and I look forward to seeing how the BTI up at ami I work with that project also had the opportunity during the month to attend the tourism vtec an excellent two-day conference with some excellent visitor economy content more importantly the program provided plenty of opportunity to network and advocate for the East Gippsland region and a visitor economy and Hardy launched her newly developed app that was researched and developed through the University of Tasmania this app has never been commercialized as tourism tracer and it gives regions that use this app an in-depth knowledge and insight into our visiting tourists and their behavior and what things they visit it actually produces a heat map of where they visit and then becomes a very useful tool for us to advocate to government where we need infrastructure and resources the other key thing that happened at that event was the tourism Victoria used the conference to launch regional Victoria your happy space and I think our region is well positioned to take advantage of this next huge launch by tourism Victoria the major intrastate tourism campaign called regional Victoria your happy space hopes to bring more Melbourne ian 's out to the region and one of the statistics that really stuck in my head was that 53% of Melbourne and into our regions and if they did and stay just one night anywhere in our regions would generate two billion dollars approximately of economic activity so a significant opportunity for us to focus on your happy space showcases our stunning region 's diverse experience and world-class food music nature and culture that Victoria has to offer tourism means serious business react economy were just over 15 million people visiting regional Victoria in 2018 up 20 percent since 2014 and spending some nine point seven billion dollars in creating thousands of jobs and just lastly the East Gippsland Shara staff Awards I did attend with councilor white and I just like to comment on Sam McPherson who achieve the individual top behaviors award top behaviors are the non-negotiable culture behaviors and pillars for the East Gippsland show organization and top is an acronym for teamwork organizational awareness prioritization and problem-solving in servicing our community 's needs and just interestingly Sam was also part of the Gippsland community leadership program in last year 's cohort and he 's really shining for the organization thank you item 5 5.1.1 is East mr. bean Council this is a report that seeks adoption of these keeps their planning scheme amendment c13 9 it also seeks to approval to launch these Gippsland planning scheme and c13 no I 'm in the midst of planning for approval under their playing environment act counselors over time there has been numerous needs to amend the plan scheme as it relates to timber cloth unfortunately there has been some removal of certain controls within the planning scheme over certain parcels of land and there has been some controls left on certain personal plan this should have been removed this amendment seeks to rectify that in addition this this proposal seeks to address some difficulties with certain landowners being able to develop their land the planning scheme sought to consolidate Lots on land that was not appropriate for development you to topography and native vegetation we 've sought to reconfigure the restructure overlay so that those properties now can be developed and avoid the significant steep slopes and vegetation on those sites indeed this amendment continues to provide some clarity for users of the planting scheme it seeks to Bluff will be introduced into the plains game and should hope to minimize these accidental errors into a future counselors there was one unsupportive submission by a landowner our officers were able to resolve the concern and therefore given their a no unsupportive submissions counsels able to make a decision to a doctor abandon this amendment without the need for an independent planning panel Council is the recommendation in front of you seeks to adopt exhibit of planning scheme documentation socially associated with the amendment adopting meander tambour bluff restructure plan including the recommended changed 26 feet of road that addressed that particular owners concerns and submit to the mister playing the adopted planning scheme amendment c13 9 thank you Thank You mr. hollow councils are there any questions if there 's no questions we do have a recommendation for us to have a mover move councillor you have a second councillor why speakers Thank You mr. mayor look I I see this as a as a common-sense amendment that that we 're making to to alleviate some issues that people have had up there in the past and you move forward and an orderly approach to to what 's happening up there so I recommend this Thank You councillor to Council what did you want to speak yes I would concur with this um in looking at the the overheads that you 've provided it just makes common sense that there was some pieces of land there virtually had no value but while you 've structured it allowing property owners to amalgamate and and particularly that feeder road where the gentleman owned the the other access point to his property I think it should satisfy those involved so I 'm happy with the with your work thank you Thank You counsel or is there any further speakers counselor Ellis just very quickly and that 's just aside this has been a 10 to 11 year journey in planning from the time that the shark took the initial and the initiative to sort out the planning problems of the Tambo Bluff or what 's known as the Blue Horizons estate mess that was inherited by council councils work through and with the members of the community at dummbell Tambo bluff for that community and that we can now move on with the most progressive development down at that part of meeting where there is a lot of economic growth and opportunity in that particular region to should be taken to any job I commend the recommendation Thank You councillor else there 's any further speakers if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor of the motion against it 's carried unanimously thank you item five point one point two is the proposal to end section 173 agreement AF to zero to nine to three J as it relates to lot to on plan of subdivision eight zero two seven one five L and lots a 1 2 3 7 8 11 12 14 15 17 to 20 22 to 27 and 29 inclusive on planet subdivision 8 0 to 7 1 869 Ashley Street and 1 1 4 Newlands Drive Paintsville mister Hollow Thank You mr. mayor mr. mayor this report seeks a council decision to provide a principle support for the ending of death of the agreement the agreement was required to ensure that the coaster the adjoining land holding known as Paintsville Park unfortunately that agreement locked in the subdivision as was approved by planning permit 583 for its later 2004 v force by saying and the agreement does not provide a future lot owner to seek to resub divide a lot even with an approved planning permit without having to in this agreement counselors we have had long discussions with the landowner that particular land land owner which is a syndicate of people have entered into new agreements that protect the community 's interest that allow they continue to have a staged manner in which the subdivision will continue to roll out it will ensure that infrastructure is provided a logical efficient manner ensure that open space is provided effectively however it will allow for the agreements to sunset upon the completion of those relevant stages and that should give some confidence to both counsel and landowners that the any of this agreement is a sense of all playing proposition counselors it 's safe this report six in principle consent in principle consent of counsel and we will undertake the necessary public notice as report as to whether the agreement should end or not will be presented back to Council in the near future thank you Thank You mr. hollow questions counselors there 's no questions we do have a recommendation counsel you have a question please I gave mr. Hodes the when you say the the proposal will or the the requirement will sunset upon finalization of each stage does that mean when every block is built on or just every block is sold in each stage upon sorry counselor upon the issue is statement of compliance that says that all the requirements for that particular stage have been met and I 'm try and I think I know what your question it is saying it is not weren 't Sun said it won 't relate to the building of the houses it will relate to the establishment of the subdivision itself so if it 's sunset and then houses would be any further questions not there is a recommendation before us counselors do we have a goober move counselor pose we have a seconder for that counsel Reeves speakers that 's not there getting organized and it 's gonna be really good substantial residents and though I know people will move into it and think facilities so please do you think these types of jobs coming on board and to be able to party Thank You councillor pills if there 's no further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against us carried unanimously thank you so item 5.1 point three is planning permit application 53 2018 P use and development of a residential village and alteration of access to a road zone category one at 00 Eastern Beach Road Lakes Entrance mister Hollow Thank You mr. mayor accordance with councils planning permit application policy this manner is being report to Council which is in excess of five million dollars councils this a proposal for a residential village its proposed to comprise of 94 dwellings community center including an indoor pool garden Fox and men 's sheds as 23 Vista car parking spaces including one accessible car space it has an internal road network and it has associated service including full bath links to the surrounding network of footpaths carried out and there was no objections raised by the local community in the planners view in a Planning Office view this is a proposal that is very well suited to Kayson well-suited to the property and fits with all the right planning policy and including the general residential ones own councils you will note that with recommendation there is there is part of that recommendation that seeks that council delegates to the chief executive office of the authority to assess and grant any amendment to the planning permit councillors this has been deliberately added into my recommendation because should counsel see fit to determine to issue a planning permit for this proposal the permit applicant has raised the question with us that they may not need to construct the swimming pool as part of the facility because they may decide to utilize lakes in Mike 's entrance Aquadome as it is a very close proximity of this proposal councils have to take questions questions from councillors counselor Ellis Thank You mr. mee can you tell me whether or not there 's any vehicle or access to golf-links Road from council any further questions I do have a couple more indulgences have the the provisions of the permit being provided to the planning staff of the applicant and to the applicant himself is he aware of the conditions of a lease a councillor and there has been numerous negotiations and discussions with this particular landowner and indeed my officer attended their private consultations with local to me as well okay so just to clarify taking into account of our more recent experiences yes it is the applicant aware of the permit conditions that are before canceled tonight and has he expressed an opinion as to whether he is satisfied unable to comply with those conditions yes the permit applicant and discussions about the provision of some footpath provision within councils existing street network also about the staging of the proposal and those conditions and the officer and the planning consultant working for the landowner we 're able to come up with a very good solution and and fashioned some conditions are satisfactory to both parties mr. hull just to clarify for something through you mr. mech whilst I 'm the we do not seek and would not expect to get any formal acknowledgement or acceptance of those conditions prior to the matter being reported to Council it is not part of the process to seek the applicants endorsement of those conditions prior to it being reported to Council for pretty obvious reasons so they may be aware of it but I don 't believe we have any formal notification from them that they that they are are either happy with them or endorse them but to our best knowledge we have informal and I guess negotiate negotiated agreement around that they are in there and we we put those conditions together with their in consultation with them to some degree and finally just one other question is do you see any other reason why the EC I would need to delegate he 's Authority if that is accepted as part of the recommendations this evening on any matters other than the swimming pool associated with this application the primary reason why the recommendation is the way it is is because of a swimming pool issue which was raised with my large proposals some finessing that may need to be undertaken I would suggest that certainly chief executive officer if he believed it was not a minor alteration that he may well choose to have the matter of whether to cancel some energy calls Thank You counselor else any further questions we do have a recommendation before us if there 's no further questions sets move counselor Ellis thank you second counselor white counselor Ellis would you like to speak to the motion Thank You mr. Mann this has been a long awaited application for use of land that are set in Lakes Entrance for a particularly long time as long as I can recall you know in an unused situation this particular application exhibits the benefits of our recent planning schema amendments initiated earlier in the year by council the program appears to be a win-win situation for the township of Lakes Entrance where in the long term we can welcome a large number of new residents to our township and take advantage of the facilities within that region the planning scheme and the conditions appeared to me to be practical and the end product is that the show will benefit from development such as this we are in need of affordable housing concepts and this perhaps it 's the first of these projects and such a scale for many years the township of Lakes Entrance will be enhanced by that matter as such I commend the recommendation before Council and look forward to the developers taking an early start in the creation of a new key thank you Thank You counselor Alice counselor white would you like to add any further it 's only to say that I fully concur with what counselor Alice has said he 's actually taken most of the comments I would have made I would perhaps go one step further without perhaps not wanting to offend the previous owners but I would have called that area foremost a wasteland and it is really good to see that something 's going to redevelop there which will benefit Lakes Entrance particularly as the the people who would move there would would be in need of services from the community rather than looking for jobs they would to the town 's amenities and supermarkets service stations etc so I I think this is a wonderful project Thank You councillor why is there any further speakers there 's no further speakers off with the motion all those in favor against its carried unanimously thank you item 5.2.1 is the report on audit and Risk Committee meeting held 24th of July 2018 he 's cashman sorry I was looking at miss Bennett Thank You mr. Lee the report before you tonight provides an overview of the issues that were considered at the audit and Risk Committee meeting held on the 24th of July 2018 as the report as a report denotes the key issues that were discussed at that particular meeting were the interim management letter in relation to the 2007 nineteen financial year order the ambit into an internal audit plan for 2018 to 2021 which was presented to us by mr. Andrews Ovitz honest who is the partner of cohort councils newly appointed internal auditor the findings from the Raymond Island Ferry audit were also tabled at that particular meeting and again the end results are not to talk back to Philip for us the draft risk management policy and framework together with the new occupational health and safety policy statement and procedures which I believe will be presented shortly mm sorry the June 2018 procurement compliance reports and its findings and further the draft project management framework which was a large body of work that had been undertaken by numerous offices and has taken quite a while to UM to come to fruition nothing of real significance was actually highlighted at that particularly particular meeting and the committee members were very complimentary of the fact that we are starting to take off some of those long-standing items which is like something to be congratulated so if there are no further questions I would like to propose that the that council from no to the report and if you there are any other questions I 'm happy to field those thank you Ames Cashman questions councillors council pals yes so we were able to delete like to amend a bit that I don 't like about it is I think it 's unnecessary just say it read their assessment the issue identified we 're not reflecting a culture issue but were the consequences of an extraordinary set of circumstances I think the the issue were was the extent of a consequence ordinary set of circumstances is better and I think we need to take out the receptacle who 's been making the recommendation that notes that but essentially this is a report so would you like to I mean the motion to add that note is that what you 'd like to do no you can certainly change the officers recommendation but you would need to put a fresh is it cancer or else did you have a question as what i do i do mr. me around coming coming out of what counsel pelts has been speaking about and and i 'm just going back to the point it 's in relation to the reporting of questions it 's not a request for an amendment and it relates to the roman island ferry order and in the report the reports not telling council at this level what actions would take away the order and risk committee in relation to the ferry all it tells us is that the officers were provided with certain informations that they cooperated with the internal organs and that they were going to look at something in future so i 'm like immediate question having said those words is what actions were taken by the ORD and risk committing relation that was council provided with details of that audit inquiry thanks councillors 7 managed the Council of work council was provided with the and they were action there were actually actions in that report and there were managers comments on that report and the Audit Committee saw all that and that was also if my recollection there was a nine-point scorecard that they went through and and scored us accordingly with requirements for comments and actions but may well be so I think you 're missing what I 'm trying to say and that is there 's no mention here that this work was reported back to counsel and counsel was the initiator of the request for this inquiry in relation to the the matter of the cut of the issue of read if you read that it says that something was done and all it was taken and it was discussed by councillors if I can refer you and you with your indulgence mister me if you reread that paragraph and probably the answer is yes a report was supplied to Council but at this stage as far as the council concerned there 's nothing we have got up report but it 's not in the report it 's not in here no I appreciate there are confidential matters what I 'm saying is that in the reporting we are not being clear it 's just saying certain things occurred if you can undo you follow what I 'm saying not a hundred percent now they would counsel but the simple thing is if I 'm a member of the public and I read the the agenda of the East Gippsland High Council and I read the report here I I read in the first sentence council requested that an internal audit be undertaken purpose which to assess tooth in two actions there was then an expectation that that report would record that this would report it back to Council so we just need to change the recommendations this report came back to Council that 's important the officer could have been de la vieille to say to me yes it was and you were provided with a report I mean when trying to be transparent here in our actually we all got a copy of that report I think you missing it 's not recorded in the minutes it 's not recorded in the report that 's what I 'm saying here if I may indulge then also presented the findings and recommendations of the Raymond Island Ferry audit report so it stated there it was counselor Ellis and it says Pro help emphasize that during the conduct of the audit they had full management cooperation and that the improvements to policy and practice have already been made so they 've made improvements to cropland policy and practices their assessment the issues identified did not reflect a cultural issue but were the consequences of an extraordinary set of circumstances that people then had to manage as best they could at no not nothing I 'm totally asking you know was this matter reported back to council back to the councils as simple as that because this here just talks about procedures and what 's have been going on not that which it was the council we the council asked what the the matter that was handled by mister weights to being looked at by the internal auditor a new on our behalf mr. mayor took that back as an action requested by Council to the Audit Committee to address yep they 've done that work but they 're not reporting back to Council that that work was undertaken now this might be only a little thing but it 's a matter of saying it 's clear and I 'm saying that that reports not that clear it should be clearly stated that council was informed and that a report was a written report was provided to Council so that we we can be may are accountable for the matters that are undertaken on our behalf count councillor Reeves so this might be a question for either miss Bennett or mr. us is that council is noting a meeting and the audit report the audit committee meeting that 's what it is we 're just noting that it took place that 's all we 're doing in this one and the content or those discussions of the Audit Committee can be accessed or made available or you know that in another form in another way shape or form this is we 're not we 're not drilling down into the different reports that were in that audit committee we are just noting that an audit committee took place and this is the meeting took place we 're noting that and here 's the content of it of that meeting well I think it is that 's that 's I respectfully understand that you disagree but that 's been the common practice that we note that an audit committee meeting took place and here 's the content and we have deferred that information to the Audit Committee is that correct through you mr. Muir you 're quite correct counselor race every document that is reviewed by the order the minutes so it recollections we had the verbal discussion in the audit committee on the 24th of July and then we had the councilor CEO discussion on the same day and miss Bennett ended up coming in and giving us a briefing and you also gave us a bit of a briefing about the Raymond Island Ferry and I think we did actually all chat about the the Raymond Island outage report which is what I 'm and it 's a document that we discuss around the table on the twenty fourth of July the day after the audit committee meeting finally just one so I don 't dispute that I don 't dispute any of the facts that 's coming up I am just simply saying that this is a report of happenings within the order committee being reported to Council then I would simply expect that I report a sentence would be saying that I just did but stating something as simple as the results of our accident were reported to the council on a certain day and that 's what was my basic question to the officer it wasn 't means are maintaining a level of transparency where an action is requested by counsel it 's processed which of what I 'm not saying it wasn 't accidents would come in it was brought back to Council and erskine but for the record that 's not showing and if we just simply pass this report as such as adopting this report then we 're not showing what what actually came from that particular order committee I mean I 'll leave it to you as counselors to make it the decision I 'm not trying to challenge what works weren 't done because the report was a value and it gave us a good understanding of certain things and smoked them a lot of that report is confidential and I 'm trying to keep that out of the the confidentiality issues out of this conversation but the point is we do have a right a need to be able to show that an action was requested by counsel counsels operating correctly as a board should do and data report was made back to Council and that 's you know nothing more the motion be put okay so we 've got a movement a second need a seconder for the motion for we put we have a seconder council polls councillor Yves has asked for the motion to be put all those in favor note once it 's been put I think once the once the motions been asked we put there 's no further debate no yeah feel free councillor person I would just like to speak to the community that the report done by trolley Howard and particularly done by Andrew said Beatson was particularly good and it was very honest and very straight to the point and I think it was a document that we needed to see particularly and I think all of us internally all of the councillors and particularly the staff got a lot out of this report I mean we learned a lot with regards to our mechanisms on areas that we needed to improve on and I think it 's been a very beneficial document for us to actually seek so I 'm just saying with regards to that it was a fantastic report the outcomes that have been that will be put into place we 'll serve our community very well into the future so thank you for that time this definitely council pearls I would reiterate your comments that was a world produced product by craft it unpacked a lot of complexities all those in favor of the motion it was a procedural motion that they motion be put but I had the right to speak against the motion okay mr. mayor I could ask for point of order yeah so the point is that I have asked the motion be put is a procedural motion when so on ask okay mr. mayor I 'm happy to indulge counselor Ellis because he is very keen to talk this matter if you are as well yes Council will think you cancel ribs you 're a decent man look I 'd simply want to say bring counselors counselors attention to the recommendation and say this that council notes this report on issues considered by these Gipson Shire Council order committee at its meeting on the 24th of July 2018 my my point against this representation of a particular action taken I want to clarify so it 's very clear the issue of the report it 's not in question by note number one number two that if that report was brought to councillors for consideration in this fashion is not in dispute either I have no dispute with any of the things that council felt said in relation to the report nor in fact with what councillor Reeves is also suggested what I 'm saying is that for such an important thing remembering the amounts of money and the actions in it and in the impact on our community there there was an action taken by council and it has not been reported what what happened as the result of that deed council get a response to that no it 's something that stayed within the bowels of the organization and in terms of processes and what have you again not a negative comment but it should have just been reported back to me no well it 's not it 's a per se it 's the process in a transparency process it 's _''_4531.69 not here to argue on that one mr. mee that 's my opposition to the motion before the council thank you oh I 'll put the motion all those in favor against motions carried six in favor two against thank you Mr Cashman the item 5.2 point two is reviewable counsels policies workplace health and safety counselors we 've reached that part of the meeting where I know you look forward to when we talk about policy because of the excitement factor however this is a very significant policy covering as it does the way that we look after people contractors force so we 're talking about occupational health and safety it 's only twelve months since you last considered an occupational health and safety policy however there have been some changes since then essentially what has occurred in the intervening period as counsel has transferred across to the ma-vess work is self insurance workers compensation scheme and one of the benefits of doing so is a policy being sorry a suite of policies and procedures being rolled out by the MOV to participate in councils so while I believe to a whole new level and we 're being encouraged to basically adopt consistent documentation which will which will mean that we will comply with the benchmark standard so as part of that we 're presenting to you this evening a new occupational health and safety policy perhaps I refreshed one together with a one-pager that is basically summary of that policy and we 're wanting you to approve the format and we 're also seeking your approval to change the state of the Occupational Health and Safety policy from a council policy to a management policy and to change the frequency of review to the current annual cycle one that 's based on three merely now the reasons for that essentially firstly consistency with what we 're being told is very standard but also what I think is the more compelling reason is that policies by their nature higher level and essentially give the principles through which in this case occupational health and safety will be delivered it 's the other documents which are referenced in point five of your recommendation being the occupational health and safety planning procedure disclosure the audit committee did look at all of this documentation and its last meeting and was not able to form for recommendation to Council on recommendation three which is the one around changing the policy status from the castle and the arguments for and against the other part of that was some members of your community felt that because of this is a very important policy it should be driven at council level and therefore there was some sentiment that shouldn 't be a management policy some sentiment it was perfectly appropriate however there was no opposition to the proposal to change it to a three-year review given its higher order status and essentially so I 'm very happy to take any questions on that essentially that 's what the recommendation is seeking questions from councilors counseling pals just a point of clarification given the fact that the new proposal is for a three-year review will it actually be whilst it 's saying a three-year review document like this I believe coming from the business and your business has many similarities our H and s needs to be reviewed you can upgrade things and whilst the base policy is there the review of systems and its safety for your staff needs to be just curious as to you know the actual mechanism there please the policy that 's why it 's being proposed the other documents represent will be subject but I would add that should for example new legislation if it 's a management policy those changes any further questions councils we have a recommendation if there 's no move counselor polls you have a second to counselor to e speakers counsel pills just you know I like Janice it 's one of most critical parts to a business a staffing issue that needs to will make our staffs life easier without giving any criticism to everyday mechanisms of our H and s issues thank you thanks counselor pills any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried unanimously thank you item six mr. CEOs any urgent other and other business received No thank you mr. CEO we have some contracts that we need to discuss I 'm happy to move that we I move the Council on Oakley I 'll close the meeting to the public in accordance with the provisions of section 8 89 2d of the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item seven one two seven point seven point one two seven point six as these items relate to contractual matters counselors are new so let 's move councillor Reeves we have a second if the counselor polls all all those in favor against its carried unanimously thank you _"

Yan Fotheringham regarding 110 pounds right he 's following him Thank You mr. following Han part of the rules of this presentation or talking verbally to to your question is that you know we will obviously need you to stick to the topic at hand and that there 's your respect shown in both directions thank you the questions I have tonight regards the development plan application for a hundred and ten Paris Road which is on tonight 's agenda and I 'd like two questions answered please the development plan has been created without an intersection design for the access point to Palmers Road the application document and that card no reports specify that an auxilary left turning lane and the channelized right turning lane will be required this means a major realignment of the road with this stretch of Parma 's road becoming four lanes wide a significant change from the will also impact on the native vegetation precinct plan created by Council which is identified the area of Lane this intersection would clear as being a habitat zone of native vegetation that needs to be protected and should not be removed if council were to prematurely approve this plan tonight without a proper intersection design that shows the new roadway layout and the impact to the habitat zone that intersection will have I feel that the community will have been removed from the consultation process whether it 's one tree or 102 extra lanes of traffic or twenty their reports needed to explain how the community will be impacted should at the very least have been completed to allow councilors to make an informed decision to approve the development plan as this would also remove all third party objectives from having any future so in this intersection design and the associated removal of habitat the council have said should not be removed the questions I 'd like answer though given that the approval of a development plan is bonding and can 't_''_414.77 be challenged and that with a little bit been presented for public comment why have council officers chosen to bring this development plan before council tonight when it is not yet complete so that those two questions there 's a second question I do council think it is in the community 's best interest to approve an incomplete development plan that 's missing reports thereby removing the community 's ability to voice concerns or even read those reports when they are finally completed Thank You mr. Nelson would you like to answer those questions please yes the development plan approval process and the strategic planning work that was done in the lead-up to the not lakes northern growth area process provides us with significant strategic information on which to judge or not the ability to approve the development plan that 's presented to you tonight so there 's a significant amount of work looking at the native and native vegetation precinct plan so how we manage there the loss of vegetation across the entire precinct rather than on a site by site basis there is a quite a lot of work done looking at traffic requirements drainage and the development plan through the process of amending the planning scheme to include the development plan requirements in the master plan for Lakes Entrance northern growth area there was a public consultation phase that 's the phase through this process where the community are engaged formally in a sense and can comment on the development outcomes that we 're seeking to achieve Council does have a policy that that we comply with where we do seek feedback from effective community members through the development plan process there isn 't any statutory requirement for counsel to do that but we do that and we take into account any feedback that is received from community members through that process the reality is that the the planning scheme which includes the requirements to be met for a development plan overloads be approved is set out in the in this scheme itself so it 's very public and we believe that in this case there 's sufficient detail for us to recommend that council approve the development plan at a strategic level and the detail associated with the approval of a subsequent planning permit exception that there is no no ability for third party objections and appeals in this case so the process is different here we go through determining at a strategic level what the requirements are we go through a process of engaging the community on the strategic level development plan overlay and then the landowner the developers can proceed with some level of confidence about the the planning permit requirements that they 'll then be that they 'll then encounter Thank You mr. father very further public questions Adam one point eight point one is the assemblies of counselors for May 2018 we have a list there we

particular and take note of the rural council summit that was here in Lakes Entrance this month and in particular not just the fact that there were 38 we 're all Shire representatives here over 80 or 90 councillors but of most rural shiz 79 is it okay I 'd stand corrected there was the fact that we as a council invited our local community representatives to attend that summit and I think that was a real highlight for me so as an example we had Rhonda man Oh Mia Joan more from New Orleans arm lisa camp from mouth Rivers District Hobart boning Jenny Hawker from Mountain rivers guru community Deb Foskey Mount Rivers District uh Bert James Anthony Matt rivers district ghungroo Gary Brantley from Ken river correct Cameron from Ken River Aileen Blackburn from cannon River Marion Dawson Twin Rivers districts Sonya West from Twin Rivers of L my West Twin Rivers and Michael Aqsa from Twin Rivers get our local community members involved in local government and I provided an opportunity that for them to be involved in current place and community plans which is what we 're working on as a community and access quality input by speakers around economic ideas currently impacting on our community among other things ladies and gentleman the rest of my report is there but I really wanted to highlight that those community members and those some far-flung communities were represented at the rural summit here in lakes entrances month Thank You councillor Reeves council Roberts Thank You mr. mayor I 'll keep it brief um I just would like to touch on something I didn 't get a chance to touch on last month as it wasn 't here but I attended the youth color fest and I spoke on behalf of the mayor the Victorian Youth Week event the core organizational group behind the event consists of freezer and our very own youth ambassadors they displayed fantastic management skills and provided a very fun and engaging event they showcase great talent with local live music with a skate BMX behaved and the the hard work that that those that the the youth that were putting on that event showed was just outstanding so I would like to give her congratulations to those and um hold s thank you yep Thank You council roads council pills mr. mee yes it has been a busy month I 'm feeling for the farmers with the lack of rain that we 've had but with the rain we have had it 's it 's good to see that the weather still warm enough to push up the grass but the month I have been busy with the road commitments to the Shire with our seats meeting being held in Shoalhaven the seven hour drive and I took the liberty of driving all the way up the princes Highway and I got over the border and I was quite envious of their road and how much it 's developed in their hundreds of millions of dollars that have been put into road upgrades up there so has a commitment to our region for the 17 councils that reside between Dani Nong and Gong and the upper and lower house for them to consider it in regards to putting it on the road of significance and therefore aiming for additional funding for our region and we are pushing to have dual lanes all the way through VicRoads the project that can river at the roundabout is well underway and also their commitment to our rest areas that they actually had funded that 's all happening to the east of us when I was at the seats meeting Harvey dinelli reported from transport Victorian and he mentioned that they are finalizing the Stratford rail bridge duplication the plans at the moment and yes it will be going ahead and that BIC road still has an additional 250,000 to spend on the bends down area which will it 's on the bends down Main Street safety upgrade it was to address the Western store section the alternative transport route which included an alternative access over the mutual vigor which I think the whole of the Exeter Victoria will adore when it comes into play because it 's a B it will be a big figure item and future of our region to safeguarded against flood and issues that we have foundation one of the interesting things that I attended was mov transport infrastructure last week and we had an addressing from transport Victoria on autonomous vehicles and how they might work in our communities the interesting thing that stood out about this was the fact it needs to come if we all become reliant on like uber vehicles basically there 'll be huge areas of car parking that will become available for community offset areas and so car parking might be an issue in the future there 'll be open lane developments or perhaps housing so it was a curious conversation that we had around the table about urbanization and open space coming through one of the other things they also spoke about was congestion compliant and they 're actually trying a project with inner Melbourne and they 're saying that the road development occupation charges are being put up between 1200 and 1800 dollars per Lane per week and mainly based on congestion impact and the bottom line is it cannot be it 'll be something they don 't actually have any kind of local laws and the permits will come through council and we will be receiving charges as far as they can work out so that 's sort of an interesting throwback from that meeting that we went to last week Thank You council pals council wife Thank You mr. Muir um due to the fact that I had one month 's leave of absence I actually have nothing to report so that may be a relief to many around the table thank you Thanks cancel what cancer Ellis okay thanks for me that 's a bit hard to beat look it 's an opening coming I think I 'd like to welcome everyone here this evening though I 'm not sure when Council last conducted an ordinary meaning here and lakes which I think was probably in the late 90s early 2000 perhaps it 's great to see an ordering meeting of council back here at Lakes Entrance Council must remember of course this was our original headquarters and napur oakley I 'm sad that we shifted two bends down hopefully this will coming down here to lakes end to the other regions throughout our wonderful Sean I 'll keep my report very very brief this evening and just mention a couple of more parochial matters I attended the present the surf club the annual paddle challenge this year it 's one of the surf clubs major fundraising events I also attended the bullet island community information and consultation days conducted by dope and the show the sessions included noting and acknowledging that their stress some members of our community experienced by the seemingly random and perhaps all thought placement of numerous bollards placed on the island to manage vehicle parking I visit you know visited the Benson district family history group referred to by counsel of TUI and they are an inspirational group and I 'm pleased to say so is our family history group here and his crew here and Lakes Entrance alright continuing on the parochial manner I further attended the Victorian coastal councils final Awards tonight back in in the end of May and I 'm pleased to advise that the biodiversity and conservation award was won by Gippsland was awarded to the Tambo bluff coast care group I further attended and company with the mare in the CR the regional shared services formed briefing at Tyrolean where the outline original eyes services and local and local government will continue into the future I also attended the future of local government forum in Melbourne and will be circulating the presentations by many challenging futurists and other speakers in the coming weeks as they become available I finally attended the MA V state conference at in Melbourne before we could go where many issues impacting upon our communities were hotly debated and in preparation for further advocacy to government as the election cycle comes even closer and can come like include by referring to the launch of the tender for the off slipway site it likes entrance and I look forward to a briefing from Council on the process an understanding Court councils important lead role in that matter and how we came to hold that position Thank You mr. mee thanks cancerous Council Buckley Thank You mr. mayor on the evening of Wednesday the 30th last month I attended happily I I ain 't even got a small part in the play and it didn 't even require me to die enclosed the presenters have asked me to pass on the people that were sponsoring this and this a notable a couple of notable ones of course including us and dementia Australia and palliative care and so forth and it was a very interesting and playing and to put the lighter side go into the form [Music] and anyway then on the Fenian for the mayor who 's a very busy man I went on a reconciliation cruise on the 31st and found it most interesting in spite of the weather 10 out of the 40 of the guests did not turn up and that was quite understandable under the circumstances on the next day I attended the reconciliation function at the West Bend style primary it was well attended and very and very well presented Thank You mr. mayor thanks Council Buckley I just like to mention a couple of items I 've just provided my report but the first one I 'd like to talk about is neighbors the cross-border collaboration that we 've started off really strongly with in relation to the Canberra region joint organization which is a series of councils that border our the state border and it was pleasing to see that the Victorian state government its recent budget has also now have a line item in its budget for a cross-border commissioner in Victoria and I think there 's some significant opportunity for us to work closer with our neighbors and one of the early identified opportunities around the country University Centre and potentially being able to steps establish something similar in East Gippsland to the Kuna model which is a really good model which has helped keep their young people in their region educating themselves but also more importantly people that want to have a change in career the opportunity to study locally at any university and any degree through this fantastic facility my colleagues and I launched their East Gippsland show cultural awareness video and I 'm pleased to say that we were nominated for a state award which we got to receive the highly commended award heart stands for v awards and was it 's an initiative by reconciliation Victoria in partnership with Victoria local governments Association on V LGA and supported by the Bank of Australian local gun Victoria the awards were handed out by the our Minister and recognize these awards recognised Victorian initiatives that contribute to local reconciliation outcomes in the local government category were up against some pretty hard hitters and the our video our commitment to reconciliation got saw a shortlisted to the last three but we 're up against Darren Glen Eira greater Shepherd in Moonee Valley and now Alexander I 'd like to thank all the people involved in producing our prize-winning cultural awareness video the people like RT doris patent grant and mullet rob hudson organizations like g jack and their staff Glo work and their stuff our council staff particularly the human resources team and the two people that accompany me to Melbourne to receive our award Jamie Lynch and Rebecca Ashton and of course special thanks to videographer Julian Stannis who has done an amazing job and I encourage anybody that hasn 't seen the full video to have heightened the experience of viewing this exceptional video thank you there is a link yes so that brings us to item r5 point once and 5.1.1 a disability Advisory Committee appointment Thank You mr. mayor this item is presented tonight for council consideration and specifically to seek your appointment of chair and deputy chair for the council 's disability Advisory Committee the advised disability Advisory Committee is a committee that counsels required to have the members of it our volunteers and supported by staff and a counselor representative firm counselor Ellis the terms of reference that were adopted by council only relatively recently require that council will formally appoint of these positions from the membership of the committee and that they 'll serve for a two-year period and we 're at the point now where nominations from the committee have been sought and presented to Council and tonight we are seeking your endorsement of both a position of chair and deputy chair for a two-year period questions thank you I also need questions counsel pills at one side so we had three people applying the the process was that yes one of those members has decided to withdraw there I 've decided to withdraw then their nomination has taken leave from the committee at this time so further expression of interest was carried out with the committee and so there are two people to a point to two positions so any further questions from counselors counselor polls you 'd like to move no no to recommend that the council formally adopt ex counselor Jeff McNeil to the position of chair 4sq to ensure I counsel disability advisory committee can from Wednesday the 6th of May 2018 for a two-year period and Council formally appoint brenton Dinsdale to the position of Deputy Chair for the supporting role for the disability Shire Council disability advisory committee commencing from Wednesday the 6th of May 2013 for a two-year period Thank You councillor polls do we have a second if councillor Reeves speakers for I 'd like to state the work that the disability advisory committee does plays a big role in voicing difficulties of access and inclusion within our communities their work aids in areas of planning strategy and investment improvements and in with disabilities but also our aging communities which is all of us basically it draws on the expertise and experiences of these people with disabilities their carers employers and businesses and community groups and basically they address all aspects and helps Council to support inclusion and accessibility in to our strategies planning and policies any further speakers councils I just want to bring to council 's attention the importance of this map of this advisory committee it crosses across our full policy in relation to inclusion and diversity and of course represents the group under various groups of persons with a disability in our community it helps us to consider policy and that helps us to have empathy with others perhaps less fortunate to us and helps us in looking around our streets and the difficulties faced by those who are not full abled bodied as such I considered this to be a particularly important position and appointment and as a committee one of the most important of the advisory committees that council possesses and as such I encourage cancels to consider deeply the recommendations before you thank you Thank motion all those in favor against yes so item are 5.2.1 he 's development plan at 110 to 138 Palmer 's Road likes entrance mr. mayor mr. you and fathering and wants to make a verbal submission on this planning on this matter thank you do you like to come forward I think you counsel for allowing the opportunity to just speak again about this I don 't really know where to start I feel that council officers have got this one wrong Katyn McCallum the team do a fantastic job and I what I say now is no disrespect to them I think the perhaps of their subdivision is and the bulk of my issue there 's a single house block that 's getting subdivided as stage one that the people who own the land obviously own that stage one because no work is needed to be done to the roads to power anything there 's no work needs to be done it 's an existing house rather and say oh I 've asked for all of the technical reports to be deferred until stage two is completed if technical reports which detail the intersection here at home is Road that the native vegetation precinct plans and the vegetation removal all of that technical stuff that I think 's in the community 's interests and needs to have a say on we lose our voice we lose our opportunity to have a say on that information regardless of the outcome regardless of whether you know we 're forward or against it we should have the right to say yes we like this or no we don 't and at this point in time if you guys approve this development plan I believe that we lose that right there 's a few things that make me concerned even more like when I read through the reports the way that the Planning Department is dismissed some of the objections and it 's been quite a few I think most of them have been dismissed by saying this will be covered in the planning permit down the track this will be covered in the plan you commit over there like it it 's like the whole thing has been pushed out of that initial block that they could subdivide off first without having to do any work if they had to do work from stage two all of these documents would have had to have been provided up front I and the rest of the community would have had an opportunity to speak to them as it is the plane that was provided and as Kate said it 's been out to community consultation things like that because it lacked the intersection design elack 's how much Bush is going to be removed elack 's the traffic impact assessment only three main things that affect our day-to-day lives down the road eight to ten times a day we see this every day those that information was missing when it got put out to public consultation so I don 't think the public consultation process has actually been as successful as it should have been because people didn 't have the information to make an informed decision and kind of hop up in a moment you have all the technical jargon is till to why they can do this and while I can there I 've lost my right to have a say in something that I use every day and I think that sucks some of the other things that that stick out in the report I mean obviously this gets put out to the Delp and East Gippsland what are all those sorts of people in regards to the vegetation that does need to be removed delp 's response to council on the matter is the department is concerned that native vegetation is proposed to be removed that is contrary to the lakes entrance northern growth adoption area native vegetation precinct land dated October 2013 even Delp is saying hang on a minute this isn 't right East Gippsland water supports the development however notes that the master planning for this area were for the development occurring between twenty thirty nine and twenty sixteen therefore the developer will need to work closely with East Gippsland what in relation to the provision of water and sewer might be able to press the button am I not good to go anywhere like to take that time for the developer and to say hang information here like I understand this it costs to do some of the expensive reports hired jolt and geology geology or sort of nonsense to these on the intersection I and and say how much bush is gonna get taken out I thought that was a fairly easy thing for them to do and I suppose I 'm a little bit disappointed that it has come this far without that having been done so I suppose I mean once it 's approved the community loses its voice in any other application all that supporting documents would have had to be provided at the start of the approval process all I ask is that my opportunity to read and respond to these documents wreck our said their findings it 's not taken away from me or the rest of the community and I think that 's in the community 's best interest and I think by approving this tonight you 're going against that thank you very much thank you thank you for your presentation who 's Nelson mr. Muir I 've found I know it 's it 's not it but it perhaps would before mr. Richards introduces the item perhaps just provide some context for the process yes the approval of subdivision using development plans is something that is read still reasonably new in East Gippsland it 's a new way of dealing with and providing developers and the community with some certainty at a very early part of the process so as I said earlier the overall plan for how the northern growth area in Lakes Entrance will develop was dealt with through the master planning work that we 've done for lakes northern growth area and that 's contained in the scheme the scheme has been amended to require that developers provide detailed to meet the development plan overlay and that 's what you 're seeing today so we don 't we 're approving an overall development plan for this property it 's not a planning permit there 's a planning permit that is subsequently required but this process shifts the the opportunity for community members to be involved at that higher level strategic part of the process so that people can understand what the overall scheme strategy is in terms of the rollout of infrastructure the way that we deal with the environmental impact and other matters as you can see from the plan there 's quite a number of things that we do assess including access to services and those sorts of things so the the complaint here is that there is no longer a right to be involved or ability to be involved in the detail and that 's absolutely what the case is here because the detail is really much of the technical information in terms of standards that need to be met for intersection roadworks connection to sewer it 's the the technical servicing of the subdivision the objections were I guess assists or the the comments made by community members were assessed in respect to whether they were able were those things were able to be addressed or should be addressed at the strategic level so the development plan level or whether they are matters of detail that need to be considered as part of the planning permit application and the reality is that we don 't expect everybody to provide for a planning permit at this strategic stage it 's just not reasonable to expect before people know that they have approval to have developed on the detailed design of that intersection but I can assure you that the detailed design and and the other matters that are of concern are picked up through the planning permit process and there a technical they 're more of a technical requirement in respect to the detail of how the subdivision is developed and in this case we 're talking about in the first stage just the excise of a dwelling and then the later details will be provided as part of a future approval process so I hope that just provides a little bit of context for people its intended to give people certainty both the community and the developer upfront what the scope of the development will be but it doesn 't it does purposefully eliminate involvement in the planning permit because it 's about the detail rather than the strategy of how the development will happen thank you council roberts had a question thank you miss Nelson is there gonna is there going to be any other opportunities for members of the public to make submissions on this not what not once these development plans are proved no it 's basically saying on the basis of this process we 're happy to say to Council you should endorse the development plan because it meets the requirements of the eschaton planning scheme the development plan overlay while there is a secondary approval process through a planning permit application the development plan over the planning scheme specifically exempts the application from third party objection and appeals mr. Richards did you want to introduce I 'm sorry counselor Ellis thanks mister me I 'm just concerned so that the community are clearly understands the situation what if it becomes apparent and mr. Pradhan can refer to this that is traffic issues that arise from Thomas Road which is a not not a high quality Road what if they 're identified and brought to the attention of counsel what actions can a member of the community expect in this circumstances if we in adopting a development plan this evening and the gate the right what might be single terms as at planning floor there 's nothing preventing people highlighting traffic issues if they subsequently result from the future development of these landers I suspect that there won 't be any visible traffic issues in combs Road as a result of this development any time soon Council has through the the lakes in northern growth area process some obligations to collect funds from developers and also upgrade roads in the precinct and my understanding I do understand that the residents are that one of their primary focus points is the state or the status of Thomas Road and my understanding is the draft budget actually includes some funds to undertake some design work in future years so it 's something that he 's on councils radar it 's not it 's not an obligation of sole obligation of the developers to look at upgrading Palmer 's Road as that would be unreasonable you 've got to appreciate this but again the concept of Korea seeing the northern growth strategy seeing through requires Council to consider the adoption of development planes can ask mr. weights just give camps some indication when the pomace Road or the northern growths area covered by the strategy of Lakes Entrance would be covered by the capital works and out would approach programs cancer Ellis it 's very much a question well how long 's a piece of string you depend very much on the rate of development in the number of allotments that are developed at this point in time I wouldn 't say that required any urgent upgrading at all it 's holding up quite well the traffic 's not any ridiculous volume on it but there will be a tipping point where the amount of development will require an upgrade but that will be conditioned as the stages of the development progress thanks counsels council pose okay with regards to [Music] proposing for Stage one to be the undeveloped land which was considered to be Park legs and I felt it was been unreasonable to be having the the stage one being the open space as stage one whereas they haven 't sold any blocks yet to be able to make any profit to be passing it on has proposed that as stage one not us but it does recognize that there is a parcel of open space to be provided as part of the subdivision the first stage is at this point in time simply exciting an existing dwelling so we 're not creating anything more than that and the stage one has been laid out in a way that it could be appropriately subdivided further into the future so the the developers intent so that the the purpose of the development plan overlay is to say this is how this land will be developed over time so that we can see how the land will be laid out how open space will be provided how will protect the waterway that flows there through there did I say how the how the road network connects up already so it gives everyone a clear understanding of how this land will be developed how it will connect with adjoining land where the access point will be on to Palmer 's road and not at this stage no so the the details sorry can 't you Johnny did you thank provides details of the intersection treatment that will be required at the time that that happens and counselors might recall when we adopted the development plan overlay and approvals for the land immediately to the east the Marin bear estate we required that developer to also contribute to that intersection and roadway connection so there 's an overall plan here the the the high level detail is provided here in conjunction with the requirements of the planning scheme and the technical details are addressed through the planning permit application Council you had a question Thank You mr. mayor Kate the the benefit or otherwise of the change in the system to to go through a development plan first what is the major difference between that and what we had and why has that change occurred well the chain I guess the change is occurred because in this particular part of Lakes Entrance we 're dealing with multiple landowners all with land zoned residential and which has to comply with an overall scheme for how this area will develop so whenever any of the landowners approaches us in in respect to they meet the overall plan for the lakes northern growth area so we 're asking them all upfront and demonstrate how their land will be developed at a at this kind of level of detail and that gives them certainty that they understand what they 're approved to have to be developing so what the what the high level conditions are and we approve the the overall structure plan for this part of part of Lakes Entrance through the planning scheme process so this is embedded in the planning scheme and we also provide people with an opportunity to comment on this level of detail the benefit to the developer is that they don 't have to come back for every single stage and seek a planning permit for every single stage and go through a public process the benefit for the surrounding land owners is that they can see the overall end development that will be achieved here and if it changes it has to go through a process so it is different because not every single stage will be will be put out there but we 're saying you can do and the landowner this is what you can expect to see happen rather than seeing them seeing it in dribs and drabs the reason I asked the reason I asked that question kate is that it appears that people have less of an opportunity to have input in regards to what 's happening within their community and how things are being done within their community is that actually the case look that 's that it may depend how you view it but what we 're saying is that we 're telling people up front right from the beginning what they can expect to see in terms of development of the northern growth area in Lakes Entrance if they really want to comment on the detail around vegetation removal intersection treatments where driveways are what kind of fences you know that 's a different proposition but really what we 're saying is those things are captured by the process it 's not it 's it 's basically saying to the community you really need to look at this at a higher level the technical details which are set there 's there 's not a lot that would change in terms of that detail council region yeah thanks mr. mayor and Kate I think that your last comment has just emphasized again to assuage and reassure the community members about these matters and I think I heard you say the technical details are addressed in the planning permit process and that 's where further input is possible for example treatments if there is potential for treatments of intersections even though they are guided by standards and VicRoads processes for example but just to reassure people that is a high-level view this is where things are going to lie when we get down to the detail there is another opportunity in the planning process no I 'm sorry if I haven 't been cleared no there 's there 's not another there is not another opportunity if there is a planning permit but it 's exempt from a notice and objection so we this process which is common throughout Victoria it 's about giving people certainty about the overall outcome without people getting having to get involved in the day the bigger picture understanding the overall outcome rather than seeing it happen in dribs and drabs so so it 's a more strategic approach to the way that towns will expand and and develop and in a circumstance like this it 's really important because you know with the marrying Bauer Heights that there had always been this intent to connect the road network through to Palmer 's Road but there was no way to actually make it happen the development plan overlay and the overall outline development plan for here is the mechanism for making that happen if it happens on a stage by stage property by property basis then you don 't get to understand how you create accessible well-developed well serviced efficiently serviced residential areas with the facilities that need to support that growing population that 's what this purpose the purpose of this is not to engage the community in the nitty-gritty details of servicing a subdivision councils Thank You mr. mayor it 's just she 's council a run the direction of cares the raised question and that we turned and I returned back to a member of the public identifies an issue in relation to as to the roadways and works being done that don 't seem to match with the strategic direction of the development plane that neighbor of the community does have the right to bring that to the attention of Council and anticipate council reacting in a in an appropriate manner to that observation all I can say is we won 't be approving anything that 's not in accordance with the development plan requirements that that 's the reality if there are other off-site impacts that aren 't anticipated or emerge over time then people can raise traffic hazards or safety concerns with us at any time that they this is right if I 'm saying this is an action outside of the pros a planning permit process which we can no longer improve I think that 's you 've made that clear it 's just that the issue up in the the issues of concern being brought to councils attention and that that will be paid to courtesy of that being considered yes any further questions on on that like to add I think most of its been covered but I suppose I will just summarize the process that we went through for this particular development application it was lodged in 2017 hmm excuse me modified plan set was received in 2018 the plans were modified to facilitate early release of road connection from Palmer 's road to marrying bow Heights and to a naval early creation of reserved open space purposes to get that done early and early in the project early in the piece and the land will be subject to a future payment of development contributions comprising community infrastructure levee drainage levee and residential levy a detailed assessment was undertaken by council council officers and this is provided as an attachment Community Engagement took place and eight submissions were received we did also receive a request to view the amended documents last month the engagement report offers a response and actions regarding the submission are also attached to the report so the reports now director the recommendations now presented for endorsement with the outcome the intent of the outcome to facilitate residential growth for Lakes Entrance any further questions councillors do you have a recommendation before us we have a mover for the recommendation moved counselor Ellis happy tonight so we 're seconded counselor polls speakers very briefly for it I encourage counselors to support this next day jarred the northern growth strategy for Lake Center and considered planning is an appropriate thing for our town well into the future and for all counts throughout the East Gippsland Shire it has been a fairly good process and that process will continue with the others further stages of this project as such councillors I recommend the motion before you thanks councils second would you like to speak this development is probably the first of a few that we 'll have in our region but we need to sort of embrace and go with the process I feel that this is consistent with our northern growth strategy for Lakes Entrance and some of the it will take a bit of pressure off some of the lower lying areas the natural development from what we already have in this region it 's progressive development up the hill and we so I look forward to this process thank you thank you council pose any further speakers it 's no further speakers I 'll put the emotion all those in favor against item 5.2 0.2 is East Gippsland playing scam mm c 143 rezone and subdivide 28 Main Street Linda no I believe we have a couple yeah mr. mayor we have two speakers the first speaker is mr. Chris kono who 's a principal planner at beverage Williams welcome Chris I 'm coming through loud and clear I 'd like to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to speak in relation to planning scheme amendment C 143 my name is Chris Cove I 'm a principal town planner with Victoria 's largest land survey firm Everage Williams Co I work in our bands talents our offices the submissions that I will provide seed me and made on behalf of Michael freshwater here 's the proponent of planting scheme amendment C 143 the aim of these submissions is to demonstrate to council the wisdom in supporting the amendment first I 'll list the aspects of the officers report that pertinent matters that we believe were admitted emitted from the report finally I 'll discuss the points upon which we disagree with the officers report and why they justify proceeding with amendment C 143 without delay so the aspects we agree with one we accept and agree with the description of the characteristics of the subject site and the manner in which Michael uses the escarpment portion the upper terrace for residential purposes at the moment so we accept and agree with the description of what MMC 143 seeks to achieve I the rezoning of the escarpment land from farming zone to Township zone the following matters are ones we believe were emitted from the officer report one we don 't believe that it was made adequately clear to the councillors that Michaels escarpment land is directly about it on its east west and south sides by blocks that are already both in the township zone and used for residential purposes there was no mention of the fact that when we approach Council about this rezoning a year ago it was given the green light then through the following ten and the state government it was all green lights let 's get on with it great idea this lasted until six weeks ago at which point we were patiently waiting for the matter to be reported to Council for approval to go on exhibition to the general public when we were called into a meeting with council officers at this meeting of different council officers from the ones we 've been dealing with at this meeting we were advised that while there wasn 't anything particularly wrong with what we wanted to do they wanted us to wait until a structure plan was prepared for linden idea in other words the light that had been green all the way change to orange and we 're told to wait we asked when the lindo structured window when the Linda no structure plan would be ready we 're told there was no money in the budget for it and no idea when it would be done as you 'd understand this was all perplexing to learn after 10 months or nearly a year of mutual collaboration that period of composite Cabell collaboration the need for a structured plan were raised until six weeks ago when we were sprung with a surprise I don 't know how much everyone else likes stopping or being confronted with orange traffic lights when you didn 't set them coming coming out of nowhere but we didn 't so Michael decided to press ahead and get a resolution from Council on whether it was agreed that there was a need to wait for the preparation of a structured plan before his land Kebir is owned or not which is why we 're here tonight this leads me to the matters in the officers report that we disagree with the first is that officers are suggesting to council the spot site-specific planning scheme amendments that don 't really directly relate to a structure plan are normally discouraged I 've been a town planner for 18 years and I 've just completed the biggest privately run rezoning in the history of the Wellington show counsellor but I don 't think that you need anything like that kind of background in town planning to know that if your property directly over the road and yet you all use your land for the same purpose i residential purposes then your zoning is an anomaly and that is the case with michael 's escarpment land council carry out rezoning to routinely correct anomalies in the planning scheme before they prepare structure plans a few times a year so for officers to suggest to council that a site-specific rezoning is inappropriate without a structure plan is misleading after all if it was true and there was no way that the rezoning of councillor to his land from farming zone to Township zone a few doors up would ever have received support from planting panels Victoria or from the state government yep it did and was resigned on the 10th of April 2014 without there being a structure plan fill in demo in place even though the town had a much bigger land supply and it does today I 'm afraid councillors that the reason why the light that had been green for 10 months inexplicably inexplicably turned orange six weeks ago is clearly revealed in the officer 's report where a request is to fund the preparation of a structure plan for Lindemann now I never knew a successful bureaucrat who passed up an opportunity to ask for money so I fear play but I guess we shouldn 't have been surprised that when they saw the evidence in Michael 's submission that Linden though was growing they would try to use it as leverage to improve their budget so to recap we want council to understand that the officers suggestion that amendment c 143 is premature until a structure plan is prepared falinda though is both unsupported by tangible evidence and completely contrary to the advice that was given by officers throughout the collaborative preparation of the amendment material days before council night so before making a decision on whether amendment C 143 sorry it should remain parked at the traffic lights until a structure plan is prepared we would first ask Council to consider the following benefits of allowing to proceed first first supporting amendments e 143 143 will cost council very little as it is being carried out as a privately run planning scheme amendment this means the proponent fears 143 will quickly provide a much-needed 3.1 year boost to Linda no shrinking supply of viable residential land Michels escarpment land is already connected to all service utilities and with its views over the Mitchell River Valley represents an immediately developable viable residential site third the additional rates revenue that will flow from the rezoning of Michael 's land and its eventual development with around 10 residential blocks will fund the preparation of a structure plan for Linda know within the space of four to five years so when viewed rationally amendment C 143 represents a win-win for council whereas adopting the officers recommendation will cost assures ratepayers a lot of money up front only to that delay the same inevitable outcome for Michael and Michael 's escarpment land by many years in summing up amendment C 143 was given a green light by everyone involved for 10 months as it was deemed appropriate from both a regulatory and a town planning perspective the last minute suggestion from different council officers that it should be delayed until a structure plans prepared well both place in the media but cost burden anomaly will not change the eventual outcome for this land in any way whereas allowing amendments C 143 to proceed will allow Linda note to grow for an additional 3.1 years in a sustainable logical and orderly fashion with negligible cost to ratepayers on that note I 'd like to thank Council he these submissions and invite questions through the chat Thank You mr. okay is it true that the the abutting land around the applicants the proponents land is zoned township there is some there are pockets of Township land so I 'm there here since I 'm farming his own land yep was the speaker 's comment correct in what he said in regards to the bordering properties I mean I I understand that the the land immediately behind it on the flats is farming but are the other bordering properties are they township there are some pockets of Township land in sort of jutting into the property and adjacent to the property but there 's also farming zone land the body I think well at the back on the side but my understanding is that only the and not further back than then about the depth of the house side and some of that land from my inspection on the day I went out there is actually being used for growing councils just a clarification could can you remind me again how long ago you made your first application and to whom you made that application Thank You counselor we approached camper sorry we approached Council in May last year we were assigned the author of the council report Elaine wood the senior strategic planner is that contact and we work with the line on it up until we were approached by the council offices any other questions councils cancel to you yeah Chris in regards to the surrounding land and Kate I do know this area as as you pointed out Chris it is it does have I 'm not sure the zone but Kate the farming that is happening down the left-hand side of this property is is only on a very small property and those people are related to the people that are on the flats so that 's only a very very small is surrounded by if not Township zone very very small properties there is a tiny a little bit on the on the the the north western boundary that is farm zone but the rest I would suggest is you say the township or very small properties I 'm happy happy to be corrected I 'll get the map up at my understanding is that there 's no Township zone beyond the back of the smaller Lots that front main road and there are some smaller Lots there that are in the farming zone that 's my recollection council Buckland yeah the simple one here it says that the council does not support the request to rezone okay if we refuse this what 's the next move does the applicant have to reapply again and we had us how does it all work did you have a question okay well whoever wants to answer did this currently there 's no motion well what 's this recommendation then we 've got a vote on the recommendation that it 's a motion in itself counselor Ellis could you when idea mr. mayor if 'm happy to move them for particular motion at this time which may assist councillor Buckley and in these understanding sorry we have another big apartment yeah just just a while I 'm full cat I I fought one of my tension to move emotion just me thank you and I 'll speak to Council that I just wanted to understand the risk of what it would be to the applicant if you had to wait 12 months or to use for the structure plan to be completed thank you through the chair I 'm glad I was I say question actually because it 's gonna take a little bit longer ahead in five minutes to go through this thank you say for example we take the optimistic representations in the council report set council spend 65,000 and in a year 's time we 're back here and Linda there 's a Linda no structure plan in front of us for council to consider and it 's been exhibited to the people of lumen a now given the someone 's gonna come down from Melbourne write this report up and say look at the Main Street of this town look at Main Street that should be residential or commercial or what-have-you so this structure plan is going to say resign the the north side of Main Street Linda no and they 'll go out into the public someone from Ballmer farms will be on the phone to counsel the next day and say what 's that gonna do to my rights and the answer is gonna be put a zero on the end of it so anyway we we roll up counselor says yep but that 's a good idea nonetheless we roll up back here we 're back here in a year 's time we 've got the same application ahead the structure plan says that land should go into the general residential zone the township zone that 's old general residential zone so we roll up and say we want to resign this land general residential and someone 's gonna say but all the way around it 's still on the township zone you can 't just have one general residential zone blocking the whole oh Linda so get knocked back until someone 's willing to take on that task of rezoning the entire north side of the main road there 'll be someone at this council with the letters Q CR for their name I 'm saying everyday arid our dead body we 've just put all this money into this farm you 're not putting a zero on the end of our rates and I hope you just stick to okay sorry okay liberating a bit okay it 's gonna take a long time it 's gonna be a big expensive fight for Council to rezone Linda now even with a structure plan this amendment to the township zone works now as a site-specific rezoning because it 's effectively an anomaly it doesn 't become an anomaly if this if we try to resign under a structure plan to the general residential zone we 're putting into the same zone as everything else England that oh it 's an anomaly so therefore it 's a lot easier to do it now we 'll be waiting six years at least before Council could get something like that you your viable land supplying linen oak has shrunk to zero thanks Chris um Michael would you like to come forward Thank You mr. made I just like to probably start at the top of the paperwork you have in front of you at five point two point two we 're not asking for subdivision rezoning and subdivision saying here we 're only asking for a rezoning I already have two three Lots and three zonings what we 're asking for now is to lots and to zonings so quite simply I just want the escarpment top of the escarpment to be sound residential the rest of my property will go back to farming we 've agreed with Elaine you 'll have a met with your notes there that 'll have a bit of a green patch on the pink then there 's another bit that was an anomaly I believe as it was quite clearly stated here once upon a time but land was zoned from the river up to the no dog a road as farming I 'd suggest somewhere about 9th 1999 when Matthew God changed a escarpment became a different zoning to what it was it was a when we were looking at it that left a part of the escarpment steep I can assure you not quite 90 degrees by far short a strip of land just in under the hill that was going to be a different zoning we agreed with Elaine and I said that we would amalgamate that all with the one of the other two titles of on the flat and have zoning for the gallon the flat a 4 up on the hill which I 'd like to see is residential on all the times I 've set around a table similar to this I 've never seen a monetary point put up its rezoning as Chris just said I think congratulations great it 's a good way to start to try to get it done I think the viewers councils that came on board just recently the wanna see change there 's a flaw in the planning the strategic planners without being too cruel possibly haven 't_''_5067.19 been doing their job particularly well why is it now I think application triggers a whole rezoning of a town there 's been other reasonings happen in the town that haven 't triggered it and why haven 't kept society planners I was on the council I was asking for them to look at them to know why is it now that they want the Holub we know when I put up an area that I don 't believe can do anything else but be cool boy wasn 't it looked at when you 're on council then you had your own council they I did put it up and it was never was just pushed one side Mac so I 've been trying to get Linda no moving I believe Lynn and I will go ahead I believe is need there now for more land for residential council has approved a a boarding house already talking to with the owners of Zen CG they 've said that people there would like to live in the know and they are looking for blocks that have views they 're not looking to build out on the pre-campaign further back but where it 's up no I asked why hasn 't it happened before and as a council as councils you should be now looking making sure there 's money in the budget for town-planning likes Melaku marlow they should be said we shouldn 't be catching up we should be for bus we shouldn 't be on a catch up we should be leading the way thank you thanks more question council pearls the attachments needs to be a road down to the flats if this is to go here there seems to be a road or a billy goat track that goes down on attachment number page three of the attachments and wondering whether sorry my comment my comment wasn 't so much about a physical road but a road frontage so a legal frontage to a road that that track is just a track on the property it 's not a road every like that is created has to have legal road frontage council just the far right-hand part of that property actually about the dagger road the right into Linden so the yes that and that 's why that 's there is a subdivision here it 's you know it 's a technical thing the subdivision is not the question not a question in this case but if the rezoning went ahead and the light was created on the escarpment then to provide access to both Lots that extend down to the flat the proposals been put that they should be consolidated so that they have furnish to erode otherwise a lot to the west would not have direct access to a road it 's at the moment its frontage is through the parcel of land that we 're talking about being Township fronting main road yes so if we if we to create this Township zone on this tangent zone a lot on the escarpment then it prevents one of those Lots on the flights getting frontage to a road unless it 's consolidated it would just provide it with legal access it 's legal and practical access off of Maine 's Maynard councillor Roberts your question I think it was covered mr. mayor thank you council what yes mr. mayor I planted two questions for Michael but he still answer from from the gallery I 'll get Michael to come back up the first question Michael was just to actually clarify this access because knowing the your property there I believe your River flat has access to the Duggar road without being part of the escarpment and the other question is in speaking with planners they advise that if you go this go alone on this that it would be quite a costly exercise for yourself and it may not succeed but my question to you is um you 're prepared to take that risk are you thank you I think you 've missed my point I have two lights now I intend to amalgamate remain with to having one lot on the escarpment and the rest of thing the second lot so I will be amalgamating basically you can say my flat countries to one title it has it has access to the Chicago and I been inside and I go right well I unless I get objections I believe there shouldn 't be a lot more of spent bit now there shouldn 't be a lot next sort of process if I get objections I believe the could go to a panel Craigslist in the old pen so I could help encourage mr. freshwater it 's been brought put to us that there will be some considerable costs associated with this application on behalf of any applicant in this matter are you cogs another that are you aware of that effect that they could be extra costs I can 't believe there be a lot more cost unless there 's objections I 've got a cable panel thanks Michael Council to II would like to ask you a question Michael the access to to the river flats whereabouts is that at the foot of the hill on the eastern side as you go down on the wet counselor to e there 's a gateway there hundred years okay I 'm so I 'm looking at just Google Maps and it shows the property your property going down and then there 's skull creek covers your property behind your house and then a property to the right closer to being star so is that the access that track there now that is used way with trucks and tractors everyone go in and it runs along under the foot of the hill and goes across a bridge that we have there that is the access to the flat there is scale correctly I have two titles that 's 20 chain wide that block all together with two titles there okay so that but the the suggestion so you 're what you 're saying is the access actually goes through what would be if if this gets approved this rezoning there would be the access would go through the area that would be rezone two townships owners are oh no no the top of the escarpment we presidential zone and the rest of the property will be farming zone I 'm still struggling to see where the access Michael these to that to that farm zone yet at the foot of the hill at window no you go in immediately there 's a gate there is is part of that same title of land behind you it will be it will be thank you thanks Michael any further questions a comment about the horticultural or the farming business next door my concerns in being involved with site-specific rezoning that pressure can come on from residential areas on to businesses and operating so they could potentially be some issues they view got a feel for it oh no I 'm happy to provide a response to a range of things and introduced the item if you would like me to but looking at the designing map there are substantial areas of farming zoned land abutting this property there 's there 's you know most of the western boundary is Township sorry it 's farming zone as all the land to the north and further to the west the farming zone gives the landowner the right to farm that land and the residential amenity of those properties is different to being in a Township or residential zone so yes that 's this part of the reason why we have zones is to create that distinction between the different land uses so that you can manage the impact between the two there 's a I think a misunderstanding of what 's intended it doesn 't mean we 're going to rezone the whole of Linda no but it will give some indication of how land should be raised owned over time in Linda know it gives everybody some better understanding of what they can expect to happen around them over time whereas right now there 's you know little bits of Township zone dotted along main road significant areas of farming zone which is used for farming and what we 're saying is we need to have a conversation with the community and the landowners to actually understand the what the future should look like and over what time that that might be achieved but I 'm happy to introduce the item so that council can then debate it if you 'd like me to to do that I 'm happy I 'm happy to answer other questions Michael mentioned our vibrant Linda no is and certainly in the last or past six years has been a consolidation of certain properties where we now have six of the top national solid producers out of that Linda no Valley and the other two to municipalities are providing eight of the top ten seller producers so it is a significant thing that we need Sidda that important horticultural area that 's my only concern I don 't disagree with here we need to tidy up the zones but my concern is around the industry that 's out there now any further questions councils if there 's none mr. Muir I 'm okay for yeah so I thought I heard you say you concluded I 'm sorry oh I do apologize and we don 't have the introduction of the item now and if there 's any further questions we yeah so we had two people that wish to speak to the item they 've done that yeah and protocol is that we get the odd and introduced very much aware of it on just miss misheard Kate and I would not take any opportunity for her to speak away thank you I think it is quite important that the officers perspective be put on this item given we 've heard the submissions that we have and while to the applicant this may appear to that that 's not the case and the distinction really is that we are saying it 's not just this question is about more than this parcel of land where the applicant is seeing it as just purely about his parcel of land he 's wanting to view it as an anomaly as not being Township and I disagree quite strongly about that in terms of the current zoning layout and council in considering this matter is wearing the Hat of the planning authority so it means we have a responsibility to provide sound strategy about the way that we plan for the future of towns and the way that we implement that through the planning scheme to provide landowners with good understanding about how the town they live in will be used and land will be developed and what what current and future rights landowners might have to actually be developers as well so the role is the planning authority is really important because we need to actually be forecasting what economic forecasting and understanding what economic social and environmental issues are being experienced by the community and how is made to what 's happening in Linden oh and the importance of the agricultural industry the way some of those land-use practices are changing they 're examples of reasons why we have a responsibility to actually understand how are we providing for both agricultural and Township development in this part of the Shire so understanding that broader level of need to plan means that good practice is that we would develop a broad strategy for the town now there 's been some preliminary work done which provides some level of guidance but that hasn 't been discussed in detail with the community and it hasn 't been adopted by council and some of the work through the peer review that we undertook revealed some anomalies in that work at the time so that needs to be revisited it doesn 't mean that we will rezone the whole town and that farmers will be paying rates on residential zone property that would be something that we would attempt to avoid we would give people some level of certainty about we would talk with landowners and the community about how that is needed to be filled over time I think it 's a misguided view that the cost imposter Council to actually do strategic planning is wasted money that 's not not the case at all what it does is actually enable council to make sure that the way that we develop land can most effectively provide for residential environments and other environments that residents want it means that we can actually do that in a planned way rather than responding to ad hoc need to upgrade infrastructure or change the way think about land and how it might be developed to make sure that it doesn 't happen in an ad hoc way where there 's not connected roads and open space and the other things that actually need to support growing communities and Linda know is going to be one of those and then it needs to be some put into that so what we 're suggesting here is that that step needs to happen before we actually play they 'll do any work with these the planning rules and the zoning of land inland and I so we so that there is there is that ability to understand what does it mean to rezone this particular parcel of land when it comes to further development I guess what we 're saying is whether whether you do it now or later you 're going to have to do we 're going to have to do this piece of work and if we were to proceed with us site-specific zoning at this location in the absence of that then it will be very difficult to undertake to prevent other future ad hoc reasonings happening in that in that town that the lack of strategy will make it very difficult to pull that back because we will be setting a precedent with that I think there are some risks other risks to council for doing a site-specific amendment is if it is pursued in the absence of appropriately resolved strategic planning framework and one of those is a real a real risk that there 's a lack of community understanding and confidence in respect to councils future intentions for the development of Linda Linda know and support of that agricultural industry most effectively development outcome overall for Linda no it 's the the use of the township zone in Linda know may or may not be the right zone the Township zones a very flexible residential zone that allows all sorts of other uses to happen it allows subdivision down to quite low residential densities and I think there needs to be a discussion with that community and the landowners about the development outcomes that we would like to see happening Linda no to meet the demand that is likely to be sought there and importantly there are risks to the proponent if that work has not been done any good planning process to amend the planning scheme because of the rigor of the process that we put applicants through will ask for this strategic justification this is not an anomaly this is a request to rezone the land and it 's a request to rezone land that will generate questions about what really is council looking to achieve in Lindon oh and I suspect that any landowner who has concern and concerns about it any the minister and any planning suggesting need to be answered before we can undertake this work this is not a budget gouge this is being transparent with council about the costs that will be incurred if we are to proceed with this work as a matter of urgency all I 'm doing is being transparent about the cost and also for the proponent the likely process that 's why it 's included in the recommendation yes it is unusual but it 's about being transparent about that process there are things in the report that the applicant agrees and disagrees with it 's a balanced report we 've tried to present the case as it appears and yes officers were you know initially thinking that maybe there was you know you could form the view that you could do this as a site-specific amendment but on balance and looking at all of the issues and the strategic justification that 's required and the potential implications for Linda know then my clear recommendation and I 've made this very clear to the applicants and their representatives that I don 't believe this is the right way maybe enough but I 'm happy to answer questions if there are anything if there are any thanks in part just answered it mr. Nelson but it was more in relation to this information being conveyed to the proponent at the beginning of the application and why did it take so long to form that view and then I only come to what six weeks ago instead that conversation would have been better had at the start yeah look look that may well be the case planning is not an exact science it 's a on balance how do you know what 's the most appropriate approach what 's the most strategic approach planners will often form different views about how things should proceed because with most planning issues everyone can have a view it 's not the same as mr. Waits deals with bridges bridges either are going to stand up or they 're not planning questions are much more complicated than that and there 's always a process at the beginning of these these requests to actually work through and understand what the best approach won 't actually 't make the decision about planning scheme amendments only the council does there is no delegated authority to give the green light to anything and so until it ends up here at the council chamber and until council makes a decision there 's no green line but essentially that will given the sort of the view that things would progress fairly smoothly up until about six weeks ago yeah I 'm not denying that that view may have been put but as soon as it became clear to me that it wasn 't the most appropriate approach to take that it puts both Council and the applicant risk then I I took action to make that clear to all everybody involved and the report that 's been prepared I think demonstrates that there 's merit in sticking to good planning process in this case for the benefit of counsel and the proponent ultimately if we 're going to be successful at achieving a better understanding of what this land should be rezone is it Township is it something else what 's the density how does the road network connect what about developer contributions there are a whole range of questions that will be avoided if this parcel of land is raised owned and which it will be difficult potentially to regain if on other properties if we don 't take this strategic step at this point in time cut in in your information that you 've supplied us in regards to showing some context a couple of pages in refers to the 2012 planning scheme amendment which happened to me my property and further in that in that paragraph it says the panel noted that what the recommendation was to approve the rezoning on the basis of the small size of site relatively minor impacts and policy that is not as clear as it could be that is one of my questions has that policy changed or is it still ambiguous as it was and it does refer to that the last part of that the sentence in regards to further rezoning of the township or sorry that the decision made back then should not be seen as a precedent for significant further rezoning of the Township zone or to on its merits so I gather this is the process of reviewing it on its merits and my question in regards to that policy that was not as clear as it could have been back then has it been changed and if so how is that been changed my reading of the independent panel 's report was that the the way that counsel presented this the rate you 're rezoning was on the basis that there would be significant impact to surrounding agricultural land users and we had objections at that time the panel formed the view that on the basis of the scale of the amendment involved that that significant impact couldn 't_''_6655.09 be demonstrated and that as a one-off amendment they were prepared to support that despite counsel not supporting it at the time so know that that policy hasn 't substantially changed that 's that 's the issue that the Mayor was talking about about the interaction between farming and residential users and we we have in Linda know a situation where there is there are house lights in dotted in farming zone so that that lack that says that we should specifically raise own land or change that zone it 's just the historical pattern at the moment what the what the panel did say was that in effect it should not be seen as a precedent for further rezoning to the town and what I 'm saying is that this parcel represents the start of set the precedent for what will be significant pressure to understand how the balance of this area should be rezoned so what I 'm saying is don 't set a further precedent with a site specific amendment do the planning work to understand how the land should be raised owned am I making that if I could maybe just perhaps make a comment in regards to the amount of land that a base farming land to be honest my block of land there but small farming land now than this proposal here now so in regards to that if if for argument 's sake any of the the houses that have farmland abutting them behind them are next to them what would what would be the case if one of in regards to farming activity how would that work well if if a Township zone oh no complain to counsel about farming activity happening on the farm zone there 's probably very little that we would do about that but in a practical sense on the ground there would be pressure exerted by one or other landowners about about the actual activities there so it can become quite a significant neighborhood dispute the council may or may not be able to intervene in depending on what the what the complaint is you 'll see that there are sure if you 're looking at the layout there but there 's quite a number of small lights there are some small lights in the farming zone and already what you can see is a pattern of subdivision that 's quite ad hoc and quite opportunistic providing getting access directly from the main road so there 's pretty much nothing that really needs to be done to service those Lots and what we 're saying really is if we let each of these Lots develop on a site by site basis setting a of land here then what you will get is more of that ad hoc subdivision and rezoning happening here and I don 't think that 's a good use of Service land or land that is appropriate for farming depending on how that how the strategic assessment works out don 't think that 's a good way to see the town develop what you 'll get is caught by old-style subdivisions in each of those parcels and there won 't be the ability to provide connectivity between that part of town Allah should come out on to Main Road and go back in and I 'm using that as a basic example but it doesn 't allow if we if we just say look this is an anomaly and let 's just resume this Township and then the next one along is no different it 's got you know Township zoning all along the front of it is that an anomaly and we 'll just let that happen as well I 'm saying just take a step back and have a look at how we should actually allow this area the type of lights that people in Linden ou are looking for we need to understand that and how we create the right residential amenity because it is a slightly unusual and potentially sensitive area overlooking the the escarpment some parts at least how do you create the right environment the way you do that is to have a look at it with the landowners in the community and then you look at what the planning scheme should do to support that councillor what you had a question thanks mr. mee um ok the the rest of the street all the way down to the old garage is either residential blocks majority exists or it is being utilized or vegetable growing so if you said that it was going to be ad hoc they 're already they already exist and obviously boomers who are vegetable growers in that area have no intentions wanting to push for subdivision along there so in other words the only piece left is Michels the rest of the rest of it would remind as as it is until such time as illness thought that perhaps of the escarpment would be would be nice in build interlocks well that 's something that we would need to explore with the landowners and with the community and you know understand understand what the future land-use you know the most appropriate future land-use is in Lyndon oh I think you know we can 't make assumptions about that that 's that 's something that we need to understand and yes designing pattern at the moment reflects the actual land use it doesn 't reflect what a future land-use pattern like might apply I don 't know what the Balmer 's view would be of gradually more Township zoning being provided in this part of town that 's not something that 's been discussed it 's going to further questions council pearls point five it says before he works commits on site I see all rural crossover design must be submitted to and approved by the responsible Authority it 's on the last page that 's an example of a detail in a permit it 's that I was talking about before but I mentioned before that or I think this case the request is for a joint planning scheme amendment and planning permit process so as a normal part of the documentation we would prepare a draft planning permit which would be exhibited with the amendment documentation so that people would see if the subdivision precedes this is what the conditions are don 't obsess with the subdivision the subdivision is not the significant thing here where the access is what a lots are laid out like is is a minor consideration the the significant consideration here is rezoning all of that land to Township because that will be subject to further development I don 't the the way that the parcels of land are laid out in the titles I don 't_''_7133.12 I don 't mind how that happens it 's the rezoning to Township that 's the challenge further questions Thank You Elsa sorry no further questions no further questions so there for me I 'd like as I earlier foreshadowed I 'd like to move a motion before council do I have you all right yeah thank you sir what I 'd like to do is and approve the two lot subdivision planning permit and by doing such I would like to remove the following notion that council having considered all planning matters approved the draft documentation provided at appendix one an authorized as officers to one seek authorization from the Minister for planning to prepare a planning scheme amendment proposed amendment C 143 combined with the planning permit application to the East Gippsland planning scheme to rezone land at 28 main street Linda no being lot too on the Lord 's plan one double for one double eight and lot to on lodge plain double to double 179 m for Mary both in the parish of Google marine from farming zone schedule one to Township zone and farming zone scheduled for and consider a planning permit to subdivide the land into two lots to subject to authorization from the Minister for planning prepare and exhibit a combined planning permit and amendment proposed amendment C 143 to the East Gippsland planning scheme to dot point rezone the land at 28 ninth Street Linda know being lot on lods plan one double for one double a and nine m4 marry both in the Paris of boomerang from the farming zone schedule one two Township zone and farming zone scheduled for and docking subdivide the land at 28 Main Street Linda no being lot to on the lodge plane one double for one double aid and lot to on Lodge plane double to double one seven nine infirmary both in the parish of kou-kun boomerang such my notion sir speakers councils this has been quite a lengthy consideration mr. mayor and many considerations and issues of being put before council this evening I particularly like to thank miss Nelson for the considered report that you provided counsel to work through I 'd also like to thank you for their application to the matter before us the matter before us this evening deserves support members were counseled and I feel that it is an appropriate into that zone in Belinda no I can well recall actually counselor clerk to ease application some years ago with a similar lengthy debate took place I consider that the application is reasonable and therefore I recommend the motion to Council for adoption thank point of order please point is that there was an original recommendation that was put that we haven 't had a chance to discuss and I 'm wondering what order of those recommendations can be good and it hasn 't if I can respond to that mr. Mehra this this was the original motion the other notion was not put to council I I for shadow moving the particular motion and that I say is the tabled nation yeah yeah sorry no I I just didn 't feel I had an opportunity to put this motion as well I think it 's time for me to talk and you get to talk in a minute the point of what is no no council Reeves council pills Thank You mr. mee with regards to this application I don 't_''_7449.01 I feel the applicant has been unjustly ambushed by councils issue about the zoning of the township of Linden oh there 's a piece to me to be a sensible progressive upgrade to the Linda no Township and like our previous época councillor to II whose motion was moved in 2012 then to 1999 and it seems to be aging and I 'd say it 's probably something that council needs to address on its merit that we do actually need to schedule the Linda no structure plain into our costing to be addressed more sooner than later the bottom line here is with regards to the abutting blocks that actually about this property they are actually zoned in the township zone which is appropriate for this applicant to be able to proceed the bottom line that the farming section is being addressed is also taken into consideration and I feel that this applicant is being delayed in their process because of eternal counsel difficulties with regards to entertaining his request so with that remember that counsel well I actually believe that when we actually went ahead with the Linda no Township planning or back in 2012 that this had been addressed in and apparently it hasn 't been signed sealed and delivered and there 's an issue with the township we feel that basic all I feel basically we 've probably let the community down in that sense and it should that in order to address that we need to step up and be leaders and get our tanning planning department up to scratch with regards to what our community is going to be wanting into the future and I feel it 's a responsible decision and mindful of the Linda know horticultural industry and a sophisticate which is a sophisticated and complex component of our community I think it actually addresses the issue with regards to the farmland they 're the bottom line is the section that 's wanting the next council of freshwater wants to develop is actually rocky it 's on an in scarp Minh basically the bottom line is it is land it won 't be used for farming and it 's an appropriate development for it and that 's the thanks councils speakers against yeah thanks mr. Muir look I 'm gonna be disappointed I 've thought that some of those comments then unnecessary potshots so they are planning officers and you know I hope that they are not taken in the context of maybe a simplistic language I think a key our council officers work breath councilors and I urge you to do so planning is a complex and it 's also an iterative process which is a big word iterative means that it 's a to and fro that somebody with a proponent will come they 'll start a process have a discussion and the good thing about an iterative process is as the proponents planning intentions emerge it may become apparent that what is proposed or is emerging to a pro 's proposed may not sit in comfortably with what the planning process and the planners think is appropriate and I think it 's good I think it 's good that there are checks and balances and gateways that proponents progress through especially in significant developments like this or changes ad hoc changes like this where somebody can say hang on a second this is sitting outside our remit and we need to take this to counseling I think that 's important so I I commend the council offices for the work they 've done and for bringing it to us and everybody in the Shire should be grateful for that some people process but planning process is the key here that 's the thing I 'm not sure that there 's a diminished supply of land in Lynda know what I am sure of is the linden arc is a vibrant and emerging and developing township with a variety of competing uses farming transport a cafe culture and manufacturing culture a residential culture a school culture all of these things are there competing when you have those multiple uses and you start to allow ad hoc development you will run into problems counselors and we counselors have been for years dealing with legacy developments that have happened and it takes years to retrieve them it takes years and I urge you to stop and look at the original recommendation the original recommendation doesn 't say it 's not going to happen it says let 's stop and put a plan around this so that when it does happen it takes into consideration all those vibrant new uses that are emerging for town like Linda know and hopefully will happen in August and it is happening in Lakes Entrance it 's happening in but if we put some proper planning around this it will probably take about the same time as the proponent is going to have by taking this to a minister a planning panel it won 't be any slower but what it will do is it will create certainty for him and other potential developers and probably increase the value of his land because it won 't be ad hoc and it won 't be subject to ad hoc objections in future it will put certainty around it it 's so important I urge you to exercise caution and we need to consult the communities in regard to any matters regarding zoning and that I believe hasn 't been done and if there 's a changed view of the use and strategic intentions of Linda no we haven 't tested that yet and we haven 't heard that and to have a one-off application in an ad hoc manner it doesn 't take into account the other side of planning which is the community benefit and I think we need to stop and consider that councillors supporting it whole planning anomalies and we will be dealing with them and I believe you will be dealing with them here councillors you had a lot of colorful presentations emotive presentations and also some sidetracks the basic matter here is planning an ordered organize planning if you really care about Linda know if you really care about the proponents potential to assist Linda no stop don 't vote for this recommendation go back to the original one which puts structure order organizational rated and yes we 're not we 're not providing money for the planning department just ad hoc we are now seeing that Linda know is emerging for those variety of uses that I just described and we can invest some time in it and invest some money in it and getting it right let 's do it once let 's do it right otherwise it 'll be back here in a couple of years time there 'll be another long debate there 'll be another individual proponent and it sets a dangerous precedent it really does counselors vote against that and I recommend the original motion that is on the motion there 's no further speakers I will put the motion all those in favor oh sorry councilors you 're quite right right of reply Thank You mr. mee what words will be fairly quick and first of all I 'd like to acknowledge councilor is eloquent argument against what I continue to be an on ad hoc application to council it 's a logical consequence of although many decades of planning leading to the town creations a township of Linda know the points that he made in relation to appropriate strategic planning is valid and it is an action that I would be encouraging councillors to support both counts the reason I inning in approaching the offices to commence the concept of a strategic plan we need to be considered about what takes priority over the other areas within our show but it is certainly something that this is a catalyst in fact this is what this application is it 's a catalyst for consideration to council perhaps a wake-up call for us to say we haven 't addressed a growing area we need to do something about it application at that area of Linda know and it 's growing economic benefits to our wider community the points also made in relation to the appreciation of council offices is endorsed by myself I do appreciate the hard work and I do particularly appreciate the considered argument put by mr. Nelson in relation to this matter and her colleagues I also appreciate the degree of consideration that the applicant had brought to us here this evening the the lengthened debate has simply just provided us with an opportunity to make an approach and considered decision and that is lady ladies and gentlemen to vote in the affirmative for this motion so I think he Thank You counselor Ellis I 'll now put the motion all those in favor against motions carried yes you need a break if you need a break if you 'd like a five-minute break you can _"

Holton would you like to respond yeah I have very happy to respond to the jetty in question where my boat is currently located within the marina me kangaroo no he 's not it is unrestricted the reason it is there and I advise councils marina officer of the case is that it is requiring repairs which has rendered it inoperable and it cannot be move to the swing mooring which which which I have in the middle of Bancroft they as soon as the repairs are effected the boat will be removed back to its swing and and it 's a situation I 'd vote not to be in but I went through the appropriate education he 's an extended time Thank You mr.

Hyde and four is councillors report I 'd like to set the scene this week in relation to more around why we do things and why we get out rather than what we 've been doing each each month we table our reports which are therefore public to inspect at any time but I 'd like to start by talking about health and well-being and how we need to really look after each other in our community earlier this year there was a national outpouring of emotion and grief on the at the age of 14 this tragic death brought about by bullying shocked our nation our dolly was well known to our nation as she was the face of a kübra in response to this tragic death Dolly 's Dream Foundation has now been established the dollies Dream Foundation is a charity group established by family and friends of dolly Everett dolly was the victim of bullying and ended her own life at age 14 yeah I just still find that really hard to contemplate in remembrance of dolly and to facilitate positive change for other young young lives the dolly Foundation aims to provide support to charity groups through their fundraising and promotion sometimes these issues seem so big that we don 't know how to deal with them or how to start and a young lady a young business lady in our community right here Carlene I decided that her business could not only assist with donating to the foundation but also create awareness about bullying and talking about it and starting that conversation so for you that are not sure what she actually did Karly decided that would have the word and do it for Dolly Carlene Autzen is the initiative to raise funds for the dolly Dream Foundation has resulted in over seven hundred orders from all over Australia for this unique shirt embroidered with the door for dolly hashtag which aims to spread awareness of teenage bullying Carly said dolly was a young country girl who loved horses and horse riding Carly said she had a strong connection with dolly and enjoyed doing those sorts of things in her life growing up in the country being surrounded by horses and other animals and I just wanted to do something practical to raise awareness of bullying anxiety depression and youth suicide in just one month Carly 's initiative has raised ten thousand five hundred dollars for the foundation but just as important Carly 's initiative sorry yeah in just one month Carly 's initiative has raised ten thousand five hundred dollars for the foundation but just as important Carly 's initiative has raised local awareness around the bullying and other mental health issues and with your indulgence counselors I 'd like to show you one of back of the shirt it says hashtag speak even if your voice shakes hashtag stop bullying now and hashtag do [Applause] thank you I counsel to e by contrast mine 's fairly mundane all different functions during the course of the last month the one I would like to speak about was a business breakfast breakfast he skips land news which was very interesting to to see behind the scenes something that 's I know is a staple in my life every Friday reading the the local newspaper and as I say was very entertaining to see that from the from an inside perspective they 've been there for over a hundred years owned continuously or the Yates family and the the changes they explain some of the changes that that that business has been through over 100 years and you can imagine that it started off as a fairly simple operation from using hot metal production what they referred to as hot metal production to produce newspapers down to nowadays using obviously computers and computer to plate technology sorry I don 't even understand some of these terms and to actually see the print press is running and actually printing off that day 's newspaper that we that we read once it was once it was produced so a very good event for me to attend particularly with other businesses or business owners and to to speak to them about the issues that they see and face every day so it was well worth attending thank you sorry counselor I call mr. mayor I 've been working on a few things in the last month but one of the things that I want to talk about tonight is some work that I 've been doing with a group of committed and passionate I mean our residents who have formed with the concept of retaining the homeostatic view a Hall which was also the former kindergarten the CWA is a really historic building and probably not many know that it was built in 1873 and was the original Catholic Church in Armijo which was built during you know busy times and it was built to handle the capacity of the growing population in recent times over the last 40 years facility has since been built in town and the CWA Hall is now empty so the group have formed with the concept that would create and develop a community hub or Center which utilizes this historic building and by preserving and maintaining this building in public hands it 's going to be then able to be used by all in the community for a range of activities the community crew have been liaising with the local CWA branch in regards to the proposal and a number of other organizations in support of this proposal is extremely important to preserve our heritage buildings not only as a reminder to our future generations but also currently of the historic value of the life and times of our past in our high country town I 've been working on a few other things but they 're in my written report which through thank you thanks counselor O 'Connell Council Reeves thanks mr. mayor thanks mr. man councillors members of the gallery it 's nice to hear about omiyo kindergarten and the hall the CWA hall my children went to kindergarten there and for or not my report is is submitted but I 'd like to raise one point and this is not so much what has happened but what will happen on Thursday this day 's International Women 's Day I saw it 's International Women 's Day and why is it important so I 'm glad that you mentioned the Y 's around our reports mr. mayor well why is it important we stop and pay homage may we all be reminded of the importance of civil awareness around International Women 's Day maybe what we reminded about women and girls equality about anti-sexism about anti-discrimination and about the elimination of misogyny among other things now some people call those things being PC or politically correct there 's the father of a young woman who I know will be a leader as a principal of a school with fifty percent population girls I want their lives to be free of these impediments that they do say exist now I 'd like to see a timer we don 't have to have women leaders we have leaders and I 'd like to see Australia but it 's 50 percent or more and if that 's being PC well bring it on I 'm a subscriber to it so with those words 8 through March this Thursday International Women 's Day stop and think for a moment why it 's important thanks counsellors thanks counselor Reeves councillor Roberts Thank You mr. mayor something really brief from me most of my points have been already but I would like to I had the chance to visit the proposed line a little oil mineral signs sands mine site the other week and I know a lot of other councillors have already been out there but I um I 'd made it out after a bit of trouble finding each other we I managed to meet up with some people and no it was a really valuable experience to gain a boots-on-the-ground approach at the post site and to gain a first-hand understanding of the land and terrain and I know definitely open my eyes a lot to the situation and provided insight and it 's something that you can 't get from satellite pictures and so to have a little I found it really eye-opening taking a lot away from so thanks counsel Roberts counsel Buckley Thank You mr. I went to a dog our last Sunday historical for like Christmas party I don 't mean for one minute that we use the grant money for the Christmas the Kindred Historical Society 's a Dargo army O 'Hara twill currently host I go have done a splendid job with the historical interest and also the whole house even the unisex toilets are being kept in a very good condition thank you Thank You counsel Buckley cancer Ellis Thank You mr. mayor report just a couple of Meadows I 'll mention I would like to promote Yeah right okay during February ended a number of events including the Floyd activities lane and all of those associated with the flame projects traveling in company with the mayor councillors white and Phelps and co2 busselton Western Australia where we inspected numerous sites associated with the sand mining industry and in addition to those inspections we took part in a number of discussions in relation to government matters associated coastal secrets from the Melaku and I further met with a number of Melaku citizens series of ins issues I have a written report Thank You counsel why yeah just a few things from me mainly visit to West Australia which was most beneficial related to to this morning one of the eye-openers was just busselton ins also and something that was most enjoyable the other way we can cruise on the lady Nelson was partly cruise sailing uh des was running well I think you cancel what cancel pills to me I put a rather lengthy one because I just touching on marks sorry I 'm on e steering you all anyway you like a part of it anyway the summer period has continued to be a busy period for us counselors with a lot of background work I 'm happening behind the scenes for the trip to busselton NWA was well worth its while giving those who participated a better understanding of how these big mineral sands mining companies operate from from my basic perspective and if they get the go-ahead it isn 't up to the mining company the owners and themselves councils only role is to assess wear and tear on the road infrastructure instead learning community issues which may arrive the mineral sands of W a which we visited has been operating for close to 50 years and it is a big part of their everyday life so um you know we said in mind I thought it was a really interesting perspective to have been out to Glenelg a deal to be amongst the people out there I 'm to see where it 's going to be in Tahiti and then to travel over to W a and then hear the other side of it and view the other side of it the whole perspective comes together so um it also followed on with a bit of information from the from the state 's meeting which I 'll now talk about our quarterly seats meeting was this time with some very interesting presentations from Nick Murray from ports Victoria and about fairies Beach and another presentation from Michael Knowles and luyties Mundy from logistics who actually spoke about logistics logistics have purchased the old land I mean down in the South Gippsland area now Qube logistics actually manages the port in Bunbury where all the mineral sands are exported out of they actually gave us a presentation on these cubes that they actually mentally well they say contaminates goods so they put the product straight into these containers completely opened up and no need or no area of contamination whatsoever and it closed the it closed the logistical side for me that I 'm everything was being addressed there 'd be no no area for you no particles to be escaping from the transport side Mark Burnett is retiring from his role on seats as the treasurer and the role has been passed on to Shannon little from the Trobe and seats is written a lovely thank you letter to mark for his contribution to the role of we also had presentations from John earnest on safety freight networks and France and Peter Francis on the Phillip Island ferry project they both had presentations that were very interesting and I offered in jest to give them our ferry and tell them that they actually didn remember when I was a child they actually sank from a stings to Phillip Island so with that he barn I then moved on to the mov transport infrastructure meeting which was in Melbourne we had just lost our executive officer kevin PG who will be great well as transporting infrastructure and the rumor has it the cabins taken up a position in Canberra and I 'm not sure whether it 's with he 'll be very comfortable up there with his background that he actually has we had a presentation from Jeremy handling who is manager for active transport Victoria and he presented on the Victorian cycling strategy 2018 to 28 and the comments were that only 17% of the population we 're likely to ride a bike the perception by most is that it 's too dangerous but on the positive side we had health benefits less traffic congestion and more education training is needed and cycle lockers are also needed to be installed in main business areas government was hoping that local councils would take up the lead role on these encourage their communities to get involved was disappointing for rule our areas it was said that none of the hundred dollar TAC money was spent on box we were disappointed we then had a presentation I 'm Ashley cook who is the manager will regularly policy for transport Victoria and Julie Van Dyne who was the principal lawyer gave us a rundown on the workings that is behind your autonomous vehicles and the laws and regulations that will be needed actually come from a federal government level so big roads will be in the position to grab they 're working on these there are any draft copies but roads will be nation so as the vehicle can be used the autonomous be your cool it will be the regularly format that the owner needs to abide by I will also cover the insurance permits will be granted subject to conditions such as Road and weather and Roseville license key routes for companies to use so the news with other councils they said that they have been approached by companies in regards to flexi cars because they have those those yellow bikes the O bikes in there up from the O bike is the flexi car so they are yep on your phone scan the hand all as such and open up the B leave it at the airport some another skin another issue that some of the Melbourne councils are having the next doclist motorcycles or scooters like in Singapore and all the Asian companies knocking on their door wanting to drop all these vehicles on their doorstep but the issues to have some kind of Memorandum of Understanding in place suitable for them to where they 're leaving them they 're just dumping them what a concern convoy for kids was on was at rent which was on Saturday was a transporter issue which was held to raise money and funds for kids with cancer they 're only held every four years he was going towards camp quality and Angel Flight a trucks coming from the Tri Valley and trucks coming from the East High all meeting Lakes Entrance and they all stare so if you 're in the convoy and you 're a car they said that the drivers were very professional most people to see coming down the highway as it always is and they fully enjoy and then on the Sunday we had the Ben style Motorplex and it was very busy on the weekend it held a Burnout day on Saturday and on Sunday it had the truck drags and both events were of interest they had a lot of spectators and dregg 's was the first time that concludes my month in I 'm tired I have to say from it thank you Thank You counselor Pearl 's Kensal to you Thank You mr. mayor I just like to add something to Mary Ann 's suits report which was an issue that South Gippsland have had with truck accidents I think two years ago where they had 30 odd milk truck accidents predominantly milk tankers and boy by making some changes locally and including the drivers in in creating those changes the following year they had one accident

particular I just wanted to highlight that corn party it was good to know we also received the committee received a report in respect of the Victorian order to general citizens is the finding your respective East Gippsland which better also the committee was that there is going it 's been identified thank you Miss Bennet questions counselors well if there 's no questions ever move it for accepting me let 's move counselor pills second counselor to e these speakers put the motion yes counselor ease counselors and the very large gallery here should be reassured at how tenacious and assiduous the Audit Committee use and as a server was ultimately gagged and and I contribute it was important to have time spent there at that particular meeting and I certainly urge all counselors spared those order committee meetings you can get the time best the time it 's important to have that overview of what 's going on and for counsel to be reassured that there is that body that is tenaciously assiduously overviewing what 's going on there any further speakers I 'll put the motion or did you want to speak thanks in favor against that 's carried thank you so item five point three point three is a property acquisition and lease to Copic M limited to give those Streep and Ambra and we have Mr Cashman in attendance thank you thank you mister man so I 'm here today to present to you the report regarding the purchase of to give a street the name brand and the subsequent lease of that property to became limited so the banana school site located at to give a street was identified as surplus to the needs of the Department of Education and subsequently that was handed to the Department of Treasury and Finance for sale copper Kim limited who were the proponents of the stockmen mine project required a car park separate from the mine site to use as a transport interchange for workers in the mine Council considered that this site was of benefit to the mine and lobbied for this site to be included in an amendment to the East Gippsland planning scheme which was necessary to facilitate to facilitate the development of the mine this was successful and as under the first right of refusal process counsel had the opportunity to purchase this site at fifty percent of its market value based on the premise that the site would be used for community purposes offices of counsel put to the Department of Treasury and Finance a constructive argument in support of this to which they agreed this made the price of the site to council ninety thousand dollars it was important that given that we were still in discussions with copper cam limited that we had to firm up their lease agreement and key conditions of that lease so that the council wouldn 't be disadvantaged financially we didn 't want to be left with a parcel of land that hadn 't been tied to a firm lease agreement as such council officers undertook some negotiations with proponents of copper cam limited and we were successful in obtaining an agreement whereby the purchase price of ninety thousand dollars would subsequently be repaid over time by way of capital improvements to the facilities on the site the plan the capital improvement plan is yet to be devised but it will and primarily we will be looking at identifying the agent building works and addressing those promptly so given the agreement between both parties and the lease of conditions that were agreed to a council then notified the Department of Treasury and Finance of its intention to purchase the property at not for 90,000 so whilst there is this significant community aspect to this proposal the actual rent of the of the property to a commercial entity means that we had to undertake a market rental valuation as well and that 's in accordance with our own policy so in addition to the capital improvement plan whereby we will recoup of the purchase price of the land the site will also be generating some income for us which is currently set at five thousand five hundred dollars per annum including GST the initial term of the lease is for nine years with two five-year options available to the lessee so in accordance with section one nine zero of the Local Government Act we need to undertake a statutory public process to advertise the lease so as such I ask that council to give o street and endorsing officers to undertake the statutory lease requirements and subject to the public submission process that 's our line any questions maybe Mr Cashman for that update Council Robert 's you had your hand up a little bit unsure as to what copper CEM would not just purchase a property for the market value of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars when they 're gonna be paying council robbery had a follow-up question the the total revenue projected for the lease will quite 295,000 for 105 thousand four hundred dollars capital worse popper camera to undertake so it 's one hundred and four hundred and five thousand four hundred above the initial purchase cost do you believe this will be adequate to get the site to a safe workable condition can you compare the upkeep cost of similar there are some structures on the site that during the period do I know how much the trade that was saying there 's a trial I guess the negotiation that was the normal inversion maximize ability council buckley you had a question yes thank you mister me understand times you know a boy back from the 60s or 50s one morning with most of the time the lease has been unsold mostly for tax break for whatever mining company in my questions you did Gianaris have the mining company got all their requirement required permits out operating latest hunters follow-up cushion cancel book yeah yeah I 'll get follow that up beep well you 're telling me that even if the mine doesn 't go ahead that we won 't be stuck with a liability look we have been other things mention there but and it 'll be an asset anyway and it could be on sold to the next hunter if they don 't have a go you know for the ongoing system of technical experts for mining companies it won 't affect us in any way that way we 'll still get our money 's worth so to speak and yes it would become an asset of that long project the site is publicly owned and what we can 't go wrong on this one it seems obvious one thank you no guarantees in life really but no there are no there 's no we 're yet to determine exactly what those words would be efficient and really yes so there 'll be a process say further questions counsel to e out so counselor he 's moving the recommendation seeking a counselor white sorry just get clarification counsel Buckley were you second in that motion oh no he 's a recommendation okay so move the recommendations been moved by Councillor to H and seconded by Councillor Buckley yeah thank you speakers yeah look I think this is a great thing to do for the community up there I 'm probably the most averse to us increasing our public land but I do think the benefits far outweigh the the disadvantages in this particular case and it I think it also will give the local community up there a bit of a focal point that they they don 't necessarily have because we we don 't have any ownership of this land at all so council Buckley is a second would you like to speak oh I hope your predictions and casters somewhere near correct as a tricky issue for a long long time so we can only look forward to the best result thank you there any further speakers speaker against Council Roberts Thank You mr. mayor although I really do like the idea in principle and waiting for marks right of reply so I 'm sure it 'll be good I just feel like there 's too many unknowns in in costing repairs and maintenance and I believe this if we did retain this property it would be difficult to on sell I prefer to see similar or even greater funds committed to low low maintenance purpose-built community facility in the van Emperor area I think that would be a better deal in the long run it 's counselor Roberts these further speakers council white speaking for I would like to speak for the ocean I think it 's just it 's important in the future we may or in group file because the community thanks counsel what counsel pals speaking for all in that community buildings it 's for a long time now and for it to be stays in Council I 'm further speakers counselor Reeves speaking for sure look we do have a bit of a toehold up there we 've got else community of benamber have been shown to be amazing community members with the co-operative that 's running the store up at Vandenberg and took it over a number of years ago there 's a long history of good use and care of community assets look wow so ambitious to think that we could build up a brand new purpose-built facility it 's that 's not going to happen and we have a very beautiful heritage batsto designed so the government architect at the time Federation was best oh and that building is a great representation of he 's architecture at that particular time I think it 's ambitious to think counselor Pelt 's I 'd like to think that this is going to actually progress the stockmen mine it 's copper came now but I suspect that it might be a board decision somewhere in Southeast Asia and copper price that actually dictates whether they proceed however I 'm sure that the company will need these little pieces way we can further and improve social and economic benefits for our community of this particular project any further speakers so is that in is that an inn is that an indication that you would like to speak speaking for it councillor else speaking it 's a wind maintains a strong community footprint as time goes by you know asked Thank You counselor Ellis any further speakers counts right Connor look I just like taking care with my fellow colleagues this is a positive move for the benamber community and hopefully councillor pulses on the money and you know things might progressed but yes well done and it 's good work thank you so council I 'll give you the opportunity if you 'd like to close a debate but before I do that I 'd like to thank the staff negotiate on a negotiating on behalf of Council as we asked them to do that and I thank you very much I 'm just yeah just again a community facility that as I understand they do use it somewhat already hopefully it will be refurbished and and kept with out of it so I think that 's that 's a win for August HQ Flanders but the number of people particularly Thank You councillor II I 'll now put the motion all those in favor against you left your how I 'm up to lung cancer so we 'll just do that again for just for a bit of exercise all those in favor against thank you we items

councils are required to review their council plan each year under the Local Government Act the depth and scope of this review is a matter for each council to determine earlier this year councillors ended indicated general consensus that the organisation should prepare a revised plan having regard for any changes that may have occurred since the plan was adopted some nine months ago the draft revised plan has now been produced with important and guidance from councillors the executive group relevant business unit managers the changes to the plan can be summarized as follows data sources have been updated where more recent information was available capital works table has been revised to reflect the 2018-19 program some status updates have been made where obvious some light editing has been applied for readability clarity and style consistency and consideration has been given to whether any new strategies or plans have been adopted in the last 12 months so having reviewed the council plan as required under the Local Government Act Council is now in a position to release it to the recommendations before you will be happy to answer in English I think you used to read for questions counselors counselor Ellis said counselor pals has moved the recommendation there 's now a motion you 've got a seconder for counselor reefs speakers for the motion I just like to thank the staff for all their work that they 've put into this I know it 's a revision of our adopted plan but there 's always tweaking and I 'm fine combing of these particular things and I just like to thank them for their but they 're important and it 's our guidance to the backbone of what we actually do here and everything 's unit so I think it 's it 's good direction forward for us thank you Thank You counsel pals any further speakers counsel Buckley yeah I 'll be speaking against the emotion Thank You mr. mee yeah stand there it 's a plan with each other I want be supporting the budget this time around a couple of reasons I think we only need one capital improved value tax council plan Council bucket Oh have the recommendation in motion on the council plan is there any further speakers counselor Ellis just best clarified and we 're addressing the plane which leads forward into the future rather than the financial side of matters in relation to the management of counsel and I encourage members of the community to view our revised plan and make submissions if they feel we 've had any wrong with the wrong direction in relation to our activities thanks mister you thank you you can 't throw us any further speakers it 's not I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carried unanimously thank you so item three is the draft budget 2018-2019 adoption for public exhibition and we have miss Liz Collins in attendance Thank You Liz Thank You mr. mayor and councillors tonight before you is a recommendation in regards to the draft budget 2018 19 each year council is required to adopt a budget by the 30th of June and this is part of that statutory process this process will then allow the draft budget to be put out for public exhibition and submissions of information not only for the current year but also for a four year period both for operating and for capital projects the proposal in the draft budget before you tonight includes proposal for a rate increase of 2.25 percent in line with the Victorian Government rate cap you 'll see the waste collection charges are proposed to increased by four percent plus the 15 fixed component which will impart go towards covering that cost increased cost for the recyclable waste and user fees and charges generally on average increase by about 2.75 percent it also includes details of council 's capital works program which is set out at thirty eight point four million dollars as well as five point nine million dollars of landfill rehabilitation works the budget supports a range of operating initiatives for the forthcoming year continues to retire old debt maintained our existing service levels and enables Council to meet its obligations imposed on a boat and the victorian government in relation to management of waste services all within the imposed confines of the rate cap there is a recommendation before council tonight which includes a public notice on and in particular the proposal for the declaration of rates and charges when the final budget comes before council at the end of June this will tonight if council moves the motion this will then allow the draft budget to go on public exhibition for a period of four weeks and with that period closing on the 25th of May and then council will consider any submissions receive and the impact that that may have on the final budget so before you as I said is a recommendation for councils consideration thank you mr. Muir thank you Miss Collins questions councillors counselor Ellis it 's a very topical matter and something that we probably I don 't recall us discussing to add into your report to notice in relation to the increase of the 15 fall to make the recyclable collection issue increasing an increase and I perhaps think that we owe the public and explanation mr. Collins in relation to why this amount is being impostor or perhaps mr. weights might be the best in relation to this matter noting that we are increasing our collection fees average of 2.75 percent it 's not a criticism it 's just looking for an explanation thanks Council else mr. weights yes councillors the increase in the waste collection charge is directly related to the increased cost to council of providing recyclable services under the new regime where China are no longer taking recyclable material and that 's had an impact on the large firms that are the VG 's and the esteems who are accepting recycled materials that 's created an increased cost on their business and they 've passed that on directly to our contractor so if counsel is to try and recover that cost one of the ways and they 're the budget is that increase in the curbside collection charge which is a direct reflection of the increased cost passed on by our contractor and nothing more it 's to maintain status quo the other way of recovering extra cost is the introduction of the gate fee at transfer stations and landfills again for recyclable material which is not be charged Thank You counsel Roberts you had a question Thank You mr. Mann just to the rates notice or is this a a monthly or a pick up fee it 's a once-off for this financial year at this point in time we don 't know whether there will be a continuing increase passed on to our contractor and obviously in future budgets we will have the actual cost of recyclables management of those materials Thank You mr. weights any further questions councillors we do have a recommendation before you have a seconder councillor Reeves thank you speakers for the motion once again this is an important council document and is being released for the public 's review and comment I encourage all members of our community to us this what we 're proposing in our budget for the current becoming 2018-2019 budget and I commit as such I 'm hoping to see some good response from their community I recommend their recommendations to Council Thank You counselor Ellis Chancellor Scott hi mr. mayor and councillors this just wanted to acknowledge the work that 's been done the assiduous work that has been done by the staff developing these fears that has really been quite that we exist in this current environment around rate capping cost of recycling yet rolling out a capital works program as was noted at 38 point four million providing 100 services across the Shire and we know that our Shire is a very diverse and varied Shire and we know that the benefit of socializing that cost allows us to socialize the benefits so that we look after some of the most vulnerable and needy people in our Shire and we have we know the c-4 index of our Shire shows that we have a very high disproportionately higher proportion of people who are in need so we need to look after those people and some of those services are mentioned on page 19 of the draft budget and there there are a hundred services that we provide and it 's just fantastic that we can do that and I really commend the staff and the community for allowing this to happen it is so so important it allows access to these we do welcome feedback from the community on this matter we try to get it right and try delivered but the real process is for people to give that feedback and to let us know that we have got it right it is terribly important so councillors Thank You counselor Reeves and it speakers against the motion Council buckle yeah thank you mister me once upon a time we used to have just one capital improved value tax there you know in the before the amalgamation and it saves us an awful lot of bother and hassle and a much simpler way of doing it but my main objection is to the municipal charge which is a really a service tax and the ratio of unfairness if you like but like the highest capital value improvement value that we have is 30 million six hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars that 's the highest capital improved value and the lowest capital improved value is one thousand dollars so if you work it out by simple arithmetic that 's a ratio of thirty thousand six hundred and twenty seven to one and I think for a service tax that 's just way over that Thomas ridiculous so that 's Thank You counsel Bucky Buckley any speakers for the motion against cancel what thank you mr. Muir I just with regard to the right capping I I 'm looking out there at what 's looming and I can see quite a lot of hurt coming to a lot of the ratepayers you know financially I think from the rural sector it 's going to flow through too many of the businesses in the towns and I would like to see perhaps the show do better in some of their endeavors perhaps save some money rather than to ask for more money and that 's why I wouldn 't support the rate increase thank you Thank You councillor any speakers for the mesh any further speakers against sorry council pearl speaking for the motion yes for the motion I actually think that council is delivered a responsible budget the bottom line for me is if people want services they do have to pay for it every year these services go up and I know in the community we are a challenge community we have a lot of aged people a lot line to me is the state government has input a a rate cap on us of 2.75% and basically our staff has adhered to that and I think with regards to what 's coming what 's in front of us I think we 've done a very responsible budget the bottom line for me is people need to have a good read of this and come in and talk to us what 's your submission in that you 're actually not happy and why it 's a really great process that they can actually be tabled we can come and have the discussion at our table as to why you 're not happy with this and you know it opens our eyes to areas that need tweaking and they 'd need further detail so please have like counselor Ellis said my colleagues I actually believe that the community if they happy with this budget they 'll read it they 'll put a submission in and they 'll come to the table and come and address us a bit great thank you Thank You councillor pearls any speakers against councillor Alice I just remind without I acknowledge the objections to the release of this budget document but I wish to remind counselors this is just the release of the budget document i encourage counselors who may not be happy with our budget to research and and question the budget document that 's before us and bring debate back to the chamber on the date that we discussed to pass the budget so that we can be shown along with the submissions that i 'm sure i assure you will be considered that we take the right step forward so I commend the release of the budget draft budget for consideration by members of our community Thank You snick Thank You counsel Alice I 'll now put the motion all those in favor against it 's carried six four and three against Thank You mr. mayor can I just ask when this is due to come back to be heard back in council miss Collins thank you yes mr. mee the final budget will be presented with special council meeting on the 26th of June before that there 'll be this the that meeting thank you thank you miss Collins so it brings us to item before need a motion to discuss that contract Thank You counselors yes please counselor ease so this is a four point one in accordance with section 77 2 C of the Local Government Act 1989 on 29 March 2018 the report and attach prepared respect to this contract were designated by the CEO the chief executive officer as confidential as such they 're captured by the provisions of section 89 2d the Local Government Act and should be considered in closed session since been moved counselor either have a seconder counselor pills happy to second that any speakers against I 'll put the motion all those in favor against is carried unanimously it 's clear the gallery thank you _"

member and driving force behind mallacoota and district business and tourism association or mayor barter and so councillors and community members our thoughts and condolences are with John 's family and his friends and I hope that you will support that motion as I mentioned a letter of condolence thanks counselors thanks counselor ease now counselor Reeves has moved for a motion for a letter of condolence to have a second counselor pills any questions I 'll put that all those in favor against that 's character counselor Roberts another brief one from me late in late in December float the event was a great success with a really large turnout an American and an incredible amount of effort has gone into building the floating art gallery down it now now and it 's great credit to the team even though I was not on account not there on official council duties I was lucky enough to be doing aerial photography as their drone a drone or drone operator from the event so it 's really cool to get a really different perspective of the event mmm the 16th of January we did walk around Painesville referring to our deferred item tonight we had a look around the proposed maritime precinct site to get a first-hand look at the area and how it would affect existing industrial works and how it might or might not be beneficial Painesville and it was really really for me being a new counselor especially and I know it was well-received around the table but being able to get a first-hand look at what the facts that might haven 't_''_924.75 been actually out being able to actually have a look at the site and how it may be appropriate so I 'd like to attend more of those I know it 's challenging with my conditions but it was really beneficial from my point of view on that side for Australia day I got to head down to mallacoota this was really great I got the opportunity I got the choice to do they do brutha normal occur and I thought I really don 't get down to visit that into the shire enough and going down there was great because it set the sense of community in mallacoota is really astounding such a beautiful part of the world and brought back many memories from when I was a kid attending the mallacoota festival a great credit to the mal cooter and district Lions Club as well as Steve and the other volunteers organizing such a great event it 's just really it was like everyone it 's a big family it would also like to haven 't_''_977.779 got this written here so I 'll see how we go but I 'd like to mention Pauline Gary and I believe it may have been but she did something really quite astounding and I think it 's a really nice story she was on a she was with a paddling Club paddling up the Nikko in December and paddling up the river and she heard a noise in the bushes up ahead and other people that she was paddling with sort of put it down to a put it down to a bird or something don 't really worry about it it 's just something in the inish in the shrub my she she fixated on it and she couldn 't really get past it and as they were paddling there 's no this is not a bird this this is something else going on here and eventually she goes no I 'm gonna go I 'm following this up money to go and have a look so she paddles over she can hear she can hear a dog and she still can 't find where this where the noise is coming from anyway she she pedals in and she 's sitting at the side of her of a mud cliff and she finds a just just just the edge of the mouth just carrying on and she goes well I gotta get this dog out so she tries to dig it out thinking it 's a you know Jack Russell Uruk LP or something like that not too big 45 minutes later they get this huge dog out of the mud and the dog was you know really really poor state she had no idea how long had it been there and she hauls this thing underwear kayak continues down and then gets the gets the dog to the vet the dog can 't stand it 's barely alive and they eventually get the dog to the vet they find the dogs being bitten by snake has fallen from the cliff into the mud it 's been there for five days it 's completely paralyzed it 's 14 years old and it makes a full recovery and gets reunited to its family and that is just awesome now I know it 's not really relevant here but I thought no she needs a she needs it really so I would like to commend Hawley so not often you get to get nice pieces of information like that now I 'm maybe getting some of the some of the details slightly incorrect but if any of you know Pauline asked her about it it 's awesome she 's made friends with the family she 's got all these photos it 's just it 's unreal so thank you thanks counsel Roberts a great example of community spirit below councillor Buckley Thank You mr. mayor well I won 't be able to top that one we 're life and you mentioned our thing I 'm sure that I 'm over today our lines are getting bitten on the ground up there but we hope we can keep doing it so find a way we can get our membership back up again and our numbers were down a little bit too as well on the 19th of January an AGM of the benamber cooperatives thought that 's buta was held all the board of directors retired and did not seek reelection and were replaced by a younger and larger board no dividend was declared and it was the buildings and infrastructure I would like to add that the community is quite grateful for the help and advice received from Kate Nelson a decade or so ago that enabled us to form a co-op and avoid the closure of the shop and post office thank you mr. mee thanks Council Buckley counselor Ellis Thank You mr. mayor I 'll be very brief too as January was a fairly cotton I also like to highlight the passing of another distinguished Citizen of least Gippsland and that was the passing of mr. Peter turtle Stewart of likes entrance mr. Stewart was a very highly regarded Lakes Entrance citizen who 's dedicated his life to a number of community groups especially those associated with football and golf throughout the entire East Gippsland region would be hardly anyone associated with those two sports that would not known of turtle he was a man that gave all and left little behind when he moved on he was an exceptional citizen and he will be greatly missed counsel raised referred to the beach games which I also attended another successful event and I will also attended they Australia Day celebrations like all of us and I was it Lakes Entrance once again I think the Lions Club of Lakes Entrance for the dedication and amount of work that they put into that particular day I also like to I congratulate the award winners especially young citizen of the year for Lakes Entrance and mr. Nicholas Bain quite an achievement by young Nick I attended the citizenship ceremony and was pleased to welcome a number of citizens into our community I also attended the annual woodchop competition that likes entrance which is developing into a real calendar event touching on what councillor Roberts mentioned earlier in relation to the activities of the float art group based at Lake tires Beach the pleasure and opportunity to attend their activities at Lake Ty 's beach house road this weekend and also at Lake Ty 's speech I understand the mayor would say we just didn 't cross paths incredible amount of work has gone into that event and in fact some of the activities are continuing and I 'll report further on the work of float and mee thanks counselor Ellis Council what Thank You mr. Muir the same for me that we 've just only had a few events on since the last meeting but I also attended Australia Day ceremony at Linda no in the a machine Reserve of course another one hosted by the by the Lions Clubs just from being Linda knows lions it was a good day and well attended what was really good is that the the young school kids get involved they they 're given a task prior to the day or probably towards the end of last year 's last term to write poems that reflect on what their thoughts are on Australia Day and they you know only young kids but they come forward and read their poems out and that 's very good because it brings the young people in the community to these events and it was a little disappointing unfortunately Linda no did not have a recipient of award this year but it still went ahead we we still had a reasonably good crowd at that event and then later on in the day I the Citizenship Awards and I too would like to congratulate young Nick he 's somebody who I 've only come to know the last six months with he 's been the captain of the special school and it was his last year but he is a really fine young young fellow and I wish him the very best in his future because these these kids have have obstacles to overcome and he 's doing a great job at it and and and also well done to the to our new citizens who took the oath and then just yesterday we had a an impromptu livestock committee meeting regarding it 's a flow-on from the the new work that will be done on Joss Street and the bridge which will limit the capacity to use the facilities we have at the moment due to traffic flow and we we had a very good meeting yesterday amongst a diverse group of people in attendance was marks up wit from cross co who 's been given the task of probably drawing up the project after we discussed it and what was really good diverse group of people and we were looking at because this is needs to be done in a hurry because otherwise the facility to be unusable once the yeah the roads and roadworks is under way so thank you thanks council white council pills Thank You mr. mayor wow what an extraordinary holiday period he keeps laying his head the region 's been abuzz with visitors to the region and they 're all attending our great activities that our communities are holding for them I 've heard unofficially around the grapevine that Lakes Entrance was recognized by bookings calm as the fifth most popular destination over the busy holiday season and with over 35,000 visitors coming to the township and enjoying its facilities and what it has and the report seen have been nothing but favorable so I think that 's a really good accolade on behalf of the East Gippsland Shire and more visitors to come I presume which is great I had the pleasure to be amongst the can River community for the Australia Day celebrations with a very active group we probably only had about maybe 60 so they were young families traveling through the township itself was very busy and all of the eateries were being utilized heavily we had the bush nurses on standby and they were doing health checks and the SES they were cooking the eggs and bacon and sausages and both groups were hoping to stimulate more members with their displays that they had and I have to truly be frank with the main industry hallmark oats that the sawmill being closed the township is now getting smaller which is a real shame so I 'm afraid the interest in is diminishing in these towns as the main services are disappearing and the population is either getting aged or they 're moving away so this is what is the reflection of reality in a community such as the outer lying ones the real shame to see these areas come to their demise because they 've lost their major industry it 's absolutely appalling it means that we lose the volunteers and it means we lose the skills as well so you know once these people get aged and they move on or a tease at a town I 'm probably not on similar to you know some of the smaller outer lying areas and it may be I don 't know progression or whatever but that town on the point of two highways it 's an absolute shame I 'm hoping that it at some time in the future some economic stimulus will come and replace or be enlightened to help that community up there I did manage to start off the gumboot throwing contest which I believe everyone who attended and participated they all actually had a few giggles they all had to go and no one was shy it was really quite hilarious and when I threw mine I managed to throw it straight up in the air and had to duck out of the way because it was coming back down on my head I think I spilt my egg sandwich down the front of me and um you know that was all entertaining as well I didn 't participate in the sack race as I felt it was unethical for a counselor to be attending in the sack leave at that time and headed the two-hour drive back to Ben 's Dale to be with my family for the rest of the day and I have to say that the counselors have been very active over the summer period and I guess we 've been doing what we enjoy the most that 's getting out and about and talking to people and enjoying the holiday period with our families and friends all over the food places we 've had some really good reviews for our restaurants up here and people have been traveling specifically down from Melbourne to culminate at some of our more recognized restaurants that are popping up around the place so I 'm welcome and happy new year everyone and that concludes my report Thank You mr. mee thanks Council pals I 'd like to mention that East keeps an art gallery councillor Alice attended an opening for me last week but I just like to acknowledge the great work that Krystal Stubbs the director there and her staff have done in continuing with opening up the gallery to the community there 's been I a look at these events the other thing that I wanted to talk about was Curtis Australia their bespoke handcrafted jewelry which is sold around the world Curtis Australia is a family-owned luxury brand based in been start creating fine jewellery and bespoke handcrafted pieces which are sold to customers all around the world they 're dedicated and talented team of jewellers designers and watchmakers take great pride in handcraft and quality sought-after pieces when their business could be situated anywhere in the world but they choose to live in East Gippsland where they get their inspiration for many of these designs from our great region during December the Curtis business was visited by the epic Times newspaper which has a social media following of 90 million people this is a Chinese newspaper with an editorial team based in Box Hill went talking to the twelve delegates from the Boxee office I knew very little about a skip slant and though their breath was taken away by the great natural beauty of our region 's flora and fauna along with our magnificent high country and coastal towns and villages their region which has potential to further boost our visitor economy numbers I would like to thank the Curtis family for establishing and maintaining the presence of their unique business right here in East Gippsland we need to celebrate the successes of this businesses and these small business champions that think locally and act globally also tended the bans Dale Secondary College presentation night this was a great event run by the students with some assistance from councillor Roberts and highlights students citizenship academic excellence and leadership I 'd like to take the opportunity if I had support from my fellow councillors to have an initiative where each school in our municipality has a East Gippsland shire flag given to them to fly proudly whenever they have events like presentation nights and I think it 's important for the students to see that link with local government particularly during their schooling and in formative years we had to mention around these Australia Day awards for these Gippsland show the bansilal award was taken out by Helen gottschalk a very worthy winner who 's been a tireless worker in our community and person who 's got a great future ahead of her thank you item 5 officer reports item 5.1.1 is planning scheme amendment c128 request a very restrictive covenants Matheson 's road and forged creek roads eagle point and in attendance we have miss Vogel thank you [Music]_._2172.5 Thank You mr. while have any questions counselors counselor pals yes me miss Michael with regards to if this is approved in this forum tonight and if it 's if it 's adopted how long would the expectations be for us to to note the approval of the planning scheme amendment will be accepted by the Minister how long will that process actually take counselor you had a question Thank You mr. mayor the planning panels Victoria you 've gotta cost their daily cost have you any idea how many days is involved councillor Pearl 's is happy to move the motion yes I 'm happy to endorse this movement of this motion I think it 's really important that it goes through as quickly as possible it 's been seconded by councillor tui any speakers I 'd like to speak to it Reynolds on her hard work with regards to attending to this because and and of course there are other planning officers they 've done a lot of work working with the community and I think they 've been really helpful in getting us to this stage so far I also would like to commend the works of mr. Michael Sadler and although I know he 's worked on behalf of some of the property owners I think in the report they also highly endorsed a lot of his comments that he actually put in so I thought that was of interest to us that he is well thought of and his comments were you know actually used constructively to help us get it to this stage so with that setting arm councillors I would highly recommend that we um put this through and give it the recommendation and deserves did ii do want to add any comments casa there is no further debate I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carried thank you item 5.1 point it 's a snapshot of our planning activities and building building statistics quarterly report ending 30th of November 2017 Thank You mr. mayor this report provides a snapshot of 2017 calendar year you 'll note there are 506 planning applications received to 537 applications approved with an estimated value of over a hundred forty three million dollars over this period there was an average of plan permits issue sixty days being a 60% of applications received and you will note that the pending files in the last quarter of 2017 are down to 80 which is an excellent by all staff not just the the planning staff but all are associated professional staff whether they be our engineers our environmental health officers and many many more councils you also know that in the last quarter of last year there was over 39 million dollars worth of work approved by the planning permit applications after September October and November over called close to forty three million dollars worth of work approved by building permits issued with the news keeps the HR cancel I think this shows a lot of confidence from the developer stakeholders and the development industry and is well councillors to note this report Thank You mr. hollow any questions councillors the recommendation is for noting you have a mover for that recommendation moved councillor Roberts second councillor ease any speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against miscarriage thank you item 5.2.1 its the draft rating strategy for 2018 19 in attendance we have mrs. Collins executive manager finance Thank You mr. mayor the rating strategy is a document the council must adopt each year and this rating strategy has been reviewed for the 1819 year there 's been some updates but very minor updates given the impending changes to potentially impending changes throughout the government actor and in terms of the valuation process so the report the information is presented there the copy of the draft strategy 's attached and there 's a recommendation for councils consideration to adopt a strategy save me thank you thank you Miss Collins any questions counselors counselor Buckley yeah thank you means to me the maximum we can been requested to bring down the Unison charges I understand is 10% state government has recommended we bring it down charge can be set to up to 20% of the total rates a municipal charge and the review of the Local Government Act there is a proposal that that be decreased to 10% that 's correct counsel Buckley in the proposed changes can 't counsel appeals your question yes just with a further clarification of that at the moment we only charge 18% not the full 20% is that correct yeah yes counselor pills that currently sits at about between 17 and 18 percent and with the follow-on from that the local government and the new Local Government Act that 's recommending the 10% is not in place as yet and won 't be for a couple of years at this stage is that correct that 's correct okay so we could safely say within the next two to four years we will be working to get down to a ten percent differential right as requested with with with with the changes proposed with local government act as well is moving to annual revaluations there 'll be a community consultation process there 'll be a whole range of rating components what that might look like in terms of a proposed four-year rating in revenue strategy so there 'll be significant consultation and discussion with counselors to work through I 'm going forward in terms of the rating strategy Thank You mr. Collins question he forgot something else mr. Mann thank you very much for my indulgence and so at that stage too it 's in village that council will actually review differential rates on farm properties commercial properties and industrial properties alike yes the review of the rating strategy and at any point in time certainly council can review the use of differential rates the number the etc etc in terms of how we use them and set them but this just sets the base in terms of going forward when we 're puttin together the budget and it does provide some assistance that the rating strategy thank you miss Collins any other questions councillors we have a recommendation before us remover move councillor Reeves we have a seconder seconded councillor O 'Connell speakers yeah thanks mr. mayor councillors just acknowledge the work that 's been done by the officers basis is how we move forward until such time as there 's a mandated change I recommend that we do stay with our municipal charge as it is though I 'm sure that it will be counselor or councillors who speak against that but municipal charge in particular does have exemptions for farm enterprises so those counselors who are going to talk on behalf of the far-flung regions and the farmers they can get an exemption I understand it also is an incentive for people to develop those vacant blocks and people who have baking blocks and leave their boats on them and caravans on them use our roads access our tips have access to all the the benefits and privileges of the Shire and it 's fair that they contribute in this way so I certainly recommend I commend this strategy councillors [Music] with the second I 'd like to speak and he further speakers counsel Buckley yep oh you were requesting anyone against the motion yep Thank You mr. men in my view we 'll always have problems with a with rates until we can improve the system state and we could start with absorbing our discriminatory service tax disguised as a municipal judge there are general rate tax and I find it until we are started to move towards those improvements or I find it difficulty to support this budget Thank You mr. mee thanks counselor Buckley speaker for the wage counselor Ellis Thank You mr. mayor um I take note of counsel Buckley 's points and I want to reassure them that these these those concerns are being considered over the next 12 months the state government will introduce the new Local Government Act which it will impact upon the way we manage our rating straight our rating processes and will which will also incumbent upon us to review the municipal charges my reading shows that there 's a talk to really address the municipal charge and figures ranging from reducing by 50 percent down to 10 percent allowing the freedom for various councils to continue to 20 percent so the motion before council tonight mr. mayor and councillors is in fact an interim strategy to cover us over this transition period whilst the new Act the public and then we can enable me to come back so over the next 12 months or so we will be quite busy with that matter that said I recommend as councillor Reeves has the motion before you thank you thanks counselor Ellis any further speakers against further speakers quell throats I 'll say something brief bit of a chat with with councillor Buckley and I think there is merit in some of the things he 's saying in regards to reworking the figures if you were to reduce or remove a municipal charge so their charges would be spread accordingly and I would like to see some more looking into that space thank you thanks counsel Roberts Council reads so thank you counselors I believe I have a right of reply yep counselors an interesting discussion a existential discussion if you like about tax about rates I 'm a big fan of tax a big fan of rates you need to flip the discussion around this is not an impulse this is a benefit we 're actually socializing the benefit by collecting these funds and sharing it across direct beneficiaries of the fact as we all are of the collection of rates in our Shire think of the 100 services or more but our Shire provides three aerodrums boat ramps every street light that illuminates your step as you clawed your way through our towns is provided by our Shire every footpath that you work on walk on every road that is not a big roads Road we pave where you maintain these are all hours every hack service every free Wi-Fi that you connect to Intel into our libraries every book you borrow every time you launch your boat at mallacoota like tires wherever it happens to be they are the Shire rates at work this is not an impost flip the conversation around councillors this is a shire benefit that we 're all providing and contributing to I recommend this ocean again thanks Council Reeves that now concludes the debate I 'll put the motion all those in favor against emotions carried so item 5.2 point 2 is finance and capital works report 6-month period ending to the food 31st December 2017 and in attendance many capital works report for the six-month period ending 31st of December 2017 is presented for councils information some of the key things to note through the report is the revised forecast opera operating result for the 1718 year which is estimated to be less than a doctor budget by 695,000 there 's a range of reasons for that in terms of we 've had additional grant funds come in but we 've also offset that with additional expenditure relating to those grants we 've had some works that were carried forward operating works where we received the grant last year but the works are being completed this year and that was over a million dollars that was brought in to this year 's expenditure so with those adjustments certainly we 're tracking to putting those aside tracking well in terms of operating and the result there 's certainly been some number of the variances in terms of the capital grants and the timing of the capital grants for certain projects does the impact on the operating result because of the year that we receive those grants versus potentially when we position a year end is looking much stronger but that 's really a result of a review of the capital works program at the end of December and in terms of some of the multi-year projects that have now had contracts awarded for them the the budget for some of those will carry across into the next year so there 's a significant amount of additional dollars in the bank at year end but it 's committed to those projects in terms of notes and explanations to variances they 're provided in the appendix to the report and given that this is a joint report the finance and the capital works component I 'll pass across to mr. weights to speak to the capital works component Thank You counselors with respect to capital works in summary the adopted 2017-18 capital budget was thirty five point six million dollars in addition there was another five and a half million dollars of land rebuilt our landfill rehabilitation projects a total of approximately 41 million mid-year expenditure was sitting at a fairly modest nine million dollars however there 's another almost ninety million ready to get underway with those works you will note and tonight 's commercial in confidence section there 's a another almost 10% of capital works that you will consider to award tonight so if that does go ahead we 'll have commitments and actuals of over 70% of the capital program at this point in the year which is a fairly big ramp up in the last couple of months and you 'll also see in tonight 's report that there 's some new projects listed all project budget adjustments have been shown and any projects that are delayed there 's an explanation of why those projects are delayed and how those projects are expected to be either brought back on track or when they 're deferred delivery date will be thank you councils Thank You mr. White 's councillors we 've had the reports through any questions council fells sorry I 'm just I 'm reviewing some of the grants there and there was um some that I was a bit concerned about and it was the vulnerable persons project I was just wanting to know more information funding at the moment as I understand it so following the bushfires Royal Commission in 2009 there was a lot of work done to understand how we do actually know and track people who qualify as being vulnerable in the community and council has a part-time funder position that works with us and the various service providers that look after people there that receive assistance so at the moment he 's on going any further questions councillors it 's a recommendation before you don 't have a mover promotion move council what have a seconder councillor polls just like to speak council like I think you missed me I just do I 'm just to congratulate leaves on her thoroughness and how she gets stuck into her work and produces these outcomes for us and you know I I just like to say thank you Liz because I we all appreciate and can see what a really good job you are doing so thank you Thank You counsel white yeah I just like to say you know it 's a mucky time of you because you 're only six months still juggling funds on what 's going to get to the end of the the financial year and what 's not so the staff are doing a good job staying things I know that they 've got a lot of processes in place that are checking our contractors and keeping an eye on how they 're progressing with funds being spent there which i think is a really great initiative the staff that are doing that and also doing a great job in keeping everything up to double for us so I think that 's a really good welcome and we won 't find ourselves you know being too under budgeted for the financial year I think it 's um will be almost on par so I think you 're losing your team you 're doing a good job Thank You councillor pearls any further speakers I 'll put the motion all those in favor against its carry thank you so item five point two point three is a community joint use agreement 2018 the benzylic otic and Recreation Center and Forge theater and we have mr. Halton in attendance would be aware the pencil aquatic and Recreation Center in the forge theater are established on Education Department land and in order part of the arrangements that I 'm in that require that a joint use agreement the interface or the that that outlines the roles and responsibilities of all parties in respect to the occupation of that land with the redevelopment of the pencil Aquatic and recreation center with the addition of new pool and an extension to the the area that the city now occupies a new agreement was required to be put into place by the Education Department 's schools Building Authority that agreement has been developed in consultation with between Council the school and the school building Authority and is now ready to be executed and the recommendation is that council has resolved we enter into a new agreement and to note that the the content of the agreement as well as authorized the CEO to execute that agreement on behalf of council happy to take any questions Thank You mr. Holden any questions counselors we have a recommendation before us ever move thanks counsel Roberts hopefully will will pave the way for a benefit to the shire and the Banzhaf Secondary College as a whole moving forward with the next stage the band 's Dale Secondary College development as well as the the Aquatic Centre and the sporting facilities review through across the Shire so I 'm really looking forward to seeing what all this big piece of the puzzle links up to thank you thanks Council Roberts councillor did you is there any further speakers if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor against motions carried thank you item 6 mr. CEO in the urgent business there 's no vision another business mr. mayor item 7 of our agenda is a confidential business just need a motion in camera pursuant to action section 89 2d and the Local Government Act 1989 to consider item 7.1 as this item relates to contractual matters mr. mayor move second counselor Ellis all those in favor against carried thank you we 'll have a two-minute break just before we deal with item sunport line thank you _"

thank you 're very excited to have you on board and having a chat with us thanks so much ava and thank you so much councillor taylor i really appreciate that introduction and also a huge thank you to all of you and who are on the line today i 'm really excited um obviously i did a lot in sport in general but um what i 'm more excited about is living back down here in frankston because it 's a pretty great place to be awesome um so just by kicking it off today i just thought i 'd ask you obviously being international women 's day uh what does international women 's day mean to you for me in particular it 's just a reminder um i guess just to keep pushing the boundaries and just to not accept things as how they are um i know that we 'll delve into the sports side a lot very soon um however you know when i was growing up and i kind of looked at what i wanted to be and i didn 't really know and i didn 't i never forget when i first got picked up in my melbourne my first melbourne team i was 15 years old so i was very fortunate because i was very tall and lanky when i was younger but my mum got a phone call and she goes shani jane cell 's on the phone and i went who 's that she 's like i don 't know apparently she 's the coach of the melbourne kestrels and i went who were they um you know because i played sport for fun and i loved netball but i never knew that there was a melbourne team called the melbourne kestrels and they then wanted me to go and train with them and i was like oh my god this is amazing like i wanted to be an olympian because that 's all i saw um except there wasn 't a very good runner i couldn 't really do high jump or long jump or anything like that so um for me to go oh my god there 's another opportunity to represent my country and then i did some research and was a big rivalry between australia and new zealand it just made me go okay wow like i wish i had known more of that i played cricket but i had to stop playing when i was 12 because we weren 't allowed to play anymore and i always would have loved to have played football but never had the opportunity to do that either well early on obviously i did it later on um so back to your question international women 's day it 's about being seen and it 's about whatever you 're doing in your own industry whatever that might be for you so for me that is sport and it 's showing people that they can be who they are that they don 't have to be any particular way i 'm quite outspoken and loud um you know i 'm not always you know like people don 't always love me because i am quite loud but also that 's okay and it 's about being able to be yourself and be in a workplace or a team environment and respect each other but and being brave enough to break the bias by speaking up and if you see something that 's not right or you go hang on a minute we do the exact same role but there 's a bit of pay difference there or um you know especially in sport you know we 're doing so much here or so much there and why is that and being brave enough to ask the question and not thinking that you 're um annoying anyone or you 're stepping out of your lane but just kind of going actually just from a place of inquisition here like what is that like and why are we doing this and can we have a discussion around that um and the way that i then do that um is by being really brave but only because it 's not about me and my own position but it 's about what i 'm doing for the future generation so if i have this conversation is that then better for someone else and so international women 's day is a reminder to go don 't just accept where help future generations yeah definitely paving the way for the people next to come for sure um so you 've all you 've touched on it a little bit and we 've we 've also explained it a little bit but can you tell us a bit about your journey in sport so growing up from juniors you you 've obviously played netball and afl but people might not know you 've done a bit bit more as well so a little bit about your journey in sport growing up so my journey in sport growing up i grew up um in palm beach so not too far down the road and i did everything i did horse riding um yeah equestria netball cricket up until i was 12. life saving i was just a really athletic kid i just love to move around and do all of those things and i think that all contributed to my athleticism and also learning really good teamwork in so many different varieties of sports um and then from there because i was always so tall and lanky i was always tripping over i 'd never even made the a team for i played down here at waves just down the road because you can see here um so i played at peninsula waves and i was always in the b team like never got selected in the a team and that was fine because i just played for fun but it made me really appreciate sport so um that was okay i learned so much through that and then it wasn 't until under 15 's in netball that i then got selected to trial for an academy and through that academy i got to trials for the state team so that was the pathway in nipple and still is for those of you that are interested um and so through that was when i played for my first victorian team in under 15s and the coach of that team was the assistant coach for the melbourne team and so then that 's how that whole melbourne team um came about but the thing that i really loved about that was then once i made the melbourne team the melbourne coach uh shiny playing in the top league championship out at parkville because i used to play at waverly in the under 15 bees and they went okay so i went from the under 15 b team i skipped seven teams to play the championship team um so that i could get you know advanced so i could advance quick guard get better skills by training with older girls and i improved out of sight and for me it was a real lesson around don 't just accept where you are because that 's what a person said that 's where you belong i was kind of like wow i really managed to show them that i could be better and i did that by skipping seven teams with some help of people who actually believed in me so really surrounding yourself with people that believe in you um from there i was like oh i 've made it but i had not i sat on the bench for a melbourne team um for six years i was with the melbourne kestrels and then the melbourne vixens after that and unfortunately i on the court i talked to myself out of being good and then i got smashed by my opponent because of my mindset that gave me really bad anxiety and i had to do a lot of work with sports psychologists to be able to get myself out of that position um in 2008 so i got picked up in 2003 in 2008 i was with the melbourne vixens and i think i was one out of six players out of the entire league not to step on the court that year um and that was my sixth year on the bench and i just thought look maybe this isn 't for me um i 've given it everything i can and i got a call from the adelaide thunderbirds who asked if i wanted to give it a go there and i thought you know what new environment new coach i 'm going to move to adelaide and see if i can just give it one last shot before i give up and that year i got rookie of the year we won the premiership and i got picked got rookie of the year because i don 't know if they knew that i 'd been training for six years already um but i didn 't tell them that i just took i took the check uh fairly decent um decent achievements for that one year yes exactly but it was nice to get rewarded for all the hard work that i 'd put in and you know you just hit that roadblock over and over again and i think we 've all felt that over the last two years in covert um especially down here in melbourne and not being able to do what we have been able to do but you know i feel like over the next year or two you will see the rewards of the personal development and growth that we 've all had by being locked up um it 's good yeah obviously it wasn 't fantastic so that was really the kickoff of my of my netball journey so that was 2010 and i ended up playing until 2018 and represented australia for seven years i went to two world cups in um every time that i was in that position standing on the transverse line singing the national anthem um and it was just yeah a phenomenal experience and one that i will hold on to forever and yeah really the rewards of of hard work and not giving up and i 'm glad that i had a great support network around me for sure yeah definitely um and obviously knowing that you went you went in your later career and played afl so you switched codes so what were the main differences obviously nepal predominantly women um women and girls um and then you when you switched over to football it 's generally male-dominated sports what was the main differences you 'd seen um gone across those two codes well i guess for me there actually wasn 't too many differences because in 2017 i moved back to melbourne and i played with the collingwood football club in netball so they created their own netball team which is still around today and from there i was actually i was really proud because they didn 't know what to expect from the footballers were there all day every day from morning to night getting fed they have their own chef they get their breakfast and their lunch made up for them dinner if it 's a late night um you know you walk past the physio rooms and they 're all just getting their little calves rubbed and you know we 're there with our bags running in and out going to work coming back um but when we were out on that netball court um so obviously that was number one one of the main differences is the different treatment um from footballers afl who there 's over 400 of them in the league uh there were five of us in that team that were in the australian team for netballs who were in the top 12 of over a million women that played the sport and going how do i get the car for up or how do i get my lunchbox where 's my personal chef you know like but i think you know the one thing that i learned about that journey was that you know complaining it 's important to highlight them and it 's important to highlight that that 's not complaining because i think quite often if you highlight what the differences are even if in afl at the moment you get labeled with a whinging culture um i 'm not whinging i 'm actually just telling you what 's going on right now and you can perceive that as you wish um if you did something about it that would also be great but point being i was in at the club and the boys watched us train and they just went wow like you women are amazing it 's intense and the first month we were at the club none of them would talk to us and i was like wow they 're really uneducated around being able to have conversations with women or whatever it might be and then that was in the december the first month we were ever there and then over christmas i could grab a few guys on one because i would enchant training at the gym and obviously i could talk a bit and i said okay that we 're here i know it would be so new for you all having to share your facilities like thank you so much and one of the older guys went oh my god sharni we are so scared of you like we are so scared of you we 're so scared of your whole team you 're so professional and strong we 've never seen women as strong as you um and they they didn 't know how to have those conversations because they were so intimidated so it just showed that they weren 't used to being around that powerful um driven self-spoken um kind of person and so you know which you 're like wow but then you 're also like wow that 's really disappointing as well that you haven 't experienced that so you know you can take that as you wish but you know that that evidence is there from both sides about them learning how to deal with that but also that there 's not enough out there to be brave to step up into those roles um or there 's not better you 've obviously got the bulldogs melbourne and richmond who all have female presidents which is amazing so it 's getting there um and then stepping over to aflw which is really part time like less obviously netball they get paid a minimum wage of 40 grand a year which isn 't too bad um but in footy you know you 're looking at 15 to 20 000 so there 's paramedics there 's nurses um this year in particular you know girls are having to fly and fly out of games they get home at two o 'clock in the morning and they 're up at 6am going to work the next day and yeah um it 's like really it 's kind of unsafe for them um to have to do that and to be put under the pressures to do that so it 's not about being full-time because i think that 's going to take time clubs need resources um they need coaches they need the medical staff they need the administration staff to be able to support them and it needs to be built program um because at the moment they 're wanting to push it which is great but they don 't have the support underneath them so it 's about growing it all together and also just putting their health and well-being first it 's going to take time but the stresses the players are under this year there is a real iniquity about that yeah definitely um and you you 've already mentioned it briefly in terms of coming a long way in in terms of woman 's footy um but what else do you think that football as well as any other sporting code um can do to help kind of level that playing field and break the bias for women and girls in sport well i think it 's just about that support from afar you know the athletes are doing everything that they currently can um to be the best athletes that they can be and so where the money comes in is broadcasting so for those of you that want to help um it 's about turning your tv on i often say to people i don day like turn your tv on to whatever channel that women 's sport is going to be on during that day so that the numbers can be up so that the corporates can jump on board if there 's those of you that have i know that you do you have really good connections whether it 's in the corporate world or with sponsors or with government grants or whatever that might be um being able to support women 's sport because they 're such great role models and you know they don 't get themselves in trouble they are really well grounded um and you know a lot of sponsors are coming into sporting clubs and saying we are sponsoring you because there are women involved in this program but the women aren 't necessarily seeing the money that is coming in their way so um you know clubs is there or you know is there as many people in your sporting club committed to growing women 's sport you know i was down at um and this is a positive story but i was down at the telecom because there weren 't women that could be seen within that and that 's a local sporting club you know that 's not that 's not even up at um the top level but i was at an event at the mcc this morning and there was a huge picture um of the australian women 's cricket team which was amazing but amongst the hundreds of paintings of men and i just walked through there with a little giggle and just said happy international women 's day um but it also just shows where we 're coming from yeah and you know and there will be there will be so many women up on those walls in the future but it also shows um you know that unconscious bias of what we 're dealing with when we 're going for these roles and women knowing that you don 't have to be sporty to be involved with sport and to make a difference because your difference of view is what will make the difference in sport in that organizational level which is what will make the difference for the athletes roles to be involved in those clubs and yeah lovely um so you mentioned earlier in terms of cricket when you were younger you had to kind of stop at a certain age because there was no more teams and as well as the kind of pay disparities throughout your whole career have you um was there any other sort of kind of bias that you experienced just by playing um sport as a as a woman um and uh you know what what was those experiences growing up i think probably um i 'll talk about probably more of a personal note on on this one but even playing cricket were you know my very first game i was playing impact with my cousin and i was opening ball up with scottie bull and i 'll have you all know so that 's pretty much what you 're doing yeah yeah um but my very first game you know just the hair cleaning oh you 've got a girl in your tomb and luckily like i 'm a very obviously confident person and i 'm very grateful to my 's why i am how i am because i want to show other girls and women they can be that too even if they don 't have those role models um so you know it 's kind of like water off a duck 's back with me because i knew that i was athletically gifted um in the you know a confident way also it 's okay to say when you 're good at something as a female or as any human men you 're allowed to say good at something too but um you know cross out tall poppy syndrome in australia so i just kind of just it was water for ducks back but i remember you know my the way that i responded to that was you know i remember bowling out the guy in the very first bowl of the game and i just kind of i won 't stick my fingers up here um but you know that was a way of doing that with an action to say well actually i 'm just as good as you especially because i 'm a you know yet so you have no advantage over me at this current point in time um so that for me but then you know then growing up i was always labeled as a tomboy you know and i think and i carried that label with me throughout my life i felt that i couldn 't be feminine because i played sport and then i couldn 't correlate the both two together i didn 't realize you could have masculine and feminine energy and that really affected my confidence growing up um you know just not really knowing who i was or where i fitted in and i think we 're doing such a better job in regards to people and allowing them to be themselves but we still have such a long way to go with that but then i actually you know it was almost the opposite i was in this female dominated sport and i wasn 't a girly girl so i didn 't fit in in being a girly girl so we also have a long way to go as women as accepting each other in different ways um i have to do so much for free in comparison to men because if you want to get on radio or if you want to be on the news or um you know if you want coverage like i don 't know if it 's common knowledge but netball have to pay the paper to get articles written this year um so you know maybe journals could just do their job and write about it i don 't know does that sound that hard um yeah so it 's just you know those kind of things where we 're still missing the beat a little bit and just that as i said you know i played for australia i 'm proud of it i was in the top 12 of over a million people but i have to do things for free to get our sport heard and i will continue to do that because we have to um but my question is for how long yeah yeah for sure um in terms of sporting clubs now so turn into the actual clubs why do you believe it 's the bias what benefits do you think the clubs will get out of it as well as i said it 's just about being an inclusive environment um you know whether it 's your gender your sexual orientation and being a place that you 're comfortable and supported to be around and i love frankston everyone i really do but um it is a very you know male sport we love our footy and let 's go to the pub and grab a beer and i love that i really do um but it can be very intimidating it 's not intimidating for me because that 's my personality um but if you don 't have a strong personality and you know what not all men have that personality so about being able to have be a man with feminine energy to feel comfortable about going into a sporting club and playing footy or qriket if they want to without being bullied i know we 're on international women 's day so we 'll flip back to women now but um you know so it 's about being seen it um females make fantastic afl coaches and you know getting that development and you could be the sporting club that brings through that female coach that creates their next afl afl and or afl women 's coach like you could be the sport that creates that environment to be able to do that and i think that that is really powerful and it 's about um you know including and not judging because of as we said gender about how much people know about a certain sport and i think that having the as i said down at de la mother um telecom obviously cricket club having that women 's wall is a really great step around showing actions we are inclusive we 're going to create a women 's cricket team they 've got i think they 're building on doing that but they 're showing that they want to and then you will automatically draw the energy of those people to your sporting creating that visibility yeah exactly right lovely um and in terms of so one thing there 's a bit of a starting point for clubs you know future for women and girls in sports and non-binary people what 's that one kind of starting point then that they should kind of consider um consider doing i think up as a club like and just kind of go where are we at um and i don 't you know like there 's all like quotas and all kinds of things these days but i did a talk with um the so kylie who is the president of the western bulldogs football club this morning and you know she said that you know all of her boards and everything that she 's on with disney they 're all 50 50 but not because they have to be because by hiring different opinions and hiring in the right way or getting those that diversity into your club you 're automatically going to find that balance because that in itself is having the difference of opinions being open to listening to that difference of opinion and i guess for those people that have been involved in the sporting clubs for such a long amount of time you know you years or longer um and we 're not having a go we 're not having a go at you and saying everything you 've done is wrong all we 're saying is that things are changing and can you please be open to that so i 'm not saying that you would take it personally but you might so just dropping the veil around you know being able to be vulnerable go where are we at right now how do we want our club to be diverse where can it be more diverse and every club 's going to be different in that being able to address that and if you 're struggling with that then get someone external in to be able to help you with that process in how you can create a safer and more diverse place yeah awesome and i guess that 's what we 're going to be discussing a little bit later on and how we can support in doing that um and we 'll be showcasing that toolkit so um just a few more questions before we open it up to everyone else for shiny that 'd be awesome um in terms of any advice so you 've obviously played numerous sports at various levels as well as having some other roles within the sporting community um do you have any advice for young women and girls or non-binary people that want to get involved in sport but might be a bit you know a bit hesitant i would say grab a friend i think you know like i even have um you know i 'm the head of netball at methodist ladies college up in queue and that 's an old girls school and i get girls on students emailing me saying oh i 'm unsure if i should come or not i don 't you know i don 't know if i feel comfortable and i just say just grab a friend like who 's in your class and i 'll find someone you know so you can partner up so that you don 't have to be brave by yourself but you know you can just ask someone to go down there with you and then if they don 't then you 're through the door so what 's going to help make you feel more comfortable to take that step um i guess i 'm finding that club that suits you because every club is going to have a different vibe and that 's totally okay um so you know just knowing how much sport brings to your life like it 's community and building different networks and friendships is going to help you grow as a person it 's going to help you have different conversational skills it 's going to add so much to your life whether it 's in school or work outside of sport um and just create a really great well-being and balance i know for myself i hate going to the gym like i was an athlete but i hate going to the gym i hate going for runs so you know i 'm going to go down to frankston dolphins and have a run around on the field and kick a footy with them even if i 'm not playing on the weekend so that i can stay for it all right a laugh with the girls yeah um you know or if that 's a bit boisterous you don 't want to get tackled go down to your netball courts or go play a game of cricket or soccer or whatever it is there 's so many opportunities these days so and you can probably help me in regards to where they can find those clubs in those sports and look into that but if you don 't feel um comfortable doing it to start off with i just say grab a friend and go down with them um two or three of you if they then need a friend and there 's five of you that go down for the first session and there 's quite often come in try days which are really important for that um but just know that it 's okay to be uncomfortable you 're gonna feel uncomfortable and that 's okay i think a lot of people struggle with that feeling of what happens if i do this but the more you do it um the better you are at putting yourself out there that i 'm proud to say that i do a lot unfortunately at times like i 'm always like oh i don 't know if i should do this then i 'm generally going to do it because i want to know what 's on the other side and i will find out if it 's good or bad i 'll learn from those experiences and i put myself through that so that i can have these conversations a bit of a learning curve as well yeah absolutely um so last one before we open it up and i 've seen a few questions coming through which is great so just a positive ending to it so what was your favorite career highlight um do you know what i 'm so lucky i was up in rockhampton doing some netball clinics over the weekend and i said to the girls i 'm so lucky i 've got so many like you know and i 'm so fortunate to be able to say that i think um like your first there 's nothing like your first so my very first premiership years nearly quitting not thinking it was for me not thinking i was good enough and to get all those accolades in one year and to achieve that as a team was off the charts and it wasn 't even just about me and the team it was about having us on the front page of the paper when we were never on the front page of the paper it was about being on the news it was about sponsors wanting to come and talk to us and that was the same for the 2015 world cup in sydney when we had swiss and samsung and all these huge major brands that started investing in female sport and for me that was the first time that i 'd seen that in netball so i think those two for me was so powerful but um and then my first goal in aflw on a selfie note i was just like i kicked a goal two years ago i couldn 't even kick straight and now i 've kicked an aflw goal and i can carry with that with me forever and have our higher goals and achievements of what we want to do um you can also give yourself a pat on the back for those individual achievements that you 're really proud of as well for sure definitely um alrighty so we 'll just go through to the chat there 's a few that 's come through so um just given time i might pick out two or three so um jason 's got around your proudest achievement which is kind of covered there so helen um hi shiny if you could go back to being 10 to 12 years old again and gender equality did exist within all sports what sport would you have chosen yes such a good question i get this one a bit i still would have done netball because i loved representing my country i think um it 's so tough to get to the top 12 like still in aflw it 's an amazing achievement but once again there 's still over 350 footballers out there so to get to the top 12 of your sport represent your country go to a commonwealth games all over again yeah for sure awesome um one from jesse 's so what is next tell us about your current sporting pursuits and what goals do you want to achieve so good so i 'm allowing myself to take some space at the moment which is tough like it 's really hard um to not set goals but i 've set goals my whole life and i 'm a perfectionist and so i 'm trying to be okay with staying at home challenge my perfectionistic traits um but i 'm working at methodist ladies college in q i 'm the head of netball there from prep to year 12 and i will do that part time so i can do things like this still which is great and i 've got a dog three cats and two horses that i love and they keep me sane i think my husband 's in there somewhere too but um yeah i 'm just trying to be human again and this it sounds really bizarre but when you 've spent your whole life missing birthdays weddings dinners really special occasions or just highlight for me these days not just because i 've covered but because i sacrificed so much throughout my sporting career and i 've learned that community is so important that 's why i 'm loving doing this with my local council it 's been the best thank you team um but also yeah are you really it teaches you to really appreciate the little things in life definitely um we 'll go to one last one before moving on so one from debbie around how was the culture generally for women in nepal compared to it was just different culture like netball so cutthroat it 's honestly because you 've got seven on the court and you know three to five on the bench it 's like if you 're not good you 're out so it teaches you to be like you have to be a perfectionist because if you stuff up for that one second on call like you are off so it teaches you really good high performance behaviors it teaches you to be really mature about decisions around um healthy competition so for example i my best mates um to this day but i was always trying to kick her off the court because i wanted to play over the top of her so if she you know made a mistake i was like get off i 'm on um or vice versa but we could challenge each other in a healthy way it didn 't affect our personal relationship so it taught me you know not to take things um personally which was really cool so um i 've actually forgotten what the question was with all of that but anyway just yeah all good i think it was answered within all that anyway yeah um thank you so much we 've got one more question in the chat i was wondering maybe perhaps if you could just answer that one in there whilst just giving them we 'll move on yep um but thank you so much for that um yeah it was awesome to chat to you and hear about your experiences um around your sporting career so what i 'll do is i 'll hand it back over to simone i charlie it 's really fantastic to have um to have a champion that 's home grown and i think and returned home which is really really great for us at franklin city council who are trying to champion this stuff too to have it and and just a note to the council people in the room uh shawnee says shani 's the keen to be involved in other things that we do so we told her that was that we 're definitely taking her up on that offer yeah so and and like you said shani not only do we want to see people more girls and women being active and playing sport we want to see them in those leadership roles we want to see them in in positions of leadership as coaches coaches mentors umpires board members presidents um and we 've had a specific action um in our council plan here about co-designing and delivering a culture change program to help make that happen um which started last year in uh in june when we had um some uh workshops that were exploring to better explore and women in sport um after those workshops we actually also um worked with a few local clubs to create a short video that showcase clubs are already doing well in this space um and and can and could talk to and show the benefits of clubs that have what they 've seen as benefits since becoming more inclusive i 'm hoping to inspire a a further further amount of clubs to do that that as well um more recently during the weekend and friday the third to sunday the fifth of december council encouraged sporting clubs to participate in dedicated uh 16 days of activism um this is an annual united nations campaign to challenge violence against women and girls clubs are encouraged to wear orange in support of the campaign where players will orange arm tape and uh and they promoted through a range of initiatives um the campaign across a club activities and sport uh competition along across the weekend so and that brings us to the next part of meeting that action which is what we 're here tonight also to launch and demonstrate our new gender eva 's now going to run through that with us as well thanks simone um i 'm just going to stop showing my screen briefly just so i can pull up the other screen um as simone said we yeah so we 've we 've done a bit of work in the lead up to this okay we 're really excited to be able to share share this with you all um and hopefully i guess the next steps would be to encourage clubs clubs in our area to take this on board and and go back to their committees and work through it with with their um committees to become more gender inclusive um so i 'm hopefully sharing this screen at the moment um basically what what we what we did is we created a tool for clubs to be able to utilize with with the committee members um and just to run through it there 's four sections in the tool um going from the obviously the brief introduction of what it is we 've done in the background um some kind of stats of what we into the self-assessment tool itself so each of those sections um have got like different colors to kind of highlight make it easier for clubs to to see and distinguish so there 's a self-assessment tool uh then we move into the supportive resources and then we 've also got an action plan template so i 'll work my way through it i won 't go into the full detail of the of the actual self-assessment section itself but i 'll just briefly touch on all the areas so again as mentioned we 've got um acknowledgments in terms of there 's lots of work happening in this space already um we we 've we were looking at not necessarily reinventing the world but utilizing what is already out there um and and looking to kind of taylor as simone said taylor what taylor what 's out there get experiences from others learning so from big health they 've got um a useful tool and other counselling and um health services kind of got existing tools already so we 've we 've built upon their learnings to create this tool um in terms of the the introduction kind of section uh we 've got a bit of background about what we 've done like i said and where to begin um included with a case study as well so with our workshop that we hosted last year one of the main um areas that that our clubs had reached out and told us that they would like um to kind of see more of all council doing more of is supporting with case studies so um showcasing what others have already done give them some inspiration and how they can do how they can um achieve gender inclusive clubs themselves then we 've got the toolkit itself the resources and the templates so just briefly in terms of why inclusion is important obviously we 've touched on this within our chat too shiny but again um you know most people agree that we shouldn 't let our gender get in the way of what we want to achieve in life um but you know often sometimes women and girls might be a bit hesitant about um joining or signing up or policies um that might make them a bit hesitant to join so i guess in terms of the benefits obviously you know clubs could experience increased memberships and spectators um based on becoming more open and um inclusive um what shiny had also mentioned in terms of you 're getting you 're getting different um uh people on board in terms of in in specific roles so you 're opening up you 're becoming more diverse dynamic getting different opinions coming through as well um and and also like like it was also mentioned in terms of the sponsorship opportunities so when you open it up um and becoming more inclusive you 're you 're giving yourself an opportunity to attract new sponsors and volunteers that way as well um just briefly i thought i 'd touch on that it also links to a strategic plan so i 've got linked the active leisure strategy and the health and well-being plan and council plans for anyone that wanted to look into a bit of a local context again i won 't go into that but um when i send that and then we 've got links to the workshop and and the promotional video which we had um previously worked on so if we get time i 'll show this video at the end because it 's a bit of a pump up i quite enjoyed working on it and it gets you really excited to work in this space so in terms of where to begin i 'll just zoom up a little bit i guess the first most important step that we recommend is just making sure you have the support of the entire committee um this one 's important as with being volunteer based we know that there can be a turnaround in staff volunteers committee members from year upon year so ensuring that everyone 's on board would make sure that progress kind of continues year upon year as well as it just making it easier for everyone within the club to um if you know if you 've got everyone working on something it 's easier to manage as well so it 's not all loaded onto one individual um there 's the case so in terms of the tool itself again um the tools kind of uh recommended to be completed with the committee at a committee meeting um and it it goes through a range of different areas within the sporting club settings so over here you 'll see we 've got six areas um within the within the actual tool itself and there 's a range of different um i guess statements underneath each of those areas that the clubs would then have a look to see where they 're ranking up against those statements so in terms of those areas it 's basic club information leadership club culture membership and engagement volunteers and employment and facilities so basically what is suggested that clubs do again is they go through it with their committees and there 's a bit of a scaling system so they would then rank what their club is achieving based on that required statement underneath each of those areas so i 'll just show you one what it looks like so club information again this is a pdf version that you can edit straight into i 'm uh section there so this section here is just your basic club information so how many women and girls do you have how many men and boys any gender diverse and this prefer not to say column is is more so around if people prefer not to state their gender when they 're filling out their um registrations that 's that for that column there but again like simone said we want to look at across all all different roles within a sporting club so we want to know that yes we might be attracting more women and girls players but do we have um equal representation on you know committees coaching roles team management roles as well and other volunteer roles here 's the actual uh um one of the sections leaderships with the criteria here so again each of those six sections i mentioned before have got their own little um self-assessment kind of tool uh here so you look you would read the statement and then kind of based based on what your club club achieves is where you would tick um again so you 'd obviously score for that area so if um you know we go all the way through down threes over here we 'd provide our score in this section here um whatever whatever that might be um and then continue all the way through the club culture membership and engagement volunteers and employment and then facilities so there 's a whole range of different statements that were considered again what we had based these statements off were existing areas that you know vic health might have identified other other council areas might have identified but as well as what we kind of heard from our um workshops last year in june from from our actual sporting club um uh sporting club committee members staff and players as well so we heard from you guys what what it is that 's needed to kind of create a more gender inclusive club and make sure we incorporated them within these six six areas from here um once you 've gotten your total score it 'd be recommended to then add them all up here and give yourself your your total this is a bit suggest is that clubs would do this on an annual basis um to kind of track change over time so again you might be at the start of the journey um but i guess that 's that 's the first part so doing this tool would be the first part just to see what your baseline is the hope would be oh you know year upon year you gradually improve over time and you 'd work your way up to um you know a five-star gender inclusive club that 's that section of it the next section of it is the supportive resources um again with this section once it 's once the self-assessment tool is completed it 'd be recommended to have a look at this supportive resource section so you might not be doing well in certain areas you might be doing well in other areas but this this resource is quite extensive in terms of it 's broken down into those six categories again um for to make it easier for clubs to work out which area they might need supporting so we 've got provided some there 's ongoing changes um in terms of terminology it might suggest to touch base with council and we can send you the most up-to-date versions of whatever it is it might be um so again those are broken up into the specific categories that we had mentioned up above um then from there we 've just got your general other useful links um and you know it 's got link to change our game pride in sport vic health all of that sort of stuff um and the final section is the action plan so again you 've completed the the resource um so you 've completed the self-assessment with your club committee um where to from here so in terms of next steps um self-assessment is completed you 've had a look at the resources and you want to kind of work on what areas you you 'd like to improve so i guess it 's looking at which you could either decide to do it um you know pick three quick easy wins that you 'd like to get with some wings on the board um you specific area so you might want to focus on that particular area or you might want to pick you know one one or two um little statements that you can improve on one of each area so again it 's up to the club how they 'd like to to work on it this is just a basic template that we 've provided to be able to um just kind of get some ideas listed and and sort sort out who would be led by some um some due dates just to kind of get people on track with things um so that 's a very quickly run through that 's the tool again it will we 'll send it out to clubs um in the coming week or so um i guess uh what we 'd love uh is for everyone everyone who 's here today if you are part of a committee or a sporting club um staff member to take it back to your club if you 're a player or a parent advocate to your club to to work on this with us um and again along different parts of their journey so if if you 'd like to touch base with us um after receiving this tool you 're more than welcome to our contact details are on it throughout um but yeah we 're really looking forward to to um to assist in clubs work in this space so what i might do now is i 'll just go back to the powerpoint in terms of our next steps um and then i 'll ask if there 's any other questions um share share with them the work that we 're doing and encourage to start those conversations um so in terms of next steps again like i mentioned this this flyer that i 've got up here is just a bit of a call out for anyone that has already begun working in this space or um will be working in this space we 'd love to provide our clubs with some case studies so again this one here is around women and girls in sport but if you 've done anything in whether it be promotions of mental health and well-being healthy 'd love to hear from you about what it is that you 've done what outcomes you saw in the benefit to your club environment or if you 'd just like to shout out any specific volunteer that 's you know very inspiring um to the work that you 've done within your club we 'd love to hear so sent through any pictures a little blurb we create a case study like like we did with the the one that 's included and um our hope is to kind of have a bit of a collection of case studies to be able to share within our you know newsletters that go out um again just before wrapping up i just thought i 'd also do a little bit of a shout out in terms of um park is also running an international women 's day event directly after this so um basically it 's free registration starts at seven um you can do it from home it 's but it is a a me time flow so it 's a 30 minute yoga workout um and and stretching and 's day so i pop pop that up there and anyone was interested as well as a mental health matters workshop um which is a free one-and-a-half half-hour workshop that 's available to anyone that would like to participate um and it covers areas around mental health concerns and and what um what to do in in that instance so if you wanted to register to any of that um feel free to email that email address over there um and just like to say thank you again if there 's any questions about the tool or resource um happy to answer now um and then i might end it on showcasing that video so again thank you shani thank you for all our counselors and um ceo for attending as well today um any questions i 'll open it up you 're welcome to unmute if you like or pop it into the chat otherwise i shall share that video with you all so like i said this was um created last year with our sporting clubs in the region um we try to showcase clubs that have been as a bit of inspiration for other clubs to get on board as well so can everyone say that youtube i sometimes it doesn 't work in terms of sharing yeah awesome yeah i 'm gonna let me know or give me a thumbs up if you can hear with the volume [Music] i enjoy being able to play with a full girls team instead of sharing the field with boys here at council we believe that everyone should be able to participate in sport and physical activity in a welcoming and inclusive way and should be treated with respect and dignity free from discrimination we know that across victoria most women and girls do not do enough physical activity to benefit their health and well-being that is also the case here in franksy city it is also known that women and girls are less likely to participate in organized sports as they are more commonly experienced in multiple different types of barriers moving forward we are aiming to work with our local sporting clubs to create gender inclusive environments and welcoming clubs for all this in turn will lead staff leadership roles and officials [Music] here at frankston we believe the inclusion is our responsibility as a good community organisation it provides opportunities for people to make a difference in the community bringing all these young girls in has been fantastic brings in other family members which is really important with volunteers as well which um most clubs always struggle to get volunteers in so the more families we get involved the more people that are helping out and just makes it from a broader community based environment really my daughter was one that actually made me form a woman 's side and get a woman 's side because she plays to under 12s and then under 12 's over you can 't play with the boys anymore so we had nowhere to go apart from do nothing and i wasn 't not having that so that 's where i went down and reached out and started pushing numbers and i started off with going to a school one day tournament and i took seven girls down there they played and then i pretty much came back with 30 can 't sound so cliche but you really cannot be what you can 't see so in terms of having role models available and visible for younger players both boys and girls of all genders that 's the most critical thing i think for all of us and we have so many junior girls coming through now and filtering through the sandy club and so many girls now have taken on those leadership roles and have really led the way for years to come as a female coach it 's easier for the girls to connect with me and ultimately that makes them feel more comfortable because they can come and talk to me about things that they might not be able to do with a guy trying to draw women and boys together so there 's no difference you know they do all it 's one running hard to tackle is the tackling just as hard as the boys and the boys have more respect for the girls that you know they 're doing what they 're doing the very first step that i would recommend to any club is supportive of inclusion and not only supportive of it but can quantitatively measure the improvement in inclusion particularly involving women as seen by our local clubs and others working in this space it is common that inclusive clubs experience a range of benefits not only to the individuals but also the club itself therefore we are aiming to assist clubs provide welcoming environments so that they can be happy healthy and thriving [Music] thank you um yeah again thank you i just wanted to kind of show that at the end as a bit of a highlight um i really really hope that you guys enjoyed this evening and what i 'll do again as i mentioned throughout um throughout the week i 'll post um we 'll aiming to hopefully get this recording and send it out to everyone as well as the resources and tools so thanks again again any questions feel free to ask and i 'm happy to stick around in the chat i 'll also post the um that park link for anyone that wanted to join as a bit of a wind down everybody for joining _"

    "text": "good morning everybody and welcome to today 's gender inclusive sporting club workshop thank you everybody for tuning in my name is eva nicholas and i 'm a franklin city council recreation project officer and just before we move on to some of the workshop activities and and hearing more about what we intend to do here at council with the project i just wanted to briefly touch on a little bit of background information in terms of what we experience within um within here locally in terms of women and girls active participation in sport and physical activity so firstly a recent survey across victoria revealed that most females do not do enough physical activity to benefit their health and well-being and within this survey within frankston city council 48 of women were insufficiently active women are also less likely to participate in organized sport as they are more commonly experiencing multiple different types of barriers and research has shown that the more barriers that females perceive it 's it 's less likely they are to be active um although it is a although it is complex the good today to try and uh learn of what are some of the local barriers and some of the solutions that we could potentially work on together to overcome and getting more active participation across the sporting clubs late last year and earlier this year our recreation team had also worked with local sporting clubs and sent out a survey um to the committees around some demographic and other data that we were collecting as well and it was noted that although the population within frankston city council was approximately split up you know 51 49 um male female breakdown within uh the sporting club participation it was noted that only 39 of participants were female so another thing to note was male participation was also higher than female participation across all age age groups and that there was a significant decline in female participation around that adolescent age um although this isn 't uncommon across across the board in terms of what what is experience experience across victoria and nationally as well um we just wanted to kind of get some of that information to to kind of find out frankston now there has also been a lot of research in terms of the benefits of clubs of being inclusive by vic sport big health and and many other organizations and some of those benefits include experiencing increased membership and spectator numbers which in turn can then lead to an increased revenue and profit for the club um also by providing um an inclusive environment you 've got the opportunity to reach out and work with different businesses and sponsors and partners um by having a more you know a broader range of people within the community you 've got more connections that way as well and also it 's noted that by having um a variety and a diverse um sporting club community you know within the the committees you know coaches officials and board members it can actually make the club more dynamic because you 're bringing in different expertise and experiences and knowledge onto onto those committees and working groups so you 've got different views and opinions coming through that you may not not have necessarily had previously as well um just lastly before we move all ages genders sexual orientation ability cultural background ethnicity and life stages should all be able to participate in sport and physical activity in a welcoming and inclusive way so therefore a part of our work today is to try and um to chat to clubs around you know cultures um and environments and and hearing what are the barriers and potential solutions that we can work on with you with you all to to create a more welcoming club moving forward we we intend to utilize this information captured today and to create a bit of a tailored audit tool um and some resources as well for clubs to be able to determine where they 're currently at in this space and how they might be able to take some take some actions to overcome some of these barriers and overall in in hopes in doing so we hope to um be able to support clubs and assist clubs in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment which will therefore um see an increase in women and girls participating in local sporting clubs here across frankston so now moving on our change our game ambassador tal cup so tal is an olympian lawyer and organizational strategist and in her early years she was balancing a legal career um within a with elite sport as well as representing australia as a member of the matilda so the australian women 's soccer team she competed in fifa women 's world cup the athens olympic games as well as captained melbourne victory in the in the w league um in her early years tal was also the only girl in an all-male league and as well as tell having many other roles within sporting club space which we 'll touch on a little bit more within our chat with tell so tell thank you and welcome for welcome today and thank you for being with us so i just wanted to firstly ask um what was it like being the only female in the boys premier league competition look i loved it i loved the game of football and i spent a decade doing it um from 7 to 17 before relocating to canberra i grew up in perth to try and make the challenge but there were probably a few maybe three things that i particularly remember of that time that that might maybe um aren 't so ideal and that the first part i think is is really feeling persistently judged i felt like i had to be better than good enough um to validate that i belong to disprove what i thought everybody there already thought and that was that girls can 't play which is obviously not true but that 's what i felt that i was i was battling the second i actually felt ashamed at times that i was doing something that i wasn 't supposed to do and therefore i was making it so much harder for everybody else around me the players the parents the organizers and that kind of felt like a bit of a heavy toll to bear i remember hiding behind my dad 's legs in those early days and just didn 't want to come out behind them until the game got underway it felt a bit scary but it was also something that i really wanted to do um the reflected on more recently and it 's probably the most interesting of those reflections and that is deep down i actually liked being the only girl deep down i actually and and this is a bit it feels a bit shameful to say now i didn 't want other girls in the team i felt more successful somehow i felt that if other girls were to get in they needed to be like me they had to fight like i did um and the point i want to make here is unconsciously even as a small child i was supporting the very system that excluded people like me i didn 't want to blow it up i just wanted to fit in it i saw football as a game that boys played if i played i had to be like the boys and that 's just how it was and in effect i was kind of lifting up the ladder behind me um it doesn 't make me bad i was seven but it 's the theme of unconscious bias that i think is really interesting to reflect on regardless us good or bad we 've all been socially accustomed because of the way that we 've grown up to assume that men do certain things and women do certain things and and maybe that 's a theme either if there 's time i might keep touching on because it 's so important that we reflect on our role um to make sure that we don 't hold ourselves back but also don 't hold other people back in our sporting club environments for sure thank you and we 've got some we 've got a question in the chat which i 'd like to we 'll get to at the end but i just wanted to mention as well if anyone else has got any questions feel free to put them in the chat and we 'll try and answer as much as we can um so tell what was some of your career highlights as a football player either you mentioned it before um and that was the world cup so i told you that my dream as that seven-year-old watching that television set was to make the i only saw men on tv there weren 't women on tv there weren 't women playing on football fields around me um there was just an absence of that but then finally um after deciding that that 's what i wanted to do from such a young age getting to 2003 and that was still a long time ago gosh i 'm showing my age but um i i made it to the world cup after years of training hard beat tests fitness tests strength tests relocating to canberra away from everybody i knew from birth at 17 years of age it was just an incredible moment to know that i had made it to that team it was a different era you might remember in 2003 with battling sars now it 's covered our competition was suddenly moved from china to the us and i remember counting down the days um before everyone got on this screen we were talking about how athletes often have calendars of sleeps before a big competition and i remember counting down the days to the world cup and thinking back on all from that early age of seven um and then i actually remember going to the us and going to that first game at the home depot center in carson california and i was walking out under the pitch with my teammates we kind of hold hands as we walk out and there 's this fifa theme music playing in the background and i had my parents and my late grandparents in the stand and i just had this overwhelming feeling of of pride i guess that that i made it and that i did it regardless of what other people thought i was capable of but if i come back to that theme of unconscious bias i actually also felt gratitude um and i want to talk about that just briefly i was just so grateful to play for my country um to to wear green and gold to be supported to play overseas when others before me had to pay to play i didn 't actually think about equal pay and equal conditions it wasn 't a conversation back then we didn 't expect any of that i know back then it was a rite of passage to come back for many of my colleagues from the world cup and join the dole queue they had to live with their parents to stay afloat i moved to eight different rental accommodation locations in three years to stay around so the point is um that you know we just was so busy trying to fit into the system that existed that didn 't necessarily support us in the way that it supported our male colleagues that we didn 't battle it and what i think is so great about this conversation and either you spoke to about it before is we need to actually have a good look at ourselves and figure out what it is that we need to do to make sure that both men and women and and everybody um regardless of their gender identity or characterization is included in in what we do yeah um so we 've also got lots of different uh you know range of people in the room as as simone mentioned you know committee staff and all that sort of stuff your professional career as a player what are the roles did you partake in in sport as well look initially after my career and i left football at 23 because when i was playing there wasn 't a professional career for women it 's wonderful that that 's starting to change for some but when i was growing up you had to get serious about your life if you wanted to have a career that might support you and your family moving forward so i left football at a really early age to throw myself into a legal career and i decided initially that i didn 't want to retain football at that time i wanted to be known for what i did on you know in the law and the courtroom with white the white line fever of the courtroom as opposed to the football field for a while but after a time i realized and it 's probably why a number of you were involved in sport that there is just such power involved in being sport involved in sport and supporting participation and i really wanted to and help things move forward um and so i 've been involved in a lot of roles i 've been a coach i 've been a sports administrator i 've been a board member and i 've been a commentator and maybe if i just quickly reflect on on commentating at the last women 's world cup it was actually this really surreal experience i was sitting there on the optus couch talking about this game that that i 've been so obsessed about forever and i was watching all of these amazing athletes from around the world who were just like me who had j you know exactly well similar stories about breaking through and following their passion and and the realization for me so many years on was that i wasn 't so different it just was that i hadn 't seen these powerful role models before so just how powerful it is is it for you know those young people to look up and see these great women playing football whether it 's at the world cup or whether it 's at your local playing fields in actually see themselves reflected and and so that they can aspire to to be something and if they don 't feel like they 're going against the grain which was something that i always overwhelmingly had the impression of so there 's there 's plenty that i 'm still doing in sport i 'm really passionate about it awesome um we 've got a few more minutes i think i might incorporate one of my last questions with um with one that was in the chat and then we can open it up um for a few more as well so just talking around barriers um and and potentially how you overcame those in in the sporting space and we 've also got a question in the chat around do you think one of the barriers might be that members in the club are not aware of their own behaviors between themselves and others that are coming into the club um what yeah what would you think about that and how to kind of overcome overcome those barriers yeah so maybe that last reflection first i think all of us bias particularly unconscious bias is absolutely prevalent and so that 's why i keep touching it on it in this conversation because we 're doing a lot of talking about people 's stories and gender equality at the moment but i think we we sometimes always think that it 's about what happens outside this room or it 's just about what decision makers are doing and we forget it 's about what we do every day it 's about what everybody around us does every day so we really need to start thinking about what it is that we might be contributing to the status quo that excludes certain people but also when other people are doing it what sort of ways can we bring them into the conversation in a non-intimidating way and i think sport is such a great way to do that to bring them in to say how can we change this so it 's better for everybody for the very reasons of inclusivity that you spoke to before eva but when you talk about barriers generally i just can 't go past talking about 't been what other people have decided i 'm capable of um and there 's been a lot of people throughout my career who 've told me what i can and cannot do it 's actually what i tell myself i can and cannot do and self-doubt has forever been that crippling force that paralyzes me and it still does and i 'm sure for many people in the room um that it might as well and there are so many examples i remember one in particular um it was my hsc year and um i finally got into my first traveling international team and i put so much pressure on myself that i just played hopelessly i won 't go into that story given given the time implications but when you put so much pressure on yourself and you start to really doubt your performance it starts off feeling like you know like a little kid tugging against your sleeve and ultimately starts feeling like after a while like it just paralyzes you and and sometimes i can play or i played feeling like i had two left feet took me one step further back and i 've learned over time how to deal with it in a more productive way and it 's the same of if i 'm in a courtroom or in a boardroom um that sometimes i read i really need to to slow down and and there are a few steps that i take one is i think it 's really important to reframe challenges like that big competition in the netherlands that i spoke to before it 's important to reframe those as opportunities because it allows you to loosen up and feel more creative there is something to be said about putting on a game face so if you 're stepping up to a penalty at a huge international competition you can 't tell the world that you 're afraid and that you 're worried that you 're going to stuff this up you have to project that you 're going to nail that penalty and there 's something about priming yourself to look that way that actually makes you feel that way and i do the same thing when i 'm other thing that sport really told me is and people talk about getting comfortable with discomfort but i actually say train for it because i think that also helps you in time of times of doubt and ultimately when you do stuff up you need to pick yourself up and and one of the ways that i do that is to make sure i have a really good team around me because sometimes i just can 't see beyond myself i start really um internalizing how crap i think i am in respect of something and sometimes i do need other people to pull me out and then a bit of time and space goes by and i 'm able to to readjust and reacquaint myself and i find often with a number of women as well as men in sport we can sometimes really get stuck in that headspace so maybe some of those tips might help definitely thank you so much tal and just in light of time we might um begin moving on we do have a few other questions in the um the chat i 'm in that um just so those people don 't miss out but thank you so much for um telling us a bit about your story and your experiences that was yeah really great insight morning everyone my name is zoe francis and i 'm the acting health promotion manager from women 's health in the southeast um so this is the section um this morning where we 're gonna move to hear from you and just a bit of a lead-in first so i 'll be joined in a moment by my colleague um katrina nurse so we 'll be facilitating together with our colleagues from um frankston city council the next part of today so um we 're from women 's health in the southeast um women 's health in the southeast is a the largest agency i guess in our region which works to promote the health of women and girls in our region and we work to enable communities to implement gender equality in a variety of settings absolutely including sports obviously and we work to prevent gender-based violence and to promote optimum sexual and reproductive health you 've covered off why it 's important we all know why it 's important super transformative the effect of sport i think particularly in our country is so powerful and it provides an opportunity um together with the outdoors and physical activity generally to really transform our culture in this country it 's an opportunity to provide and promote participation and leadership of women in sport and we 're really excited to be here today and to unpack exactly how we 're going to improve that work in our community so um in moving towards um this section i 'm just gonna acknowledge that um this work is really important because it 's about unpacking those restrictive gender roles that have kind of been assigned to women and traditionally and this is obviously why we 're here today to help really see that shift in our communities and why is that important it 's really important because as you mentioned before tell that kind of unconscious bias or even um behaviors that are disrespectful whether somebody 's aware of it or not are actually the drivers for discrimination and power and control so we 're not here today to talk about family violence it 's really important to note that this is not a safe space and to do that today but it 's just really important to point out um and reiterate why this work is so very important so in having mentioned family violence um it is really important to make sure that if you do feel triggered in any way by anything in today 's session that you do reach out for support reiterating that this is not a space today to share any lived experiences of disrespect or violence but that there absolutely is fantastic help out there for you to seek so on the left there there 's the number for 1 800 respect which is our national sexual assault and domestic violence counselling service the number there on the left in the center there you 've got men 's line australia and so that 's for any men who are concerned about their own behavior or other men 's behavior and on the right safe steps which is um crisis support so what inclusive club so when you registered for today 's session and we asked you what you think an inclusive club looks like so here are some of the answers that i 've dropped into the slide and i won 't run through them but what i will do is just kind of theme them out if that 's okay so what we heard and was when it comes to values what you want to see values wise is that you want clubs in frankston to be welcoming to be um hold women and and people of all genders and diversities in high value to be accepting to be respectful to be inviting and to be a safe space where people of all abilities are celebrated i think as well a key theme that came through was um moving those barriers that we talked about earlier so um making sure that the clubs are a safe space for people of all genders races sexual orientations and abilities and that there is a gender balance so from on the field off the field um and obviously um yeah in on the field and then i think the last thing that came through for me was um yeah that element of it being some somewhere that we can all go to in our community and be an outlet somewhere we can get fit um and including for children as well safe space more of the comments that we picked up um in your registration okay so this is the bit where we stop talking and we start listening to you so i 'm going to hand over now and stop sharing my screen to my colleague katrina nurse and who 's going to move us through a bit of an activity um with uh using slido so if you 've got your mobile phones please grab them because you will need them for this next session katrina thanks zoe thanks very much and hello everyone as zoe mentioned i 'm also from women 's health in the south east i 'm the health promotion officer in the prevention of violence against women and we 'll be leading this exciting activity with slido um so hoping that maybe some of you have used the and easy to use so what we 're going to do is use um slido for some interactive polling so all you will need as we mentioned is your smartphone to use the qr code which i 'm about to put on the screen yep okay so if you just take your phone up to that qr code we 're all very familiar how to use these qr codes now and we have to do that into in every shop that we walk into um that will take you to um an an app which you don 't need to sign into or create an account so it 's pretty easy and then the link in the qr will drop you into the poll so here we 're going to ask you to think about what motivates and encourages participation and the barriers and challenges to participation both on and off the field so through the use of this sort of clever tool you can contribute your ideas which will be displayed in real time um onto a shared virtual work word cloud so it will make a little bit it would be an opportune time to actually ask people um before we did this if this type of format um is is is um a format that people would prefer um or whether they would prefer an um an in-person event so initially this was going to be an in-person event so i thought i 'll just add that into the beginning of the poll and um see how we go so um we just go forward one so as you can see here and you 'll be able to see on your devices um the poll is being launched so if you just vote on on there it 'll start to show us for this first question which format you would prefer for this type of event okay so you can see people voting there that 's great the online formats catching up this is exciting like a bit of a race going on oh i know it is okay when do you call it that 's the thing um and this is obviously in the basis that um you know we have covered restrictions or no covert could meet in person it looks like that people would prefer to meet in person it 's looking like it 's sort of evened itself out there so thank you for that we 'll move on to the next question um and the next one is um what do you think motivates and encourages active participation on the field um of women and girls at all levels in sporting clubs so what we 're talking about here is um on the field so that 's playing coaching um refereeing umpiring development opportunities as well and even people like physios or allied health um you know water carriers what what helps people you 've got about an 80 character limit here so you can type in more than sort of one word if you 're wanting to and as you can see they 're starting to come up on the screen here yep that 's great and you 'll see that the way that this works is you can see there the friends and social interaction is bigger and the reason that 's bigger is it 's starting to theme out to to make them um bigger so that the more people that are putting in something that 's similar it will bring those to the foreign that 's great okay i think we 're we 've probably nearly got most of our thoughts on that poll so we will move to um the next one so the next one is more around we 're talking about on the field still but we 're wanting to ask you what you think are the challenges and barriers to active participation on the field so what are those things that make it more difficult for women and girls to participate on the field i can hear somebody 's birdies in the background [Music] maybe that can 't_''_1787.039 be what you can 't see that 's a goodie it is indeed yeah that modelling and around the work commitments too is an interesting one whether that 's got to do with the timing um of some of the requirements in terms of on the field active participation yep child care and being your mum 's coming through as well keeping family commitments seeing other as you said so you can 't_''_1825.36 be what you can 't see yeah that one 's interesting not socially valued brackets luxury women coaching yeah that 's a really interesting one um often you find even in um you know some of the the younger development opportunities where you 're doing ozkick or some of those types of programs or dribblers you know for younger children um you often see that although there 's not particular requirements in terms of skill to run those sessions you don 't have to be an expert it 's more about you know sort of hurting the kids and giving them some basic skills even in um where you 've got girls on the field there you tend to always have um the dads who are the ones who are helping out so for girls looking around all they can see is um you know the dads who are helping out which is obviously fabulous but it would be nice to encourage some female participation there as well so that those girls can also see their moms and other women involved in it here so these ones will seem a little repetitive but what we 're looking at here is off the field so we 're talking about um what motivates and encourages active participation off the field so that 's volunteering roles club committee membership um some of those technical support type roles as well so um in more of the elite level in community sport you 're looking at statistics and time keeping um so yeah just getting involved in that off the field space oh yeah that 's interesting that their partner or kids are at the club is kind of a lead-in motivation yeah kids are at a club yeah great these are fabulous suggestions that are coming through here and ideas and as eva said will be used to really start to unpack this and share with clubs across the region okay how are we going yeah being asked there you go and that and that encouragement i think it 's a big thing coming through there that authentic want from leaders in the club or yeah and often it 's about tapping into into that as well have fabulous skill sets and it 's just a matter of tapping in and actually tapping them on the shoulder and saying you know look we know that you 're um you have expertise and you know you 're a lawyer or you 're an event manager or um you know you have this an accounting background or whatever it is we really need someone to help here you know do you have the time to get to the club okay okay and the last question lucky last is um the challenges and barriers to active participation off the field so what are those things that um uh you know make it difficult for women to women and girls to get involved light committee meetings yeah that 's an interesting one too yeah i think on the blokey culture just to note that um you know that 's certainly a piece of work because that potentially the clubs could move to to do the work around engaging men and boys in gender equality and just how many benefits there are for for men themselves in terms of breaking away from through quite strongly the blokey culture the time kind of the two key themes there yeah yeah so it 's not about just getting women into the club women and girls into the club it 's actually about making sure that the culture is one they 're going to want to stay with okay and there 's a bit of a theme here as well which tail talked about around worrying you 'll get it wrong or men doubting your ability or feeling valued so again it 's that um women and girls um sort of feeling like you know having that that fear of of really just getting stuck in and being judged yet which comes back to the need for encouragement fantastic okay well these are fabulous and i hope everyone has um really enjoyed using that slido tool um it is actually i 'll just give slido a plug it is a free tool so um you too can create one of these for your next meeting um okay what i will do is i will just stop sharing my screen for the moment okay great um really um valuable to capture all of that information i mean as i said frankston city council will be using that so now we 're at a stage where we 're actually going to divide everyone up into four separate breakout rooms so each of these rooms will be facilitated um by either a frankston city council staff member so either or simone and zoe and i so you 'll stay in your allocated room for the next 20 minutes or so and you will explore detail two of the four areas below so what we 're going to look at is club culture so you know what the club feels like in terms of that culture that 's created club memberships and engagement club leadership and club facilities so in these groups we want to explore and unpack the collective wisdom in the room and help tease out how we can create more inclusive clubs for women and girls so we really encourage you to put forward your ideas and and then we 'll bring everyone back into the main room and we 'll just do a quick wrap ready to finish up so and but the goal of this project is get some sort of tangible outputs um that we get like a tool kit and a framework that will um be able to be accessed by all clubs they 'll help give them a sort of solution based framework and that they can run an assessment to see where their gaps are and and have some tangibles at how they might make those improvements um we know that having women and girls in clubs is great on lots of levels about gender equality but it 's great for clubs there 's a whole lot of extra participants out there extra volunteers um that we can get on board and bring into the clubs as well so um so we think it 's win-win for everyone but uh so again thank you so much for your time this morning i really appreciate you taking your time out of your day to be here um and uh and we 'll certainly keep you informed of how we progress and um and hopefully keep you involved in the process you _"

somewhat but i 'm sure once we get out of lockdown we can do some photo opportunities and make a real good song and dance out of it but i want to thank the officers for making this a reality it really is impossible to put a human value on the contribution of volunteers in franklin city but i 'm truly pleased to see leaders of our community joining us today because we understand that it is crucial to acknowledge the good work that our volunteers do before the pandemic we know that a remarkable 17 000 volunteers were active here in frankston giving more than 2 million hours of their time every year and if you put that into a cost figure you just couldn 't put a cost on it key council programs given up around 55 800 hours of their time to help others as we continue to build strength in our community during the recovery phase we 'll be wanting those volunteers by our side and hopefully returning to volunteerism i 'm honored today to express gratitude on behalf of frankston city but also to introduce some of the people who will inspire others to take on a volunteer role or to pay it forward in a meaningful way the people we recognize today have acted on their beliefs in a very real and practicable way committing themselves to support others in need over a long period of time i 'd now like to introduce you to our five winners for service 2 community the award goes to guru glen cooper better known as guru glenn congratulations glenn thank you virtual club glenn um has supported those dealing with the challenges of mental health and disability to feel more connected to their

this award to hannah sweninson now hannah has been a a need to respond to the sort of social isolation that many are experiencing as a result of kovac over 19. so what i really appreciated about hannah is that she acknowledged from the very beginning that social isolation had been occurring well before covert 19. um although covert 19 had made the situation a lot worse along with a group of friends she created the closed facebook page called young people with a purpose that allows members to stay connected with others and share their experiences in a safe environment the page also raises awareness of support services and how to engage with them during lockdown using guidance from those maintaining the frankston community connect site including glenn hanna 's work with others has brought individuals together around a purpose and given them a comfortable way to access supports that may have seemed out of their reach otherwise thank you very much hannah did you want to say a few words um thank you i just want to say thank you and um i just wanted to express how much this award means to me and the team and um he 's been a massive support for me and everyone else and josh just katie and the people that have supported us throughout our weekly as four nightly zoo meetings new forums plus everyone in the community supporting us and making this happen thank you good on you hannah you 're a legend uh hannah and glenn uh the work that you both do is amazing and you know please keep doing it we need you and the city definitely needs you at this time so thank you both so much for the next award leadership this award goes to andrew mayling congratulations andrew andrew is the driving force behind the pines men 's shed that has provided a welcoming community and purposeful activities for men in franklin city for the past decade the skills and craftsmanship that have developed within this group have been put to good use in the frankston community and can be seen in the pines community gardens and some of our parks behind the scenes the well-being and mental health of those in the group is integral to everyone that is created under andrew 19 restrictions interrupting activity andrew has been instrumental in staying in touch with members to ensure the values espoused by the program are still front and center andrew thank you for all that you do did you want to say a few words i feel humble to receive this award but it would not be possible without strong support from the committee and the members of our shed the pines med shed up is set up predominantly to support men 's health to assist our members from social isolation and to give them a purpose in life it also consists of friendship camaraderie which are promoted to the other community but mainly i would like to thank franklin city council for their ongoing support both financially and the backing of the menship and particular extra guidance and advice from ken like the community 's liaison officer thank you very much andrew i was just saying um uh that the council 's recently uh stepped up for some upgrades at the shed so hopefully they can they can happen very soon but well done for all the work that you 've next award uh this falls under the initiative category and this award goes to anne clair congratulations anne and is not only a hard-working volunteer she is also someone who has enabled other volunteers to connect with agencies in frankston city that keenly need them working with impact volunteering and has shown herself to be resilient and adaptable in meeting the challenges that cobit 19 has posed she has refreshed the processes needed to connect volunteers and agencies she has also shifted the focus of volunteers no longer permitted to do face-to-face work and i believe that there are many in nursing homes for example who have been introduced to ipads and now enjoying video calls it is a credit to you anne that you were nominated externally for this award so well done anne did you want to say a few words thank you yes i would i just wanted to say thank you very much for this award i am really honored to be amongst this

and forth as as is paul peter or paul do you have any anything you might like to say uh thank you chris that 's um a lovely opportunity and i i 'm glad rebecca 's also in the car so i 'm not the only person swimming in from the car um all i want to say is you know i am so proud to know work that you 've all done for the community and as rebecca said and i know this about each and every one of you none of you have done it for the credit that you 've all done it for love of community um and the pandemic has been really horrible in so many ways and has caused need but has identified need but i tell you the really positive thing to come out of the pandemic is actually how strong our community is and how many people are there to help each other and you all epitomise that so you 're all legends and thank you frankston city council for doing this and for doing it um chris i 'm so pleased that you could do it via zoom while you 're the mayor um and thank you for all the work you 've done to support these local groups no worries we 've all done it together peter all three tiers and i think that 's something to be proud of uh paul are you are you available are you busy debating legislation uh i 've got a uh frankston council first of all for um their efforts today and uh obviously yourself chris you do a bloody fantastic job um i 'll keep it really short because um peter is very eloquent in her words and i think was pretty succinct in that i think i 've met every every one of you who 's received an award today and i think uh you 're you 've really built up um a new stereotype for franks and i think over the last couple of years where franks and um the frankston community and franks and volunteers punch well above their weight in how we keep our community together and how we um rise to the occasion and adapt and overcome when it comes to something like covert but even prior to covered you know when we had um people coming on a ship into western port from fire prone areas uh on the border there um the amount of people that just came to us and said how do we help um and yeah it 's quite an amazing thing and i think maybe we don 't we need our community is until we have these really troubling times uh trying time sorry like covered um so congratulations to each and every one of you um there 's no more deserving people than you today for these awards and and keep up the great work thank you paul and thanks peter and i 'm sorry to put you both on notice but i 'm you both spoke from the heart it was wonderful uh so what 'll happen from here on um and tim and c were probably pulling the hair out as i 'm saying this um once we get out of lockdown it 'll be great to actually have a bit of a have a reception bring you in and have some morning tea and get some photos i 'd love to do that and i think you definitely deserve it i know glenn you don 't like photos and all that stuff but you know we as peter said it 's about leading by example and as volunteers i think you 're shining examples and it 'd be lovely to highlight the work that get out of lockdown nudge nudge paul um and uh look thank you all so much from phil to jill to tim to sue to the frankston city council staff thank you for organizing today and to our members of parliament and most importantly our volunteers keep up the great work thank you everyone you _"

    "text": "the opportunity to speak with us um she holds a degree in music and journalism and is a published author and a winston churchill fellow who has traveled the globe examining diversity gender equality and storytelling she is also the first and only woman to have officiated in an australian football league grand final uh chelsea has unpardoned more than 265 afl games 16 finals and has been the emergency umpire at five afl grand finals thank you for joining us this morning chelsea and welcome to today 's gender inclusive workshop thanks eva really happy to be here i 'm really appreciative people have jumped on the call early morning awesome thank you so can you start uh start off by telling us a little bit about your journey and how was it that you actually got into umpiring look i was a footy fanatic growing up um i probably had my thumb in a lot of pies as a as a girl so i really enjoyed music i was into my academics i love different sports so i used to play basketball swimming athletics all that sort of used to play footy as well so um stepping into umpiring was really just a way to to get closer to the game and i did that through initially volunteering in high school um you know they needed someone to wave the flags for the boys teams and i thought it seemed like something that was really fun to do i was in year 12 at the time there was a lot of serious stuff going on you know serious study all this talk about you know what what am i doing with my future and i just felt umpiring was something that would offer me a little bit of fun um and it turned out to offer some really good challenges as well so um as i as i had a taste i discovered you know all the elements that come into umpiring and it was a really um i think part of it was just this idea of every decision is different so you 're constantly having to readjust your positioning your reading of the play you 're learning all these different skills to to make good decisions young person and then of course you know getting paid when i joined the local association up in brisbane getting paid um was a pretty good option as well to make good decisions and be around football and that 's how it it sort of began for me awesome and um just just growing up what was it like being you know one of the only females in a predominantly back then what would have been a predominant male role yeah it 's um it 's interesting i think up in in brisbane that was probably an advantage of starting up there when i showed up to training for the first time um there were probably half a dozen girls there who were involved girls and women i should say who were involved with footy in the different disciplines the field boundary or goal umpiring so while we were still you know very very much the minority um it 's sort of i wasn 't the only one at training it was probably more when i started to climb the ranks and get elevated you know to state league and become became much more a case of me being potentially the only woman at training the only woman sort of stepping into that environment and particularly you know obviously with afl i was the second woman in history to umpire at that level and the only woman at that time on the list and so um at that stage things get pretty serious the the training requirements um you know when i joined we had to do beep tests get our skin folds taken regularly um we did we got tested for our speed and agility as well as our endurance so we used to come back from christmas and start training in january and we had time trials and so we 'd have to run distances anywhere from between 1500 meters up to 5k and all of these little things none of them were done with the mind mindset of acknowledging that you know there 's a female there and she might have different physiology to confront these challenges it was all just a blanket benchmark blanket expectation um and so for me it was something that i was really have to work hard and make sure that i was earning my position and that 's probably i reflect on that now and i think that 's an unfortunate mindset to have but it was the mindset that i needed at the time to get through some of these these things and make sure i was you know i guess just getting the best out of myself and getting the results that i needed yeah for sure um so i mentioned in your little intro you 've got long list of achievements what would be some of your career highlights as an umpire i reflect on a lot of the the opportunities that i 've had around hiring it really has opened doors for me um one of the biggest things is probably the travel and not only in australia you know being able to do games um anywhere from darwin and cairns up in the north down to tasmania um i 've done finals over in perth uh i 've you know umpired at the mcg you know one of our best the world 's best sporting stadiums australia and and i guess the privilege of being out there on the ground um but also internationally so i 've done a game in london there was an exhibition match in london several years ago that fortunately i got the chance to do i vampired in shanghai for the the uh the match port adelaide premiership game so just travel has been a huge thing i sort of think about i 'm playing the grand final was just an amazing experience um you know 100 000 fans 10 point ball game so um that was in 2012 it was sydney hawthorne um it was an incredibly close match right to the end and the opportunity to be there for those moments um it just it 's you 're totally in the moment you 're totally present and you 're just enveloped by the excitement of the crowd and i love that feeling of you know the adrenaline of being front row center to the game and and ultimately i think it 's those moments in games you know like you 're standing on the goal line you can hear know by a fingernail kind of thing or you can um i had i don 't know if anyone watched um shy bolton 's shay bolton 's mark from richmond 's a few weeks ago it was this incredible mark he took in the goal square um and i was just behind it so you know a couple of meters away and it 's it 's those moments in games where you just think wow i 'm in a really privileged position and it 's just really cool awesome yeah that one i could only imagine um so you you kind of mentioned it a little bit at the start in in terms of you know the differences in in the training um and all that sort of thing so what were some of the the other barriers that you you may have faced growing up and and you know in that training sense and um trying to compete at that level uh as an alpine and how did you overcome these i think probably there i sort of think of you know challenges and i look at my personality really up for the challenge if that makes sense so um i probably for for a long time was very much a perfectionist and that 's very it 's kind of suited to the role of umpiring because everyone expects you to be perfect um i 've since you know received treatment for that but um it 's just one of those things where it 's so technical and you wouldn 't even think you wouldn 't know until you sort of step into a training environment with something like goal umpiring you think well how complicated can it get but um the way that we are monitored and scrutinized not just externally but internally and the way we 're assessed is just it 's is really intense and it 's often from a lot of different camera angles um you know we 'll be in a training session and um there there 'll be some vision from a decision then they 'll stop it and they 'll look at the frame by frame sort of analysis of were you at the line on time was your head still were sort of stuff so um for me a lot of that while it seemed so technical and um a little bit over the top that really appealed to me and and i think that 's another reason that sort of some of these other challenges really appealed like i was really up for that idea that um well you 're a female you 're different or this somewhere somewhere having along the line this idea of having to prove yourself um so i was i had that sense of of wanting to work harder train harder just not being any doubt about my credibility um so i think some of the other elements that arose were things like the the political processes around selection so if you can imagine it 's like being selected for a team you 're sort of expected to be part of a team but you 're all competing against each other um to be appointed so um that was something for me especially being highlighted as someone who was different the media might highlight me you know as opposed to my colleagues and i found as an umpire you 're expected to go under the radar so i was really conscious of trying to go under the radar but not being able to um and also you know enjoying that element of you know oh hey i 'm getting attention i 'm going to prove that i 'm capable so it was sort of a really interesting dynamic there um i mentioned the training requirements um [Music] i think also it 's just taken me quite a bit of energy and work to to really stay firm in my my sense of self belief um you know at times that might have been questioned um but i look back and i i think over time i 've learnt to value my strengths and i 've learned to value the strengths that might come from my femininity or the feminine side um instead of sort of feeling like i have to adapt all the time and fit into this template of what 's expected of goal umpiring which has always been masculine and to give you an example of that uh so i used to do and um it 's really interesting the sort of training we do now involves a lot of footwork change of direction agility we run a lot around cones and sometimes we 'll do these exercises that are quite complicated with the patterns of footwork and i 'll do a bit of that and i just think man i 'm i 'm doing okay here like and i think it goes back to that some of those you know really feminine type activities that i would have done growing up that i never really connected the dots um and i 've just started connecting the dots a lot more now and really started to value you know my strengths as a person and understanding that yeah i have things to offer um that might come from that my feminine experience um so i guess moving forward here at cancer we 're obviously trying to look to assist clubs in creating more welcoming environments just just wanted to ask you why do you think it 's important to have equity across a sporting club you know from players through to leadership roles few reasons um firstly it shows everybody what 's expected uh equity sets the standard you know for the respect and the values that enable inclusion to flourish but i think it 's really important to remember it 's actually about the whole club flourishing and reminding people of that and educating people around that um you know equity sets the standard and it also i think connects the dots a bit between fairness and performance um and what i mean by that is i think sometimes there 's still this overarching sense that equality is some sort of concession um or look it 's a fair thing to do but and it 's based on compliance rather than hey there are actually some really great benefits from alternative approaches um we need to understand how diversity helps the business um and i think when we when we really look at those issues we start to i think diffuse this idea that merit is a part of the discussion because i think merit becomes this issue that um i think we can get bogged down in it you know i what 's the criteria that 's going to help us to be more diverse who is the sort of person who can provide that input i think we start to get a much better idea of you know why we need to to do things a bit differently um and so and i think ultimately the fundamental thing is that sport really opens up to everybody when when there 's equity um you know we all we often hear it talked about doesn 't everyone deserve the opportunity to be physically active and connected to their bodies and experience all the great things that come from sport um so i think the holistic benefits beyond just being competitive or beyond just winning become really important in that aspect and they 're just as relevant um and so you know equity can really bring that mindset into sport and physical wreck for sure thank you and just before i open it up for any other questions i 've got one more so if anyone has any questions for chelsea that either like to put in the chat or opportunity to ask to to start putting some questions the last question i had chelsea was just in terms of uh next steps moving forward what would you say for clubs so um you know obviously a first step is great that they 're all here today what what 's some next steps that clubs could do moving forward i often think about um i don 't think it 's necessarily a lack of support for inclusive principles that prevents action i think sometimes it 's just it 's kind of overwhelming thinking about where to begin and what exactly to do and particularly with sporting clubs we rely a lot on volunteers or people who may be in a very part-time capacity and so it can be those little things that actually make a really big difference i know from my experience one of the biggest issues i 've had throughout the years um that was seemed so trivial that i would just not worry about it was uniforms that fit and even the pants that i wore for the afl grand final so this was eight years after being on the camping store because i had to go and find a pair of female cut pants um to match the tone for the for the guys and i mean that 's just you think about that that actually seems ridiculous um i mean same with footy boots so our uniform um our footy boots have to be black um and it 's actually funnily enough really hard to find female footy boots that are black um and so i 've always just had to to go out to find your quality ones um and just and just buy the the guys boots which are just sort of bigger in the heel and they 're a bit clumpy and you know we 're expected here to be presenting well moving well so it 's those little things um and that 's just one example but i think often it 's those ripple effects from the little things and action is always better than in action um but it 's being in that environment of understanding no one 's perfect we 're all humans um intention can actually go a long way but really important to remember that um i think sometimes it 's as easy as just starting with the environment doing a bit of an audit um and just asking questions what is going to optimize participation who can we go to to understand um what people want and it 's not about just who you 've got currently it 's who are we trying to attract um in in terms of potential members um it 's making sure things go beyond being tokenistic um so you know what 's it going to take not only for people to survive but for people to thrive and just really asking that question um but i think ultimately it 's also remembering the individual so um you know the term intersectionality comes up a bit um understanding that you know um there 's actually diversity within gender for example yeah and so not making an assumption that one woman is going to represent all women um it 's just coming back to you know respecting the individual for their views and their experience so there might be someone you 're trying to attract that person and their life experience can actually enhance the role um and showing some flexibility around that definitely and yeah it 's it 's um funny how you mentioned the the uniform kind of aspect because there was a that recent um uh research that just came out and then i can 't remember the statistic and figure particularly um off the top of my head but it 's it basically just implied that you know there 's a lot of dropout rates so that 's that 's one of the major barriers that kind of um women and girls uh kind of state is the fact that you know the uniforms not fitting well and you know not feeling comfortable in the uniform is a major barrier to them and actually participating so yeah it 's it 's crazy how it 's still kind of um still kind of going on but hopefully that 's you know one little thing that we can start changing and improving to to reduce that barrier and increase participation totally i sort of just you reminded me of another little story i got issued um some shirts and new shirts um and i 'm not sure what must have been a color thing we 've had lots of different colored shirts in the past for uniforms and i just remember getting this thing and looking at and going this is ridiculous and i just decided that i was going to wear it and lo and behold one of the high up footy operations executive people saw me and just said that doesn 't look good like actually they commented to someone else from up in the box and um yeah from there and then i was sort of instructed can you go and tailor that shirt sort of thing anyway it 's it 's funny yeah awesome all right thank you so much for um that insight i 'd like to now open it up so if anyone in the room or zoom had any questions um you 're welcome to unmute if you 'd like or if you prefer you can pop it into the chat box um anything for chelsea that you 'd like to ask so i 'll put ask a question i 'll pop it in the chat i 'm happy to write it out as well i 've got a question if that 's okay either um chelsea have you noticed an increase in girls wanting to referee um seeing you i guess on the on the global stage like even i 've i haven 't followed footy religiously but even i remember you i 'm praying for the grand final and i don 't remember any other umpire do you think it 's made a difference thanks amanda um look i do i do believe there 's that there 's that idea of you know the seeing believing thing um without being too cliche about it but um i know it 's something that i still remember actually seeing katrina presley umpire she was the first ever woman to officiate at the afl and that was up at the gaba and i was there with my dad and he pointed her out and said you know who she was and i was like whoa and it wasn 't at that point that i thought i 'm lover um it was that point i think at which i realized in the back of my mind that you know hey that 's actually possible um and at community community level look we have a lot of girls and women who are involved in umpiring um it 's still numbers wise it might be sitting around i think 10 in victoria and then it goes up to about 25 up in northern territory so depending on what state you 're in um and i can 't take total credit for that i 'm not saying that 's all me but um you know there 's definitely a wave of interest and i think we 'll probably see a little bit more you know with the growth of afl for example um we have a lot of junior players who also umpire and so that 's the message we try to get across um that you can do both you know and you know until you need to decide later on so it 's something that actually helps their footy um to be able to understand what the the umpire all of that so um there is a ground swell but it 's just i think umpiring is one of those things where there 's always that element of having to go up against negative perception um or media and it 's unfortunate if there 's a negative story um yeah it takes away from people 's understanding of all the positives so um but yeah to answer your question there is a lot of interest okay thank you we have got a few questions in the chat so i just thought i 'd read them out to you chelsea so everyone 's just um you know thanking you for your presentation and and your time and one of the questions from jess jones was what was your most memorable game you 've umpired and why ah i don 't think i could go past the afl grand final so that was yeah sydney hawthorne 2012. that i still remember being in the race waiting to step out onto the ground for that game and my heart was just thumping through my chest and it was a sense of excitement to get out there but i just wanted to enjoy the moment and um it had been a pretty crazy week so um look i can understand it was a news item so i had to do a press conference um earlier in the week um about around my appointment um there were lots of media interviews and requests and things and i was also working in my normal full-time job at the time so it was just a crazy week um and then actually on the day um prime minister gillard had requested access to the umpires rooms to congratulate me and of course that was a media opportunity so um there was a lot going on and probably that moment in the race was the first moment of quiet throughout the entire week that i 'd had and funnily enough the game felt like a bit of a breeze in comparison just meaning the prime minister on last minute notice as well you know yeah it 's sort of like um don 't change your routine for finals that was not possible that week so um yeah it i heard the prime minister wanted to meet me i was like oh that 's actually better than the game but not really um so just that the whole atmosphere of being there um i 'm not sure um jess if you 've been to a to a grand final but being there at all is awesome but sort of being in the center of the ground and then you 're giving signals and the crowds going up is pretty cool yeah it sounds amazing um we 've got one more question here um from katrina uh keen to know how many female umpires and refs there are currently in the afl and is there a development pathway for younger women yeah that 's a really good question and actually i should have made sure i had that data on hand i 'm just trying to wrap my brain um oh in the afl sorry sorry i thought you meant in community footy so they 're in the afl there are three females um so there 's sally bowd is a gold umpire over in perth um eleni gloves is field empire pathway she 's been in the afl for a couple of years and there 's myself so yes i guess you could say in terms of growth we 've tripled our numbers over 10 years or so um so that 's good uh but i would suggest there 's still a little way to go in terms of a culture that um totally encourages females to to really you know get to the top level um but the good news is there are pathways now um so as i mentioned um with eleni and the the field empire pathway it 's similar to the the player pathway so um you guys might know that david rhoden um is now a goal empire so he was a player for many years um and has now stepped in through the player pathway um into goal umpiring um so it 's similar with the female pathway now um you know the afl is realizing there needs to be a pathway and so we 're doing a lot of work at community level to try to encourage um that growth and mentoring role with the afl that involves um as it does a lenny glyphsis so um we work together to to create mentoring opportunities and um networks to to help um females in in community empowering awesome now we 've got a few more minutes and we 've got a few more questions counselor baker 's got a hand up i just didn 't know whether you wanted to i do i do thank you very much thanks eva chelsea thank you for your oh very interesting presentation i was struck by your reference to ballet and the fancy footwork and the the skills that you obviously learned as a as a young woman there and it just struck me to ask a question maybe you can talk a little bit more particularly with the um uh the women 's afl coming up are there any changes to the way people are encouraged to train or work or you know with an insight like gosh ballet skills might be really helpful for that fancy footwork around quick turns and movement you know which are being brought into uh mainstream training not 's a it 's a skill and there 's a whole team of coaches and specialists who perhaps help with some of those different talents that would enhance the game generally for for all players just wondering whether you 've observed any things over your career well i think that 's a really uh good question actually because um i mean even just talking to if you think about some of the elite male players or um talking to dave rhoden who 's part of our group now and has that elite experience as a player i think there 's a much more flexible attitude around things like pilates and um sort of doing things that maybe traditionally would seem to be you know girly activities but they realize that you know balance and strength um you know are actually really important to to their skills and actually when you started by talking about the the female game and the way in which it 's played i think there 's this really healthy and i hope it continues this way but this healthy attitude towards the female game actually being of the imagery that comes up and um some of these women they kick the ball and they 're doing the splits in the air you know there 's this flexibility um and this prowess that 's just it 's completely feminine in a lot of ways i shouldn 't say completely but there 's a femininity to it and that flexibility and the guys will probably look at that and just cringe because you know they 'd do a hamstring um if they were to attempt the same move but um i don 't know specifically i guess to get back to your question in terms of you know uh you know other clubs doing doing ballet or um things like that um i would suggest they 're much more open to cross um like cross-sporting influence so for example bringing people in from different sports experts from different fields um to consult and um act as i suppose coaches in different ways um so i think that 's something that 's going to happen more and more um at the moment if i think of what sort of tennis um but um i i don 't see why that couldn 't open up um to to include a much bigger raft of different experience because i think there 's just so much to learn from yeah that cross-cultural thing i also think of some music um sorry everyone i 'm rambling now um so i i studied music when i left school and um i was a clarinet player and a lot of what i had to do was about performing on a stage and i sort of i really think about that now and i 'm like gosh the mcg is a stage you get out there it 's body language it 's performance um yeah i i think there there 's a lot that we can do to encourage people to really tap into their own strengths thank you so much chelsea and thank you for um the opportunity to chat with you today i 've really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else has as well um we will move on now to our next speaker but we do have one more question in the to answer that one within the chat um and again if anyone else had any other questions that they wanted to ask chelsea um there 's that opportunity for chelsea to kind of respond in that chat function so thank you again so much for chatting with us today um i 'd like to now move on to our next uh speaker which is a case study from my club um i wanted to introduce megan densley who 's at australian sailing but also at frankston a yacht club um she was the first and youngest female commodore um and just wanted to have a bit of a chat about the work that they 've done in this space so welcome megan and thank you for joining us today thank you um just a heads up i have a senior dog who uh is barking at what he thinks might be moving outside sorry no drums at all that 's the uh the perks from working from home exactly yeah thank you thank you for joining us and can you first tell us a little bit about um your current and frankston frankston yacht club perfect so i 'm at australian sailing i 'm the regional manager for victoria so i 'm a state manager essentially um so i 'm fairly new to this position but i 've been involved in australian sailing for most of my career um in some way shape or form um but yes i i get to talk sailing all day which um i love um my husband thinks it 's the perfect job for me because that 's what i get to do um at frank single club i 'm the immediate past commodore so i stepped down uh two seasons ago now um to i just had reached the end of my time as commodore i was commodore there for five years and part of the building development that has occurred for it one of many commodores are part of it but i got to see the building get knocked down and rebuilt which was a very exciting time for us awesome and um just speaking about frank 's in your club could you let us know a little bit about some of in sport and women in leadership yeah so when i began uh commodore at my club uh we all which is a president uh equivalent for other clubs for those who are like watermelon commodore um we uh we 're a small club we 're about to get knocked down and culture was not very great so a lot of our members were leaving um or had left at that stage so i started off with 80 members and faced two years with no clubhouse so a big part of my role was redeveloping the culture at our club and by coincidence being a female obviously built a lot of female inclusion into our club as well so over our two years without a clubhouse we actually grew a membership to about 150 and then once we actually moved into our clubhouse we had a membership of around 240 um so we had significant growth in there we were able to achieve that 30 target of female participation so that includes our sailors on the water um as well as our sailors who or volunteers who took more of an that help our club operate and run our actual sport on the day as well so that was an exciting time i didn 't go out of my way to build female participation but i think working on the culture of our club uh frankston always had a reputation of being that boys club and a drinking club um and we had a new generation coming through um you know one of the advantage of having a temp clubhouse was we didn 't have a liquor license so that quickly changed that drinking culture very very quickly um but uh we found other ways to communicate um the sense of needing to come together and help each other during that time um i think actually changed the view for many of our female participants who did view it as a boys club and left and they started being a part of it because you needed somebody to help you toe your boat down to the beach and push it past their life saving club and we needed to come together which sort of took away a bit of that you they want to compete in this sport they have to keep up to hey i actually need help um from a man 's perspective i 'm going to go and help other people which just started people talking together and yeah and getting along well definitely so you mentioned um in terms of uh you know in increasing female participation within the club you had some sort of programs were there any other you know resources trainings um activities or events that you had um to kind of encourage females and women and girls to come along yeah so we changed um obviously going to a clubhouse we lost some capacity of our storage yard so we had to think of other ways that we could increase membership which wasn 't just purely storing large craft we introduced a stand-up paddle program which encouraged a lot of members and well we changed our membership so it wasn 't just sailing related it was watercraft and we 've changed the purpose of our club to suit them so we have a kayaking membership and a stand-up paddleboard membership where people can uh quite handy because although they 're not heavy boards they 're awkward boards lift off your roof of your car each time you just want to go for a paddle you can just take it from a shed and put it on the beach you know life is already much easier for it what i did notice though was we started encouraging our uh with our junior program we 'd tell our parents about the stand-up paddle program which a lot of moms took up and it ran alongside our junior program so mums were able to come junior program started at nine o 'clock stand up paddle board started at 9 30 which meant you could push your kids off they were safe you could say goodbye and wave to them on the shore and they could go do your own stand-up paddleboarding for an hour um have get changed have a cup of coffee and then the kids were returning back to the beach as well a large difference was that the wise partners and girlfriends of our male participants started bringing their children down and started our male participants had got young children they weren 't turning up to a club to lunchtime because they 'd been doing swimming or another activity with their kids and they were also leaving really early in the afternoon so they could be back with their families but now we had the family down at the yacht club from 9am so they were standing there they were at the canteen they were at the club much earlier um and then the families would stick around because we had you know sandcastles we have a nice facility that you can get changed you can sit on the deck so families would step along around a lot longer which in turn meant that you know we offered different volunteering positions so women also got an opportunity to be a part of you know how to start a race how to lay a course out there sitting up the tower and doing the safety observation rather than just being sitting on the beach or being placed into the canteen so it sort of changed how women fit into our club it changed how the consequences were increased membership uh increased family membership but increased bar sales because uh well canteen sales because people were staying around at our club much longer so not only did we get more membership through just general membership um we got more money because people were sticking around and and focusing our club and yeah it was really successful time um by just changing a very small detail about how we operated at junior training program in the morning yeah definitely yeah the thing is it was when you change that culture as you said you 've got different opportunities for people to come come around and you see a range of benefits within the club like you mentioned the participation membership um and as well as canteen sales so yeah that 's awesome was there any other benefits that you saw as well um amongst those ones um to the club yeah uh so definitely in our volunteering um we had more women participating um previously it was always just put your hand up if you could help um but we implemented a volunteer roster which uh our club you have to volunteer just that simple um so we uh spread our women out just like we would spread our men out and gave them opportunities to be a part of our start boats to be a part of our race officing and to be on those on water jobs that traditionally women probably hesitated to put their hands up i found that we 've got an increase of female qualified people so after they 've experienced it in a volunteer capacity they 've gone and got a qualification to become a sailing instructor to become a race officer they 've done online courses to learn how to set course uh to set a race course on the water um yeah so we 've had all sorts of uh different benefits um i definitely also had an increase during my time as commodore of uh committee members both as sub-committee and as executive members on the board um because suddenly they had an understanding and a role to play in and females just started putting their hands up it did help that you know i think you i think a female lead encouraged that um but i also had a lot of other females um start to embrace it it also wasn 't just our new members it was our existing female members and our existing uh social female members so normally a family member who may not participate that club um started to engage a lot more as well for it so a little bit of volunteered work um helped uh help show people a skill they may not have known they had yeah no for sure that 's that 's awesome um so we 've just come to the end now so we 'll have to move on but i just wanted to quickly ask as well before we do um have the has the club seen the positive changes maintained over that time as well so you mentioned that you were there two years ago have they continued seeing those positive outcomes yeah in female participation on the water and our volunteering jobs yeah we voluntarily have um there has been a change in committee um and there 's currently no females on our of change of committees they still sort of happen again you recruit your own friends and we have a male commodore um but there is still a a very good base of sub-committee female members who hopefully will step up again to be that executive role um and i 've had a large increase in young teenagers or teenagers like teenagers only 20 females who are now jumping in and putting their hands up and talking about this change so yeah i think in the next couple of years we 're going to see a boom in female leadership at our club um and definitely on our committee as well awesome thank you so much uh for your insight at the uh the frankston yacht club it 's been yeah great to hear from your experience from someone that 's actually um done some work in this space already unfortunately we won 't have time to open up to questions from the um from the audience but if um if anyone did have any specific questions for megan again you 're welcome to pop them in the chat while we and thanks for your time this morning i 'd now like to hand over from to zoe francis and can treat a nurse from wise he 'll be running through a bit of the findings from last workshop as well as um moving on with a few activities as well so welcome zoe and katrina thank you very very much eva um thank you to everyone for logging on so early on a wednesday morning and for your motivation and commitment to um creating and fostering inclusivity in sporting clubs in frankston and thanks to for chelsea and megan for your presentations it 's been very uplifting and um in the sector where we we work at wise to promote gender equality it 's really exciting to hear firsthand the stories of the progression of the work um so yeah thank you so much thank you to frankston city council for inviting us along the journey as you um move through um furthering work to promote gender equality i 'm just going to start sharing my screen um so i 'm essentially for the next five or ten minutes my you um the work from two weeks ago where we ran a session which was very similar to today but was at that community level and so we heard community voices on what people think gender inclusive clubs look like so who is women 's who is wise we are women 's health in the southeast and we partner with councils and with health promotion teams across our region um on a collective journey towards promoting gender equality preventing gender-based violence and promoting sexual and reproductive health so that 's what we do at wise and that 's why we 're so excited to be and part of this journey and the great work that you 're doing in frankston we 've already heard today about why this work is so important but just to recap that you know the power of sport is just so transformative the power of the outdoors of physical activity um obviously promotes well-being and social connection but it 's a perfect setting particularly in our australian culture and to promote gender equality and and we 've already heard first hand many um success stories in this space it 's also more important um for pretty serious reasons actually because disrespectful behaviors so kind of throw away everyday sexist comments sexist jokes inappropriate comments um they are actually proven to be the drivers of gender inequality and discrimination so there is a huge body of international evidence that i 'm sure you 're aware of but just to highlight that what we 're talking and doing here is grounded in international evidence and it 's a strong body of evidence base that we work to at women 's health east in the southeast where um yeah that that control of decision-making um and that limiting of women 's independence that has happened um going back in history are the drivers of gender inequality which does a link into family violence and abuse so there 's a absolutely you know um super important reason and to highlight just how important this work is so we 're not here today to talk about family violence and control or abuse but in having mentioned them it 's really important to note that um that could be triggering for be people in the room today who have experienced an element of that so really important if you do think that you would benefit from speaking to a professional and that you do access one of these three services so on the left there there 's the 1-800 respect number and that 's our national counselling service which is a free service in the middle there men 's line which is for men who are maybe considering getting help for their own behavior or for somebody else 's behavior um and on the right they 're safe steps which is crisis support um so moving to recap very broadly extremely broadly on what we heard at the last session the community session on when we asked people pre-session what does an inclusive club look like for you here are some of their answers um you mentioned before chelsea the principles this is what we 're talking about here the principles of the work which i think there is broadly really a lot of support for so when i kind of looked at this i saw um the values coming through heard and valued and celebrated most importantly i think also there 's some themes coming through here around um there being no barriers around as you mentioned before chelsea and that intersectional um gender is intersectional so we want to make our clubs um welcoming regardless of who we are and so whatever gender we um identify with race age sexual orientation we want it to be a place for everybody um to be active fit and to find that physical outlet so now i 'm going to hand over to katrina who 's going to talk about what we heard at the last session this looks like in practice over to you katrina thanks zoe um and hi everyone i 'm the health promotion officer at women 's health in the south east and worked with zoe in the space um so in terms of the last session that we ran we did actually ask people what type of event they would prefer in the future and um it 's not unusual to know that most people would prefer to meet in person um but sadly we did have current restrictions but it 's good to have that information so just moving along um so last um and we 'll whip through these pretty quickly i know that there are some familiar faces in the room today um but we 'll we 'll just whip through we asked um people to to use a tool called slido which we 'll use again in a moment to think about the ways that active participation on the field and off the field is encouraged for women and girls and these are some of the things that came up so in terms of on the field you can see some of those larger things um or items within the word cloud like friends and social interaction um they 're larger because they have been touched on more within the word cloud so it increases the profile and the presence of them within the word cloud so basically what it 's saying there is women and girls are wanting to feel safe and connected in the space where fitness and friendships can kind of expand and thrive which is useful and and something of those challenges for active participation on the field um these are some of the main things that came through so again it 's um you can 't see you can 't_''_2782.079 be what you can 't see so lack of role models time uniforms is there of course chelsea as you 've mentioned child care judgment working commitments so these things you know time family commitments and child care are all sort of common barriers to participation for women but some of those things can also be addressed within a club environment in terms of off the field so what we 're talking about here is volunteering roles roles and leadership also you know roles around the club that are not necessarily on the field where we 're wanting to get women and girls participation what 's come out here is that they are wanting to help out because there are never enough volunteers um and and in some respects it 's almost a case of actually being asked so women do want to feel part of the club and do see the opportunities to help off the field spaces so sometimes it is just um actually identifying and asking will will it greatly assist in getting more participation and in terms of the challenges um off the field in terms of active participation um time obviously is a big one i think for most people in today 's um world our busy our busy lives um but also coming through is that sort of loki culture boys club mentality so i think there 's a real opportunity here for clubs to explore more diverse models of um you know what what a club can look like and really encourage those those spaces um and places to be inclusive of all people and welcoming so not necessarily just a place that 's you know blokey and sort of drinking environment but also is a space where um you know families are welcome and it is more inclusive so last session we did break out into breakout rooms and we explored four areas being culture facilities leadership and community and these are some of the um the things that came out in those particular um breakout rooms that we 've slides for for everyone to see and we would encourage if there are um ideas that that people who are attending for the first time today maybe have that that they see aren 't included here or they 'd like to contribute to we 'd really welcome you to share those in the chat as well so as we go along it 'd be great if you can capture or if we can capture those so this one here is really speaking to what an inclusive club and culture looks and feels like so again it 's that um social events including everyone that friendly environment the opportunity to have representation and leadership and club communications and and make um females visible around the club and also through social media moving on to the next one so in terms of the facilities um so its physical spaces obviously need to be welcoming um and the timetabling around games and training um is something that clubs can certainly do to ensure that um there 's equality around um [Music] the timetabling for men 's and women 's games there are also which really is sort of not just about drinking and winning but brings in those elements of family as well which can help to really encourage that diversity and inclusiveness in the club and make everyone feel comfortable so here we explored leadership so how we work how we can create a gender balance and leadership roles and allow that diverse representation of voices here we started to see some some great things coming through around um recognising i guess that unconscious bias in terms of um you know something that we we all hold and are sometimes not aware of so there 's opportunities there to be able to upskill up-skill leaders within the clubs in terms of bystander training to be able to call out that sort of behaviour in a non-threatening way of course and celebrate more of an inclusive environment but also to celebrate the women behind the scenes so not just the winning aspects and to again encourage and ask in some cases just asking that simple question or identifying some of the skill sets that you have within your sporting club and where you um or become mentors or take on a role within the club is also really great bearing in mind there there are like with most people concerns around you know long-standing commitments so it 's about kind of working out for each individual what they feel comfortable with and how you can tap into their skill sets in a way that is you know works for both the club and the person and finally the community so this question we started to explore how can we make our club reflective of the community we live in so that 's about kind of broadening and strengthening and allowing um you know different people to come into the club connecting with different groups so looking at opportunities to you know connect through schools or other community groups it 's also thinking about the policy and procedure at a at a board level in terms of ensuring that we have equal representation and also offering those sort of free tryout open days less commitments coming up there as well that social membership so we do know as we explore before that um females social connection in their clubs and that that is a something that 's really important to them so it 's like how how can we create that environment within our club to get them involved so if anyone has got any additional ideas for any of those four aspects please feel free to pop those in the chat and we will certainly capture those and pick them up so what we 'd like to do now is just transition across to an activity via slido and i 'm just going to share my screen now so slido is a an interactive platform that we we used um last time for those who were here and for those who um who weren 't here er what you will need to do is um we 're already familiar with the qr code these days given that we 're using it to scan in everywhere we go if you take a picture of the screen there with your mobile device you can actually jump into the slido and we 'll ask pose a question to the group and you 'll you 'll be question um your answers will come up onto the screen anonymously so you 'll be able to see we 'll be able to actually see live live time um what people are contributing so what we 're hoping to do in this section is to really now that we 've kind of unpacked what some of those barriers um and um and and cultures are within the club um is we are looking to really just take a reflective look at what the strengths of your club are in engaging and creating inclusive spaces for women and girls and involvement on and off the field so this is really a time for you to really think about and reflect um what your club 's doing well at and and as chelsea mentioned um sometimes it 's about where to begin and it 's thinking about those little things that can make a big difference so um what i will do now is just move the pole forward so this is a word cloud similar to what we 've done before what we are looking at is both on and off your club um in engaging in creating an inclusive space so if you can just pop your ideas into your slido and they 'll start to appear up on the screen there if you haven 't managed to join yet you can see the qr codes there on the left so you can just scan that with your phone and it 'll start to pop up so it sounds like there 's already some some some great work being done at a club level already and again it 's um it is those kind of little things that make the big difference oh there 's a few more coming through here it 's very exciting watching these sliders i find there is a text limit of um 80 characters in there so i 'm sorry if um it looks like somebody 's had to have had their ideas cut off a little bit there um somebody has said they they do struggle to get women into lawn bowls despite having great facilities so do you have anything to add here i 'm just yeah no it 's great to see there 's strategic planning out there for female inclusion um and yeah just resonating on what you said there katrina around you know you can 't_''_3441.2 be what you can 't see and i think that representation on socials is super important and making sure that it is getting and the exposure it deserves so that people in the community can see it even if they 're not connected um you know directly through the club they might follow the club and say that that 's that 's great to see it 's happening what i might do now is just go to our next poll question um so here we are now flicking to think about we 're looking to reflect on um which area or areas within your club um require greater focus in terms of women and girls involvement on and off the field so based on today 's presentation uh and the ideas that you have where where do you think um your club could put its energy in terms of maybe building on some of the strengths that you have or if it 's an 've been inspired through this discussion to maybe make small changes towards creating a more inclusive environment so it may be something in the policy space it could be something in [Music] you know approaching volunteers or approaching women within the club it could be engaging outside of your club what do you feel that that you think you could do um within your club to to get that um you know that inclusive involvement of women and girls both on and off the field here so i 'll just give you a minute or so to gather your thoughts yeah and these do require a bit of thought so um you know there 's opportunities of course if if you come up with a fantastic idea after the session um please share that with um with eva or simone at frankston um in terms of the you know reach out to them and let them know as well it 'd be interesting to know katrina whether you know that what we 've got here we finally managed to get female members to nominate for the committee whether the club wanted um women and girl or women to you know step into those roles or if it was um just through kind of you know conversation at the conversational level whether it goes out formally in the communications i 'd be really interested yeah don 't yeah that 's a good point zoe and maybe um i guess um i guess i 'd say that the benefit of us asking this question as well is that um you know if there 's certain themes or certain areas that everyone that is uh within you know franks and clubs are currently experiencing it 's an area that we might be able to focus and provide more support on so yeah it 's really it would be really good to hear your thoughts on what um what area you think your club may require more support in and we can hopefully provide some more um more focus in that area moving forward we 'll do another activity as well either just a quick um ranking at towards the end of the presentation shortly where people will have the opportunity to to rank supporting role in to improve that gender equity within their club so that 's great we 've got a few here um playing men 's and women 's domes and say okay with the barrier development pathways so we 'll thank you for your participation in these we 'll definitely keep these um these thoughts as we go through but i 'm going to throw back to eva now um she is going to give you a bit of a quick overview of what 's already out there in terms of resources yes so i 'm hoping i 'm sharing my strength and i 'm unmuted now so basically as i was saying um i guess the next steps and what we look what we 're looking to do here is is developing a bit of an audit tool that will assist clubs um you know currently rank where they 're where they 're at and moving forward in what steps they can take as well um just in terms of you know that initial scope in phase um to see what 's currently out there there is quite a space um uh you know from vic sports vic health and other council regions as well um the example that i 've got here on the screen was a gender equity self-assessment tool that was developed by yarrow rangers council inspiro and each in 2018 and it had been de uh implemented sorry by by a range of councils in that region as well so there is some great um tools that already exist out there i guess what we we 're looking to do is not necessarily reinvent the will but um you know have a chat to a few of these people that have developed these existing tools to you know hear from their learnings of what what aspects of it worked well and what um you know what we can uh improve on within our localized version so when we had a look at uh the existing tools that were already out there we we 'd seen quite a few you know common themes in terms of areas of clubs that could um could be uh improved or worked on in in terms of women and girls this this tool here on screen again as i mentioned was the yara rangers council 's version um and in specific areas that we 've kind of come across uh in terms of all the tools were gener generally they 'd kind of begin by by having a look at um you know the demographic breakdowns across different areas of the clubs um and then looked into aspects such as leadership club culture membership and engagement um you know physical and visual environments such as the facilities as this section here on on screen shows that the volunteers and employment and employees sorry um policies and practices and a bit of an online presence as well so basically in this tool um as an example what i kind of wanted to pull out was one one version so uh you know the the area of the topic area here was uh volunteers and employees what it what it then does was look at you know the reasons why having you know a quality across that is important and why it 's beneficial but down here it 's got some statements could be doing in that space so as i 'll read one as an example so our club aims to increase the gender balance in all club roles um what then we would kind of look to do is is together with the committee um is to have a look at you know at the tool at the at the statements um together and rank where you 're currently at and it 's not to kind of you know place one club above another it 's it 's more so for your own learning and you know your own improvements so you know we do this well this needs more work we don 't currently do this or you know it 's not necessarily relevant to your club um once you know once you all work together to have a look um at all the you know the statements across all the areas underneath it 's got um you know actions as you know what what your club could potentially potentially be doing in that specific area to improve and i guess um you know if your club 's not kind of your your starting point on how you can improve i guess what we 're looking to do as well is create a localized version of um of of the tools that we found um you know hear from you in in terms of what areas might need more work but then also potentially provide some resources so for example there might be you know existing templates that might assist with policies so along with our audit tool and action um you know action plan template we 'd aim to kind of pull it together in a big resource that has you know specific resources that might assist your club moving forward as well so um i guess that was a little bit of an overview of that one i 'll quickly what i 'll do as well is i will share um in the in the chat function there 's actually uh the links i can profile the links there 's this is the one for um the one that i was just showing there so i 'll pop them in the link so if anyone wants to you they 've got club information you know leadership and then specific statements that your club can have a look at and different areas that you could potentially improve on and then actions as well so there 's that one there um which is a little bit more detailed and if your club just wanted to have a um a bit of a starting point there 's a simple one pager or two pager from big health as well um there might be a bit of a um a bit of a starting point that 's a bit simpler as well whilst we 're creating our own tools so just thought i 'd kind of show you what 's what 's out there at the moment and i 'd like to throw back to why so we 'll ask a few more questions before we wrap up for the session um yeah thank you thanks ava um the other thing i just wanted to mention was i um frankston from what i understand are also looking at um doing a localized video um around profiling some of the clubs and too so do you want to speak quickly about that or yeah more than happy to so basically um what we 're looking to do as well is create a bit of a video which i think zoe just put into the chat um uh we 're looking to kind of showcase some of the clubs that are you know doing well in this space already um you know hear from some committees whether it 's you know a coaching staff or a player is to the importance and the benefits of being welcoming and inclusive and then kind of use that to showcase and more broadly promote um you know work that 's already been done by some but then encourage others to continue in this space so over the next um you know month or so i 've been in contact with a few sporting clubs that are happy to be um to participate and be filmed um you know obviously coverts put a put a bit of a halt in terms of uh filming was supposed to go out and film last week so hopefully once um to um get that back on the way and um yeah be able to share that with you guys shortly as well great thanks eva so as i mentioned we 'll just quickly run [Music] two more quick questions one 's just a ranking poll so you won 't have to think too much they 've we 've just got some options on the screen um but a really useful way to gather some information around the way in which um clubs can see council continuing to support this work um within the region so as you can see here it 's looking at what role do you see council complaints supporting your club to improve gender equity and this will help to really kind of drive that supported at a local level from council so what you do what you can do here is just click on your top three options i think you 're allowed to pick [Music] um so it looks here it looks like we 've got seminars and training sessions capacity building presenting case studies from other clubs so like um we did today with hear from megan in terms of what they 've done there but um it 's always good to um to share ideas within the sporting club community and providing clubs with templates so policy documents that could be the audit tool as well like eva has just actually the audit tool here is not i can see that down the bottom here so providing clubs with audit tools and checklists similar to the one shown okay so i 'll give you just um a few more seconds to finish voting if anyone else is still voting there or again if you 've got um issues with slido you 're welcome to just pop it into the chat function and send it either directly to one of us or or pop it in there and we can include that in this data okay thank you that 's really um really useful information so it 's moving again um okay so so just finally um the the last question here um before we uh we 're getting close to wrapping um the event because we 're finishing up at 9 30. but if there is other support that might assist your club to improve gender equity so um i guess this is kind of throwing the neck um broad and wide um in terms of you know if you had a wish list and a magic wand um what would you what would you pop in here um to help improve gender equity within your club um child minding for young moms supporting single moms funding to support upgrading facilities changing rooms adding a playground yeah it 's really interesting that they too came through very strongly in the first session didn 't it katrina the um the child care you know but that is certainly barrier yeah and that may even be for um you know it may even be for for all parents in fact so not necessarily just mums but um for for dads that uh you know primary carers of their children as well they um may also want opportunities to participate in sport and have that support available to them as well yeah absolutely yeah it 's interesting about their membership fees i think you know when i wonder you know how much opportunity there is there for organizations to sponsor um women in sport and whether that is a rebate or membership fees or potentially paying um you know women and girls for professional sport it 's a really interesting concept yeah yeah certainly probably happening to some degree that i 'm not aware of okay so we might leave that pole there um just so we 've got a little bit of time at the end so what i might do now is i 'm going to jump off and thank you all for your time and contributions today um as i said we have kind of made you think and reflect and i will throw back to both eva and simone just to wrap up and maybe answer some of the questions about where to from here thanks everyone thanks thanks katrina thanks zoe um and thank you everyone for being here today we really appreciate your time we know it 's very early in the morning um uh you could have worn your jammies if you kept the camera off it would have um but um but we we thank you for taking the time to be here today um and being um being the change makers in our community we think it 's that 's really great um we know that australian sports and physical activity providers they need people like yourselves we 're going to work on building sports clubs that are inclusive and a welcoming environment for women and girls who become central to the fabric of the club alongside the men in the club as well we want to see that positive club transformation um from here we will be looking at using this information and analyzing it um as even suggested there are a range of tools there are a range of programs that exist um what we want to do is we want to make sure that what we put together um a package of of support with support tools that um that are specific to our local um frankston community and are relevant to the needs of our community as well so that 's what this sort of process is about so from here we 'll and then coming back to you um to refine that um to test it to see if it is useful and um and hopefully using the clubs who are present today um to charge forward lead the way and encourage the clubs who aren 't here today to also come on board as part of that process [Music] _"

    "text": "[Music] hello my name is Claire and I 'm an artist I work full time as an artist actually and so I 'm very lucky I get to work in my studio in my garden and I have ducks that come into my studio and I have a three-legged hound dog that helps me I have a cockatoo that sits on my shoulder and wrecks my artwork she 's a naughty bird and I have another parrot even and so I 've been teaching children and adults for many years and I 've been invited to show you all how to make sweeping puppets and I 've had so much fun making these flippin puppets I 've actually not been able to stop once I started playing it 's been so much fun and so I have so many ideas for you all to be able to make your own puppets at home and you don 't even need many materials sometimes you can just have a look around what you what you have at home you might have some old boxes from the pantry and if you 've got out and open up the box and then you 've got cardboard ready to go you might have some old cardboard boxes you 're not just an old box around and I think boxes are so so useful for artists like yourself to use all the time I love cutting up bits of box and then you 've got you 've got materials that you can use to make to make things you can make you know millions of things with boxes so I think what will what I 'm going to imagine is at home you might not have a studio full of art things because I 'm lucky I do but if you don 't let 's all imagine that you 've all got a pen in your house most people can find a pen or a pencil and I wanted to show you all all the different things you can do with a pen this lip puppet here split pin puppet its mouth opens and shuts its legs can move that everything on this puppet I did with just a black biro just to pop by roy you could then go up but i 've got colored textures or i 've got pencils or I 've got watercolors but at the moment I 'm gonna assume that everyone 's got a biro pen or pencil there 's a I 've done a sheet here of various marks that you can make that I wanted to show you some different marks that you might want to make so if we imagine I 'm going to imagine that this is going to be one leg on my puppet and so I 'll do a few of these to show you different types of marks that you could make we 've got four legs one I 'm going to make as a hairy leg so here anyone can do his they 're just doing that look I don 't even need to look what I 'm doing here 's I can just look around the room while I 'm doing hairs and you 'll start to build up that you might want to have long hair if you want to have long hair on your on your creature or it one you could do is I call it knitting with a pen when I 'm knitting with a pen I 'm making lines lines of a sort of texture and I 'm just going loopy loopy loopy loopy ran around around and then don 't do another line of that just underneath the last one and you can build up you can build up really lovely textures if I want to make it darker on the sides and down a little bit with my Kenyan eating machine and see instead of going straight across if I did a line that was straight across it would make it look flat but because I 'm doing a little bit of an arc like it eat starting and going and coming up again it makes it look a little bit rounder so that 's our knitting another one I want to show you is called hatching and cross-hatching and a lot of the old painters and drawers used to use this a lot but it 's a really easy technique to shade with a pen and so hatching is when you just go edges a little bit here doesn 't matter if you go out of the lines either for making your sleeping puppets because we 're going to be cutting out these shapes later and I 'll go in this direction say I want the top of the leg really dark I 'll go across this way then I can go in another direction so that 's hatching and cross-hatching we 've done our knitting we 've done our hairy little little lines and another one might be just wild coloring in so if you color in with a texture or a pencil you might go up and down up and down there with a pen you might get bored but you can get beautiful lines just from being busy and going in every every different direction doesn 't matter if you 're neat or not I love scribbling these are our four types of pen marks that we 're going to design out our first puppet with now we 're going to plan our puppet now there are so many possibilities for your puppets there you might want to make animals might want to make your pets you might want to make your parents who knows what you want to make this one is just a made-up and made-up animal kind of monstery thing it can move around what you what you want to think about is that or any part that you want to move you have to draw as a separate piece so I 've drawn the mouth separate I 've drawn the ears separate the tail separate for this cat that I was making I just did a very simple body a face or a head that went on the body and then I 've got some paws and legs that can go on the cat later we 'll put this cat together later but it 's a very simple shape okay so now is the the part where we we 've got our four legs I 'm going to make up a body so I think I might make this body like a big roundish kind of it 's almost like a jelly bean shape and then the head so I have to think about what sort 'm gonna make mine just have a nice big round face this is where my split pin will go later when it joins on to the puppet and I 'm going to do also a tail I think a tail is nice this one 's going to have a tail this is where or join to the body with the split pin this tail is going to curl like this so it will go about here for a tail okay for my animal I also would like it to have horns so it 's a bit more monstery now I won 't really fit one here I could just do a little one here just a small horn and this one 's going to have wide apart eyes like this it 's going to have a big smile and I think a really big nose would be good so I 'm going to draw a big nose like this the nose can become eyebrows every day so I 'm going to start with the eyebrows can be some of my fuzzy coloring in I will do some inside these ears my hatching and then some of it all do cross hatching hatching cross-hatching I might make the Chiti the face a little bit hairy so I 'll give it some hair and some I think some big teeth that look out it still looks doesn 't look too scary because he 's happy this is gonna be a bit of a hairy guy big happy smile and messy teeth okay for his tail I 'm going to want to have lots of hair so you you will remember how to do the hair you might want to do long hair which would be longer lines I might do scales on the body like he 's kind of a part that 's a bit fishy almost and I could spend some time coloring in each of these different colors and things scales are beautiful when you color them in so I 've got all of my parts here I 'm going to start cutting them out now I 'm going to use just just some scissors for this and I 'm going to cut around each of my pieces sometimes I of all the shapes to get rid of all the extra paper that 's on the sides [Music] now I 'll cut out my fear for you sometimes I go over the lines so around the horns around with okay so I 've got everything cut out except for the tail cut out the tail hey so I 've got all my pieces now I 'm gonna lay them out have a look at what they might look like there 's the monster head one leg two leg three league ball leg and a tail and so I might want to have him like this I might then try what would happen if you look like here he was standing up this way if you with some legs and arms and a head that did this his tail might be peeling up over here I might prefer that for my monster so I can try all different all different ways that I might like it I might want to try the body up the other way I might wanna have the body over his face okay so this this is 'll show you how to put the split pin in I get some thick cardboard to go underneath my puppet for when I push the I push a blade through this is definitely something that you need to get a grown-up to help you with if you 're a grown-up you 're allowed to do it carefully so what we want to do is get a Stanley knife and if your family don 't have a Stanley knife you 're a grown-up might be able to use scissors and push the scissors through I use a Stanley knife because I have one but you could so I do a small slit like this I get my my split pin I pop it through the hole and then on the back I split pin and so that is how a split pin will hold and then it will move so then the next he 's armed I 'm going to put on this side I 'm going to do a small incision like this I 'm going to get my pin pop it through both layers turn over and let the our first little monster monster II split pin puppet made with the Bairro pin like a black and a blue pin and just some old paper here 's another one that I put together earlier you 'll see it 's a really simple shape for the body I 've got a little face on there that can move and I 've been drawing kind of like cat 's paws I will show you that I 've been playing with how how this cat might go together but it 's the same thing even with the thick cardboard you will need to push your pin through there 's so much thicker than the than the paper we 've been using but it will work just as well here it comes through the other side and then I split the pin like this so you 'll be able to you might choose to have something that only has one split pin it might be an animal and just its head moves or just one arm moves it 's up to you you might be like me and you can 't stop making then I 'll pop on the legs you can always you can always come back to your puppet once you 've put it together this one this legs gonna have trouble fitting on I could either put it behind or I could cut it I could cut it a bit thinner I think with this one I 'm just gonna put the leg behind it doesn 't bother me if it 's behind and then I might come back to this cat and keep drawing it 's its paws I might just have some paws on its feet like this or I might even use my marker I 've got some different markers and I might want to put some maybe some stripes on my cat so it might be stripy cat [Music] so here we go we 've got a stripey spotty cat whose face moves tips its head and it 's just made out of cardboard how cool is that [Music] [Music] you _"

    "text": "[Music] it 's a pleasure to be here to talk about council 's work ready program which was created in direct response to the youth unemployment issue in frankston a work ready um program has a number of different components including a work experience program for year 9 students practical student placements apprenticeships and traineeships school-based apprenticeships and a workplace learning program facilitated by the frankston mornington peninsula local learning and employment network part of the traineeship component of the program council resolved to target vulnerable and at risk young people to give them the valuable work ready skills coaching and mentoring and the confidence to take the next steps into their employment futures as coordinator of the program it 's been an absolute pleasure to see the trainees develop throughout the year and the positive contributions that they 've made both to their teams and the organisation our councillors too have been really passionate and supportive of the program and are really keen to see it succeed and grow unfortunately since march many of the elements of the program have been severely impacted by the covert restrictions so we next year i was involved with a employment service called wise employment they 're specific for people with disabilities and trying to get them to find work when perhaps they have struggled going straight into the workplace especially with me i have quite a few anxiety and mental issues that i 've struggled with especially coming out of high school so i kind of missed that time when people my age were getting experience which is what every workplace really needs more than your education it didn 't matter really how educated i was it was they wanted experience so they were really helping to bridge that gap of talking to people and going yes you know vouching for me and saying that i can i am capable of what i was doing and finding those opportunities and that 's when they came to me and told me about the work ready program and asked if i was interested and i said of course so i was at school and i wasn 't really enjoying my time in school to be unsure what i wanted to do throughout school and came to the decision that it wasn 't for me so i left school part way through year 11 and really had no direction so i started attending headspace which was which was really good they were some good help and but i really weren 't sure what i should do but they suggested um attending brotherhood of st lawrence so i start i was a bit iffy about that to start off with but i started attending brotherhood and it was really good i really enjoyed my time there everyone was lovely all the trainers were great people uh and i was there for about four or five weeks just attending weekly sessions when this opportunity came up at frankston city council and i applied for it um and i got an interview and luckily i got the job when i graduated high school i spent a year where i deferred the study that i was looking to go into to find some work experience and at the end of that year it came to a point where there was no there wasn 't enough students to fill that the ones that were presented were the ones i was looking before so i fell back into looking for work rather than looking to study again and i was working in fast food kitchens for a little while at the start of last year i decided i wanted to get out of the kitchen and into a customer service oriented role with the intention of going into the retail specifically initially and over time i developed a bit more of a broader spectrum of where i 'd like to go and what i like to do for work and i got into contact with wise employment and they set me up with a few interviews that went okay and didn 't get any results from and later in that year i came into contact with diet from council and we had an interview and i 've been under die energized coordination since october of last year so i started off working with the transition to work team with brotherhood of st lawrence and i was working with them for a few days just getting my resume all sorted trying to given the chance program advertised that they were doing traineeships through frankston city council and once i 've seen that i did everything i could to apply for the role so i usually do immunization i usually go out to school and infant sessions and help with the admin team but lately during covert i 've had to learn to do it all in the office instead of going out to the session which is different i 've also been helping out with the direct care worker rosters as we do now at the art center as well well initially my role was to help with the learning development the implementation of my learning and the courses that were going on there so there was a lot of work setting up and sitting down training organizing cantering and promoting their compliance course that we implemented as well as the supplementary courses that we 've got as well it was really wonderful for me that community safety it 's sort of like this umbrella term so it wasn 't just i got to learn one little thing and that was it a lot and then in building and then in the business support and i got to shadow some of the coordinators and it was really wonderful each day i was learning something different my title is strategic plan planning training uh so basically i just help out with the strategic planning team that 's what i 've been doing for the past 11 months now um so yeah just whatever project or tasks or anything they need help with i just just help out there um and lately in the past kind of four or five months i 've been helping out um other teams and within the department which i really enjoy that learning um all aspects of planning it 's really interesting something i didn 't have a clue about 12 months ago but now i feel like i 've got i 've got a big knowledge of planning and how it 's done and it 's really interesting yeah well the breadth of knowledge that i 've achieved and experienced within the last 11 months has been amazing and especially given the circumstances that we find ourselves expecting to endure throughout the course of the traineeship as no one was really expecting this to come to what has been um it 's really interesting because there 's been a lot of things that i wasn 't expecting to learn that i have learned and a lot of stuff taught i knew that i was going to learn that i learned a lot more of and am a lot more interested in than i first thought i would be when i started the traineeship but i think uh it 's definitely taught me how to uh how to act and how to dress and how to speak professionally it 's definitely uh enhanced all other skills i 've already had and um yeah everyone 's everyone 's been great i 've had a couple mentors and everyone 's really helpful everyone 's always looking to help me and help build my skills so it 's really

constructive and substantive like employment we will also be focusing in on ex-offenders appropriate ex-offenders to give them that second chance that is what reconciliation is and we will be we are

'm originally from shepparton area that 's where i am today so i just like to acknowledge my elders past and present also i like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands where i am today which is the bangarranga yordiota people and i 'm just going to talk a little bit today about reconciliation and what that means to me as an aboriginal man reconciliation i think means walking together as different cultures and you know different people from different backgrounds being willing to and open to learn about each other 's cultures about each other 's customs and traditions we celebrate different about that and also a big thing for aboriginal people is acknowledgement so being acknowledged of the of the you know long-standing culture that 's been here for thousands of years um and and being recognized for that we something that we want to educate the wider community more about and teach you more about our culture about our customs and some of our traditions we believe that if you live here in australia you live off the land or you live off these waterways that you are part of our culture and we share our culture so we are accepting and we want to invite people into that and so that 's what reconciliation means to me hello everyone my name is carla louch i 'm a proud gunji jamara carey we 're wrong bonjour lung woman born and raised on the mornington peninsula i 'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which i was born and where i stand today the land of the banurong people i 'd also like to pay my respects to all elders past present and a nation it 's about respect respecting each other 's cultures and traditions and more importantly it 's about acknowledging the past and recognizing our history as a whole not just parts of it i believe in order to move forward together uh education is crucial our people are often perceived in a negative light particularly through the mainstream media and i think education is so important not just for the non-indigenous community but for the indigenous community as well to share the beauty of aboriginal culture growing up with fair skin my aboriginality was questioned at times and still is today so i 'd also like to create awareness on what it means to be aboriginal and that the color of your skin doesn 't define who you are as a person so let 's come together and embrace each other 's differences and move forward into the future as one thank you hello everyone i 'm shaden i 'm a proud yorthy older man from shepparton i was born in shepherd and raised in the western suburbs first of all i just want to acknowledge the land that custodians of these lands and waters i want to talk about reconciliation what it means to me and a lot of other black fellas first of all i feel like it 's about recognizing the original custodians to this land of all australian nations from all countries of australia and all all different types of tribes it 's about recognizing um our people and our culture and what 's happened most importantly and acknowledging it and acknowledging the strength that we 've got that holds us connected to this land still today that goes back 60 thousand years you know like you 've got to look at the natural sources that that we still live off today which is grandfather sun mother earth and mother nature and these are the things that cost nothing that give us a spiritual experience and a spiritual spiritual growth an internal peace of mind um i just want to acknowledge all elders and all people that have passed before me as well and that have walked this land for 60 thousands of years and it 's not about separating us as aboriginal people or we are and what we stand for because without us you can 't_''_442.56 be connected to australian [Music] land and um it 's about like us coming together today and we 're not trying to separate ourselves or restrict ourselves from from non-indigenous people we need you as much as you need us today so let 's come together and acknowledge and recognize the original custard in this land and come together as one and support each other and move forward together in a positive direction so to me reconciliation is as a non-indigenous person um who grew up in the 60s it 's very much about acknowledging the injustices that 's happened to indigenous people and me as a non-indigenous person respecting and working with indigenous people side by side to make this a better a better land to live in and a better country to live in yeah to me it 's about recognising the past the good the bad the ugly uh and striving towards a more equitable future where more indigenous voices are heard and we can work a lot more collaboratively for a better future has gone on in the past and what can be done better in the future to have a more inclusive and progressive society for aboriginal people to be given the same opportunities as non-indigenous people in australia i think that we 've gotten to a point where there 's been no truth-telling and recognition of how advanced aboriginal people were historically before colonialization and we could move forward as a nation and has a full world perspective changing climate change if we were to implement more of the aboriginal methods of farming science and everything from the past and work towards that as a future and our government needs to step up and actually make some change and empower aboriginal people to make choices and direction of their own life in their own hands through echoes thank you reconciliation to me is for the non-indigenous people and indigenous people of australia coming together as one closing that gap connecting the culture learning about and respecting each other 's cultures reconciliation to me means truth-telling um acknowledging the past and what our ancestors have gone through but also celebrating our beautiful chance to get together with the entire of australia whether you 're aboriginal torres strait islander brown black whatever color you are what a racist ethnicity it 's a chance for us to all come together i guess hopefully learn about some of the history of australia not only the last 300 years but the last 40 000 years but particularly a chance to talk about the effects of colonization and what how that has impacted our aboriginal families and continues to impact our aboriginal families to today so i like to think of this chance to unify but also educate um on australia 's history and a chance for us to come together and kind of bond over that and hopefully educate some people um and empower other people but at the end of the day come together and kind of celebrate where we are today and where we have to get rid of the future and how to get there but i think the day brings people together and there 's also a chance to celebrate the future but reflect on the past hi my name is shirley west queensland i acknowledge the traditional owners of this land on which we stand i acknowledge all elders past present and emerging reconciliation week what it means to me is everyone acknowledging our past and that 's as aboriginal people the first nation people of this land acknowledging the transgenerational trauma that it 's had on our community and it 's about everyone working together that 's non-indigenous alongside of indigenous with ensuring that aboriginal people lead the way in regards to aboriginal self-determination and allowing for healing amongst our communities it 's about everyone making a stronger and healthier place not only for aboriginal community but for non-indigenous too but with aboriginal community leading the way hi everybody my name is lionel louch i 'm a good ninja mara kurorang banjalang man here to talk to you today about reconciliation what it means to me reconciliation to me is all about getting together different cultures different religions different peoples coming together sharing our cultures and our our beliefs our food and our customs so um here in australia we 're the indigenous people that are leading the way and other way but it 's us that are leading the way and um we 're trying to bring and invite everybody into our culture introduce people into our culture what i do is educate people about indigenous culture aboriginal culture so i take walks i take people through walks from the country and i show you that country through my eyes through the eyes of an indigenous person i show you that everything has a meaning and everything has a purpose i teach you about bush tucker and i 'll teach you about medicine about geology and about healing grandfather son mother earth and all the positive energies i teach you all about that and i opened people 's eyes up to it generally when i do a walk with a group of people after that walk um their eyes are completely open and i know after that walk that those people become my allies and they open their eyes up to reconciliation and they think a lot more they talk a lot more after my walks i notice people get together and have more conversations instead of sort of up forth at their meetings at their tables with their family groups everybody 's talking about it because they 're actually seeing this world through our eyes so that 's my that 's my in reconciliation my name is grant lee i 'm a willy willy durable man from southeast and central queensland i 'm here to talk about reconciliation and what it means to me i work for francis city council as a reconciliation project manager so reconciliation is very important to me reconciliation theme this year is more than a word and it is it is more than word it 's about reconciling between the different cultures in within australia but in particular how aboriginal people and taurus island people can be reconciled with the past and what 's happened in the past but moved towards a better future and that 's a future we can do together by working together and that 's what to me is about reconciliation it 's how we work as one as a one culture as a one nation hey past i can still feel the heartbeat clumps echoes the pulse of speech dictions of ambition must believe hey future keep a solid vision on me native lingo history is skin deep my only sin was the color of my skin so imma sin till pride emancipate mental slavery and they said we will fail in time showed them

    "text": "[Music] i enjoy being able to play with a full girls team instead of sharing the field with boys here at council we believe that everyone should be able to participate in sport and physical activity in a welcoming and inclusive way and should be treated with respect and dignity free from discrimination we know that across victoria most women and girls do not do enough physical activity to benefit their health and well-being that is also the case here in frankston city it is also known that women and girls are less likely to participate in organized sports as they are more commonly experienced in multiple different types of barriers moving forward we are aiming to work with our local sporting clubs to create gender inclusive environments and welcoming clubs for all this in turn will lead to an increase in participation from players through to volunteers staff leadership roles and officials [Music] here at frankston we believe inclusion is our responsibility as a good community organisation it provides opportunities for people to make a difference in the community bringing all these young girls in has been fantastic brings as well which um most clubs always struggle to get volunteers in so the more families we get involved the more people that are helping out and just makes it from a broader community based environment really my daughter was one that actually made me form a woman 's side and get a woman 's side because she plays to under 12s and then under 12 's over you can 't play with the boys anymore so we had nowhere to go apart from doing nothing and i wasn 't not having that so that 's where i went down and reached out and started pushing numbers and i started off with going to a school one day tournament and i took seven girls down there they played and then i pretty much came back with 30 years after that it comes down to visibility and you can 't sound so cliche but you really cannot be what you can 't see so in terms of having role models available and visible for younger players both boys and girls of all genders that 's the most critical thing i think girls coming through now and filtering through the sandy club and so many girls now have taken on those leadership roles and have really led the way for years to come as a female coach it 's easier for the girls to connect with me and ultimately that makes them feel more comfortable because they can come and talk to me about things that they might not be able to do with a guy trying to draw women and boys together so there 's no difference you know they do all it 's one running harder to tackle is the tackling just as hard as the boys and the boys have more respect for the girls that you know they 're doing what they 're doing the very first step that i would recommend to any club is to make sure that you have a board that is supportive of inclusion and not only supportive of it but can quantitatively measure the improvement in inclusion particularly involving women as seen by our local clubs and others working in this space it is common that inclusive clubs experience a range of itself therefore we are aiming to assist clubs provide welcoming environments so that they can be happy healthy and thriving [Music] _"

    "text": "[Music] g 'day i 'm graeme lorimer i 'm an environmental scientist and i 'm in my element here in a woodland with mount dandenong in the background there and i 've spent a lot of my career looking after native flora and fauna and i put forward this as the first of a series of videos on how to manage environmentally harmful plants in natural and semi-natural ecosystems but first i need to provide some definitions i call a plant indigenous if it 's growing in its natural range and in the natural sort of habitat most of the plants in this woodland are indigenous here but this wonga vine i 'd say is not that 's because uh it belongs in a wet forest or a mountain ash forest or a rainforest and prior to 25 years ago it didn 't occur any closer to this than about two kilometers away in the dandenong ranges so i would call this not an indigenous plant now you can call a plant like this a weed if you like a wheat is just a subjective term that means that you be but for the purposes of managing a natural or semi-natural area we need a more objective definition of a particular sort of weed we call them environmental weeds here 's my carefully crafted definition of environmental weed it 's a plant that is displacing indigenous flora and fauna except if that plant is displacing flora and fauna as part of a natural cycle this definition excludes any non-indigenous plant that is not displacing indigenous flora and fauna for example annuals confined to the edges of paths those plants are not environmental problems as i 'll explain later environmental weeds do include any population of an indigenous species that has become so out of ecological balance that it is displacing other indigenous plants or animals examples from forests to the east of melbourne include unnaturally dense regrowth of yarra bergen or weeping grass or this small leaf clematis clematis decipions i 'd call this wonga vine an environmental weed because its foliage is so dense that it 's blocking photosynthesis to the plants underneath and some of the plants around here actually climbing up other plants to such an extent underneath the habitat for lizards is being impaired so it 's having those negative impacts on the indigenous flora and fauna even in a nearby garden a wonga vine can be an environmental weed because its wind blown seeds can blow into this woodland and displace indigenous plants sweet petosman is a lovely plant in a garden what 's happened here is that around 30 years ago this fence was put in at that stage the vegetation was the same on each side on this side volunteers have continually removed the sweet potosporums and on this side the owners of the private land have left it as they are the result is that as you can see there 's a much different understory on this side of the fence compared with the other side of the fence and the whole structure of the vegetation is different there have a look underneath the sweet potasspirams the petospherums compete strongly against indigenous plants for sunlight soil moisture and nutrients i 've watched the indigenous ground cover slowly die out the pitospherums are therefore acting as environmental weeds here a primary goal that to eliminate or minimise the non-indigenous plants a main reason for that is that the site of non-indigenous plants offends our idea of what a natural area should look like but what if those non-indigenous plants are of very little environmental consequence at all like the annual weeds along the edge of the path here and what if trying to control them is really just a very temporary thing and takes away resources from what could be doing greater environmental benefit and what if the act of trying to get rid of these non-indigenous plants actually causes harm to the indigenous flora of fauna such as the locally rare helmet orchids that used to occur along here until they were accidentally sprayed with herbicide what about other environmental weeds that have some redeeming qualities like providing habitat for fauna whose natural habitat has been severely depleted in these cases controlling the non-indigenous plants comes with a cost and can be harmful to the indigenous flora conversely sometimes doing things to advantage the indigenous flora and fauna also encourages environmental weeds or minor ways like these on the edge of the about every 20 years or so in order to benefit the rare plants that occur here particularly orchids and i do that even knowing that that same act of encouraging the orchids will also encourage annual weeds like flea bones and south thistles to germinate in the wake of the fire so there 's no one-to-one correspondence between removing non-indigenous plants and encouraging native flora and fauna it 's all too easy to think that by making an area look more natural by removing non-indigenous plants we actually make the area more natural and more ecologically healthy even if we 're not noticing that the penalty for doing that is sometimes to cause harm to the indigenous flora and fauna or to divert resources that should be placed elsewhere or that may be very temporary and not really give us any significant benefits i would encourage you instead to think about not just the way things look and that there are non-indigenous plants present but rather look for the more fundamental and challenging task of really favoring the indigenous flora and fauna and in order to do that you 'll and competition native vegetation is a hotbed of competition periodically i organize a fire in this area in order to stimulate regeneration it shifts the competition according to different species for a couple of years maybe three years after a burn a particular group of species are favored such as these fireweeds that came up copiously in last year 's burn there are also copious seedlings down at ground level almost all victorian ecosystems other than rainforests need those cycles and in between those cycles there 's a range of species that rely on sporadic small amounts of disturbance that might come about from a bandicoot or an echidna digging scratching the ground and stimulating germination of species the trouble is that humans have introduced all kinds of plants and animals and fungi and so when disturbance occurs now it 's just as likely that you 'll be encouraging those introduced species rather than the indigenous species this has major implications for management of natural and semi-natural areas when there 's disturbance which might even be after you 've been doing weed control you can expect introduced species not just an ecological principle that disturbance is the way that environmental weeds become established in natural and semi-natural environments i 'll give credit to the great australian ecologist marilyn fox for pioneering that and for further reading i recommend the reference below now just because disturbance is the way that environmental weeds become established in natural systems doesn 't mean that they 're all worth worrying about for example after the fire here up came a whole lot of fleabanes in the genus origiron and south thistles species like that only persist for two or three years before they disappear unless there is ongoing disturbance so again you need to consider the disturbance when you 're thinking about how to manage environmental weeds that brings me to the ecological concept of a spectrum of species between opportunists on the one hand and competitors on the other opportunists are the species that establish very rapidly when there is a newly available vacant ecological niche and the competitors are the ones that take a lot longer to establish following the creation of a newly vacant ecological niche and there is a spectrum of time after an event like the fire that occurred here initially there is a flourishing of the opportunistic species particularly daisies like the flea bones i just mentioned as well as the fireweeds i showed you but they only last for a couple of years and rapidly they become out-competed by species that are slower to get started but eventually out-compete the opportunists because they 're often larger and so they capture more sunlight which means they can make better use of the nutrients and moisture in the soil so we 've got this spectrum between the opportunists and the competitors and how you deal with those as environmental weeds really matters opportunists we know are reliant on that vacant ecological niche being created so if it 's continually being created such as by feet on the edge of the path next to me you will always have the opportunistic species and trying to get rid of them is fruitless unless you deal with the underlying cause of that disturbance on the other hand if you were able to stop the disturbance such as by closing off a path here accord in a long undisturbed environment opportunistic species disappear over time but on the edge of the path the unrelenting disturbance of foot traffic creates conditions that are always conducive to the opportunistic species and that includes things like flat weeds as in the case of this cud weed and reward down here and a range of grass species that are introduced and opportunistic on the edge of the path here and so these species are going to persist here indefinitely as long as there is foot traffic creating the disturbance you might also notice that there is a maroon hood orchid just here because it turns out that a lot of orchid species are also somewhat opportunistic and that 's the problem with trying to do too much control of opportunistic species as well as getting rid of the introduced ones it 's quite likely you 're going to inadvertently destroy something like an orchid on the edge of the path this issue of the relationship between disturbance and the establishment of environmental weeds is of particular importance for flood plains and stream channels wetlands and shorelines because those 't abate i think you can see it 's quite important to be able to tell whether a species is more on the opportunistic end of the spectrum here are three ways that i suggest you can get an idea of that the first one is to check the root system because many opportunistic species have got very shallow root systems very wispy root systems so when you gently pull them up as you can see here there 's very little to it the second test is to see whether those species are clustered in the more disturbed parts of the environment such as along the edges of the paths and if they don 't seem to be spreading beyond that particular part of the environment it 's likely to be an opportunistic species and probably not of too much concern the third test is to watch how quickly the plant grows from a seedling to reproductive maturity now the concept of a spectrum between opportunists and competitors leads me to another ecological concept involving a spectrum this time between drivers of ecological change on one end of the spectrum um are so profound in their impact that they actually cause change whereas a passenger species is one which can only really occur there as a result of environmental change so it 's more a symptom rather than a cause of an environmental problem there are also species that some people called backseat drivers because they 're unable to cause environmental change in the outset but once another driver species transforms the landscape somewhat then the backseat driver species are able to take over some people also talk about transformer species but i don 't think we need to get concerned about that if your objective is to maximize the habitat for indigenous flora and fauna obviously the environmental weeds you need to focus on are the driver species not the passenger species some of the passenger species may even have redeeming features such as providing habitat for fauna opportunistic weeds along the edge of a path are classic passenger species and the traffic of feet along the edge that allows them to be there is the ecological driver weeds immediately downhill over the edge of a road or a in that case is things like runoff of moisture and nutrients and weed seeds dealing with the weeds themselves without dealing with the cause of them being there is fruitless unfortunately it 's often difficult to tell whether a species is more on the drivers end of the spectrum or the passenger end of the spectrum or somewhere in the middle here are some tests that i use most commonly the first is just a screening test if the species at issue represents only a small fraction of the foliage cover of its layer of vegetation and if it isn 't increasing over time without control it probably has low potential as a driver species that might not be the case if it has unusual properties such as being quite toxic to wildlife conversely a non-indigenous species that has high foliage cover like this clematis is capable of monopolizing sunlight soil moisture and nutrients and thereby potentially act as a driver however it 's only a driver if it isn 't relying on some other factor to make the environment suitable for it this panic belt grass is a case usually does under cherry ballart trees and that makes people often think that it 's a real problem and needs a lot of effort to control it people also find that after controlling it it keeps coming back and they just cannot get rid of it so it 's developed a popular reputation as the weed from hell however the species never moves very far here from underneath the cherry balance because of a particular property of what happens to soil underneath the cherry bell art species and so i would say that this species is not a driver species it 's more a passenger and the driver is what the cherry ballart species are doing to the soil underneath and any attempt to remove the panic belt grass without dealing with the driver that allows it to be here is fairly futile unfortunately cherry ballots are an important part of the woodland here and in a whole range of vegetation types in victoria so it 's not a simple matter to just get rid of the driver so in situations like this in this reserve we simply have to effectively remove panic felt grass and in fact that doesn 't matter quite as much as you might think because even in a pristine environment not many indigenous plants grow underneath cherry ballads so the panic field grass isn 't displacing a whole lot my next test for a driver species is to see whether when you remove a species the environment improves significantly as a result i 've already given you the example of sweet potassiums where on one side of the fence where they 've been allowed to grow there is very little native flora and fauna and on the other side of the fence where the sweet potassiums were removed the environment is much healthier with far more species of flora and fauna other scientists have shown scientifically that sweet potosporum can behave as a driver of ecological change in a range of vegetation communities in victoria my last and less favored test is to observe change over time in the absence of any control measures for example by watching a species spread across the area of interest with ecological deterioration occurring behind but not in front ecological principle for this video is what i call lorimer 's first law of weeding it is when in doubt don 't pull it out or don 't spray it out what i mean is don 't do any harm if you 're uncertain about the the identity of a particular plant and you think it might be an environmental weed don 't pull it out if you 're unsure whether it 's just an opportunistic weed or a driver weed or on the side of leaving it alone until you can check these things refer to other people who might have a better idea but you can do far more harm in inadvertently pulling out or destroying an indigenous species or destroying fauna habitat then you can ever make good over a thousand days of doing environmental weeding to summarize this video here are what i think are the take home messages number one when in doubt don 't pull it out point two whether a plant is an environmental weed depends on its capacity to displace indigenous flora and fauna point three ecological disturbances are important for ecosystem but they also promote environmental weeds point four the environmental weeds that depend most on disturbances are called opportunists there 's rarely any point in trying to remove them if the disturbance they thrive on is going to continue and point five there is a spectrum between driver species and passenger species which again helps determine how much importance to place on control of each environmental weed species but there are other equally important things that need to be taken into consideration when you 're working out the priority to be given to a particular environmental weed problem that will be the subject of the next [Music] video [Music] you _"

because part of learning is about finding out about all sorts of things and not always understanding them but trying to find out a little bit more each day let little talk about engineering i 'm still learning lots of things about engineering there 's lots and lots and lots to learn but i do find a little bit um i do like to have a bit of fun building things so that 's what we can try to do today i 've got something here that you might see poking out of some polystyrene and i just wonder if you think that this is going to be a fairly strong structure this is spaghetti and you might know about spaghetti because when it gets wet it goes awfully soft really really really soft and even when it 's dry let me show you what happens when you put some pressure on it it breaks really easily so i 'm not quite sure about whether this would be a good thing to build with i 've got some spaghetti here and it 's standing up because the polystyrene allows me to push it into the polystyrene like that i just wondered if i put something on the top of it what do you think might happen engineers have to think have to think about how heavy things might be what the force might be let me just check what 's the i built something using spaghetti it 's very very lucky that this polystyrene is very light i don 't think i could put anything else on top of that i 've just got a couple of books here should we give that a try i wonder if the spaghetti is going to be strong enough to allow a book to balance on top just what i thought that 's what i thought not strong enough the spaghetti just broke into pieces it 's not going to be working very well somebody told me that if i used spaghetti with polystyrene i 'd be able to stack lots of books on top of it i was told that if you use lots and lots and lots of splitty on some polystyrene then you might be able to add some books to the top of it i 've got one that i just prepared just earlier look at that spaghetti all over the place now just check to see if we and we know this polystyrene is quite light and we know that the book is quite heavy so i won 't drop it on i 'll just place it on carefully and we 'll see what happens to the spaghetti it is wobbling a little bit but it hasn 't collapsed shall we try another book it wobbled a bit more but the spaghetti sticks haven 't broken let 's try another small book i 'm a bit nervous about using those big ones here 's a third book it collapsed the spaghetti didn 't even break is just amazing and you know it 's called distribution of weight the weight of the polystyrene and the books has been distributed all around on top of all of those pieces of spaghetti and that 's what was helping it to stay up isn 't that amazing i love that perhaps you 'd be um you might like to try that at home just ask an adult for some spaghetti that you 're not using okay we 've also got some other things that we 've been building as well thanks to that we will be building from paper cups and maybe plastic cups maybe from straws maybe paper straws and we 've also got some pegs and we 've also have some sticks some isopod sticks and some other thicker sticks as well so come and have a little look over this way and see what we 've been building these are some of the things that you might have at your house that you might be able to build to make all sorts of structures i 've got some plastic cups some paper cups some straws and some blue tack to join them together to make all sorts of shapes and structures maybe you 'll have to join them up differently to make them a little bit stronger on one side or a little bit taller on one side or a little bit more balanced on the bottom and we 're using some pegs as well as some wooden sticks maybe you 'd like to make a bridge maybe you 'd like to make a tower maybe you 'd like to make a helicopter maybe you 'd like to make able to do at home and it doesn 't have to be the same thing every day you can pack all of these things up at the end of the day and build a different structure every day you can use your imagination because that 's what happens when engineers engineers are having a look at projects they need to use their imagination and they need to use all of their knowledge to find out what 's going to work to make sure that the structure is properly um built and to make sure that it 's safe and strong so have fun when you 're playing with all sorts of things from around the home and you you could be this could be the start of an engineering life for you have fun bye _"

because part of learning is about finding out about all sorts of things and not always understanding them but trying to find out a little bit more each day let bit of maths together today we 're going to make a maths game that you 'll be able to use at home every day perhaps if you make it yourself then you can modify it a little bit if you would like to but this is just a little hint about something that you might be able to do at home um you 'll just need a box of some sort like this it might be the lid from some photocopier paper or it might be the bottom of a shoe box or it could be something else that looks a bit like this but it needs to be quite shallow and it needs to be big enough so that you 'll be able to move something from side to side so see if you can find something like that i 'm not sure if you 've got some tubes or some cylinders at home but um you might need to make sure that they 're not too hard so that you 'll be able to cut them and make them smaller i have cut some already can you see about some maths because they 're not all the same size did you see that they look like they 're the same not the same length but i would have guessed that they were about the same size but they 're not because this one fits inside the other one that 's fairly amazing so the size will be really important after we 've put them inside the box because before we manage to do that we 'll have to find something that looks like a ball this is a ping pong ball a big marble maybe a small marble maybe you have a bouncy ball but we 'll need a ball of some sort we 'll just have to check before we use the um cylinders to make sure that the area inside there is big enough for the ball to pass through because when we 're finished with this game we 'll be making uh we 'll be making it look like this we have to make sure that the balls can roll through those there a little bit tricky here we go i 'm just going to to fit through this one there 's a problem so we couldn 't use this ping pong ball with this cylinder let 's try it with this one oh it did fit in will it fall out the bottom oh it 's still a little bit tight can you see that it doesn 't really fall through so if we were rolling something around in here and it and it couldn 't quite go through that opening it would get stuck let 's try the marble oh did you see that when i put the marble through it pushed the ping pong ball through there it is ping pong ball is stuck in the middle there i 'll put the marble in let 's try again oh the ping pong ball just dropped out of the bottom so we know that the marbles the right size just drops straight out let 's see if the marble there it is so the marble is okay what about the small marble will that roll faster or slower felt like it was a little bit faster there it is into the tub so to choose and how you need to how you 'll need to do some measuring before you start you might like to cut the cylinder into maybe one two three four five pieces you might have to measure it to check to see if they 're almost the same length it doesn 't matter if they 're not really the same length i 've got some extras over here i 've actually got six there one group of three and another group of three there but i don 't think i 've got room for six when i made this game another day i tried to put six of them in there but it was too crowded so each time i tried to roll the marble through there it wouldn 't work there were too many so have a think about that what i did then was i measured some paper i had to cut some paper so it was just the right size to change the color of that little cylinder and then as you can see i wrote some numbers on the top but i didn 't put to the three and the four is a long way away from the five so i just put them in there randomly and i 've also decorated the outside of the box maybe you 've got some stickers or maybe you 've got um some extra paper that you could decorate there will be a fair bit of measuring that you 'll need to do and measuring is a great thing to be learning about in maths so when you 've got it all in there i did stick these on with some sticky tape i had to make sure that the tape was double-sided so i stuck them on there with some sticky tape and then i 've got the marble and i 'm going to see if i can make the marble go through number four it 's going to be a bit tricky i hope you 'll be able to see it so i 'll just drop the marble in the box oh no it didn 't go near number four and look what 's happened at the bottom it got stuck between the number two and that a little wiggle get out of the way oh and that will be a bit better i 'll have to move the box from side to side oh and the marble just went through number five and then it went through number two and then it went through number three but i can 't quite get it up it went through number one and through number one and number three again i 'm just trying to get it through number four you have to go up and down and sideways hooray it just went through number four so you could play this game maybe as an addition game so you can add the numbers here the ball is going through number two number two so we have two and now he 's going to go through number five oh dear now we 've got two and five and we have to try to add them together okay if you 're very good at numbers you 'll know exactly how many that is you may not even need to use your fingers but maybe you could add three or four or maybe you could divide the numbers it depends on how old you are about what sort of calculations you 'll be able to make so there 's a maths game that you can have a little play with at home um you can build one yourself and see if the marble 's going to go all the way through a long time ago i think i measured these and i think the pink bumble ball goes through these let 's just check did you see that it came through but it still got stuck on the bottom here we go oh no now the bumpers are upside down oh there there they go again through number three upside down three so i 'm sure you 'll have a little bit of fun with that game a great game for watching a great game for learning all about adding and subtracting and maybe dividing so have fun with that just have one more thing to show you about max now all you 'll need are maybe some icy pole sticks these are a little bit bigger than my support sticks few of them because we 're going to make a catapult have you heard of a catapult before now it depends on how many sticks you 're going to use about how wide that space is going to be and you see that space is wide enough to put my finger through there and i think i made one that was a little bit the same wide enough to put my finger through there but if you used more sticks joined together and pushed them up through there that space there would be wider i can show you i threw in this space i 've got one two three four of them joined together with a rubber band rubber band on both sides let 's do that one two three four let 's try six five six okay we 'll join them together with a rubber band on one end to hold them firmly together and the other end now we 've got six on here there this one only has four so now we 'll need to put one on the top and one on the bottom and then put a rubber band at the top a bit tricky if you need an adult to help you or or someone else to help you to put it all together the rubber band holds them firmly together and now when i push six of them there did you see that that space is much wider now and this probably would make a catapult that would make something move in the air very very fast but sometimes when we 're pressing this down and making it flick up like that sometimes the stick can break so you 'll have to experiment about whether it 's good to use four or six or eight and see if it 's going to work but be prepared that sometimes it 's actually a little bit hard for the stick not to break or the stick might might um crack a little bit as well i 've got some pom-poms they 're very light and i 'm going to put a pom-pom on the end of the catapult i might try the one with four first and see what happens when i push down the oh good job what about a small one you think a small one would go higher i think it did i think it did go higher what about one that was even smaller i 'm not so sure maybe you just have to have a guess about how high the catapult made the pom-pom rise above the table i want to try the other catapult that we just made together now oh don 't know if it 's going to work or not let 's give it a try we 'll try the white one here we go oh i think it went higher i think it did let 's try the green one oh it 's gone right above even taller than me even with quite a big pink one i wonder if this is going to go high oh about a meter into the air i think how about that catapults are very good fun but it 's really really important that you use something on the catapult that 's not going to hurt anyone if it flies up through the air so see if you can find bit of paper perhaps and you can make something that isn 't going to hurt other people we don 't want that to happen at home so i hope you 've had fun today i hope that you um that you are using all of your mathematical skills to learn new things every single day thanks for joining me bye for now _"

you even though i 'm an adult i 've been learning for a very long time and i 'm still learning every single day i wonder what the word steam means we 've got s for science t for technology like scissors and computers and soda streams and what about e for engineering and a for arts and m for mathematics i do love mathematics we 'll have fun playing with some mathematical things another day if you would like to try some of these things at home make sure you 've got a big person to help you or an adult to help you and if you 're not sure about some of the things we 've talked about today perhaps you could research them and if i 've made a mistake can you please let me know because part of learning is about finding out about all sorts of things and not bit more each day let 's get started we 've got some more science things to do with you today um we 're going to have some science experiments um and i hope you have fun today we are going to talk about chemistry have you have you heard about chemistry before chemistry is the study of solids like a rock and liquids like water or other things and also gas hard for us to see some gases we can see some of them but not many of them so that 's what we 're going to talk about today i 've got some liquids here and we 're going to mix them together to see what 's going to happen when we mix two or more things together sometimes there 's a chemical reaction the chemical reaction that happens or maybe there 's lots of chemical reactions happening or maybe there 's just one so we 're going to mix some liquids together today to see what what we might find happens when we put the both of them together i 've got some coca-cola and we know that you might be able to hear it lucky it didn 't fizz over there it is some coca-cola some of the um the gas is escaping some of that carbon dioxide is escaping i 'll put some in here oh look what happens when i pour it has a chemical reaction happened already not yet did you see the froth on the top so there 's a liquid coca-cola just move those under the bay look there 's a liquid and another liquid we 've got milk and coca-cola when we mix both of these together what do you think might happen some coca-cola in the bottom and we 'll mix some milk inside there we could even stir it a little bit there is a chemical reaction happening in fact there 's more than one chemical reaction happening but one that we know about is the phosphoric acid that 's in the coca-cola is the molecules in there is mixing with the milk molecules and a reaction is happening now i read this in a book and i saw in the book that it looked different to this i like a pretty awful color when i looked in the book it told me that the color would change at the top and there would be a mass at the bottom so i want to show you one in a moment that i prepared last night i wonder how long it would take for that to happen what 's your hypothesis do you think it might take one minute do you think it might take one hour do you think it might take one day it happened overnight and here is what happened had coca-cola and milk mixed together and look it 's a little bit clear at the top and there 's a mass at the bottom when the milk molecules mixed together with the phosphoric acid from the from the coca-cola so maybe you 'd like to have a try to do that at home some things don 't happen instantly we have to wait until the reaction happens or the reaction finish is happening so there it is we 've got some other liquids to put together as well you may have seen this one before i looks fabulous if you have it on a plate a white plate looks perfect i 'll put some milk in this plate maybe you 've done this experiment at home there some milk in the bottom of the plate and next i 'll see if we can make the colors mix together without stirring anything so there 's a few colors there 's one color and here 's the next i don 't want to let them join together just yet there some food coloring from the kitchen how could we make the food the food coloring join together to make a new color i 've got some dishwashing liquid yes it 's a liquid have you heard of that word before dishwashing liquid and if i put a little bit of dishwashing liquid in here what do you think might happen do you think um a new color will be formed a few drops did you see that there 's a little bit of green in the middle because this liquid is actually green there i 'll drop a little bit more on there if you keep watching it i 'm not even bumping bumping the table it 's still moving because the molecules in the detergent are attaching to the molecules of the milk the fat molecules and that 's why dishwashing liquid is so good for cleaning fatty dishes because it joins together with the fat and then helps to wash it away doesn 't that look fabulous i think we might try another chemical reaction now i 've got the lemon that i cut in half there it is and that 's where the seeds are inside there talking about food is science as well science is just every everywhere all around us now i 've cut the lemon in half and now i 'm going to put some bicarbonate of soda on top of it just hold it up like that just put it on top i see a chemical reaction happening soon oh it 's a little bit lumpy some bicarbonate of soda on top of half of a lemon and we 'll put a little bit of food color on top a little bit of food color but maybe a little bit of hear but i can hear a little bit of hissing i can see a little bit of bubbling did you see some bubbles there i 'll squeeze some more lemon juice that 's acidic and let it mix with the bicarbonate of soda and it 's going to make some more carbon dioxide did you see those bubbles there they are there 's more of them chemical reactions are happening everywhere in our world we 've got some other things that we might mix together i love mixing things up let 's give this a try let 's mix a little bit of milk i wonder what might happen if we mix milk with balsamic vinegar it 's vinegar this is white vinegar and this is balsamic vinegar it 's dark vinegar this is an acid in here and when we mix it with the milk something might happen something 's happening to the milk can you see something happening at the bottom it 's changing into a solid there 's a mass at the bottom because the acid and the milk mix together and mixing those molecules caused a disgusting certainly won 't be drinking that milk before you use all of the milk out of the fridge make sure you ask an adult to help you if you 're using them to to do some experiments like this let 's see what might happen when we put some food colour into the oil do you think a chemical reaction will happen there 's the oil it is a liquid we can pour it i wonder if the color will mix with the oil are they mixing together i don 't think so the droplets of food color are just sinking to the bottom they 're staying in shape that could be just a little bit like a lava lamp let me move it around they might move around a little bit but most of them have just sunk to the bottom can you see them there two liquids that didn 't want to mix together there i hope you 've had fun today we 've had some special experiments very simple experiments that are a little bit of fun you can try some of these at home but be able to see you another day thanks for joining me bye for now _"

we 're going to have to talk about science and we 've got some things to show you about science there are some strange words when we talk about science have you ever heard of the word hypothesis what a strange word i wonder what hypothesis might mean it means just to have a guess have a little try have a little think about what might happen have a think about why it might happen have you heard about chemistry chemistry is the study of solids like a rock and liquids like some water and gas i wonder where we could find some gas do you know about gas um i 've got gas inside my body i wonder if there 's any gas inside this bag is there any air or any gas inside there it 's flat i 'll open it up can you see any gas in there lots of gases are very difficult to see i 'll see if i can put some gas in there from my body let me see if i can blow it up to make the hole a little bit smaller oh it 's not working so well but there is a little bit of air inside there even though you can 't see it and now it might be starting to escape i 've got a small bag here maybe if i try to put some air in there you 'll see what happens oh i could feel the air blowing back on my hair but the air 's not staying in there i was able to squash it all out i think you 'll know about balloons and what we can put inside balloons when i blow air into the balloon will it get bigger or smaller i think you 've guessed it just with one puff and another puff more air oh did you see that how did that happen the balloon was moving all by itself i think the air was trying to escape so fast that it made the balloon move all over the place um i 've got another little experiment to try with a balloon it 's about a balloon on a string have you ever i 've got a balloon just over here and it 's attached to a string with a straw on the top of it and the straw is stuck on with some sticky tape to make sure it stays on the balloon and the straw is threaded through a piece of string and i 've tied it to two different chairs one chair at this end and there 'll be another chair at the other end and i 've made the string quite tight now because i want the balloon to move i didn 't tie a knot in the balloon just yet because that would hold all of the air inside it i just twisted the top of the balloon around and then i stuck a peg on it there 's a peg from the clothesline you could borrow one perhaps so there 's a peg on there and hopefully that has stopped the balloon from going down and getting smaller but when i take the peg off what do you think might happen what is your hypothesis about what might happen do you think the balloon will stay still think the balloon will get smaller do you think the balloon might move it doesn 't have any wheels but let 's have a look i 'm just going to take the peg off the bloom let 's see what happened they got smaller and it moved but not very fast maybe you can try that at home maybe you can see what happens if the string is really really long or maybe if the string is short or maybe if the balloon is really really um full of air much much bigger than that one so give that a try we 've got some liquids here there 's some water in here that 's a liquid and there 's some water in here and something else there 's gas and water in there there 's probably a little bit of air in the top of that one and there 's air on top of that one because i can see something coming up the side i was very lucky to have a soda stream when i take the lid off no bubbles in there but i can put some stream that somebody has made this is wonderful technology in the back of the soda stream there 's an air canister and in that air canister there 's carbon dioxide so i 'm going to put some carbon dioxide into this water and we 'll see what happens i have to push it in here very carefully lift it up and then i have to push from the top did you see what 's happening and one more perhaps now when i take the water out there 's bubbles in there but they 'll escape really quickly unless i put the lid on so when i put the lid on that will hold it quite tight and the bubbles will stay in there for a little while that 's called soda water and it 's a little bit like some of the drinks that you might have some time so it 's got carbon dioxide in there we mixed it with some water we mixed a gas with a liquid and look what we 've made i 'm going to try to do a little bit more um with air used to have some soda in there but now it 's empty or is it really empty i wonder i don 't think there 's any liquid in there and there 's no solid in there is there any gas in there i can 't see anything in there i wonder if i try to blow in there if i can get some air inside there let 's give it a try oh it 's not changing shape i thought it might have got a bit bigger no nothing much is happening let me just check i can 't feel anything i can 't see anything but there really is air in there there is we can 't see it and i can show you when i 've got these two bottles to have a think about i 've put a balloon inside this bottle you might be able to play to do this at home there 's a balloon inside this little bottle and i 've pulled it over the rim of the bottle and i 'm going to see if i can blow up that balloon do you like we did before it 's quite easy you just blow and it gets bigger but when the balloon 's inside the the um bottle we 'll just check what is your hypothesis will it or won 't it i 'm blowing as hard as i can and it doesn 't seem to be blowing up oh that made an awful noise no it 's not blowing up i 'll just check the other one they look a bit the same i 'll see if it 's going to work inside this bottle big breath did you see that the balloon did blow up inside the bottle but there 's a little trick at the bottom of this bottle it 's all closed and the balloon is over the rim of that part so it 's all closed but what you might not have been able to see is i put a little hole in there inside this one there 's a little hole and that let the air that 's inside that bottle escape when the balloon was filled with air and pushed all of that air out through a trick maybe you could play this game with some adults and show them how much you know about air the balloon can 't get much bigger but it forces the air out of the bottle i think that 's a great trick okay so we couldn 't blow up this bottle we could blow up the balloon in the bottle that had the hole in the bottom but we couldn 't blow up the balloon in the bottle with no hole because there 's lots of air inside there that we can 't see and there 's nowhere for that air to go it can 't escape so it won 't let the balloon blow up how about that now i wonder if we could try a chemical reaction to see if we can blow up a balloon do you think that would be possible do you know what a chemical reaction is it 's when we mix two or more things together to see if we can change it into something else to make a new substance a chemical reaction i 've got some vinegar that we 'll bicarbonate of soda have you heard of that before or baking powder they 're a little bit the same so we 're going to use a bottle a small one and we 're going to use some vinegar we 're going to put the vinegar in the bottom of the bottle in the bottom here and we need three quarters of a cup of vinegar that we 'll put in the bottle but you perhaps need to use a funnel to get it in there so put the funnel on the top and pour the um the vinegar in the bottom that will be the safest idea and then we 'll need to fill up a balloon with some bicarbonate of soda we need three teaspoons so that 's three teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda in the balloon but don 't put it in the bottle just yet i have to put the vinegar in first three quarters of a cup so there 's a line on here that will show me three quarters of a cup not quite a cup three quarters it looks a bit like water it vinegar is going to go into the bottom of the bottle lucky that 's not the one with the hole in it okay now i 'm going to use the same funnel to see if i can put some bicarbonate of soda inside the balloon i 've got some here so i need to put three teaspoons or a little bit more what 's a bit lumpy into the blue the funnel will help it to go in there shake shake shake all the way down when we mix bicarbonate of soda with vinegar a chemical reaction happens we 've got some some bicarbonate of soda in the bottom of that balloon and what we 're going to do is very very carefully stretch the balloon over the top like that now we know that that 's where the bicarbonate of soda is so when we tip it up like that oh did you see what 's happening a chemical reaction happened there 's bubbles inside there we 've made carbon dioxide and then that 's what blew up the balloon so i don 't have to blow up balloons for today i hope you 've had fun i 'll see you another time bye-bye _"

construction and it smells amazing we 've got all the beds made of red gum and it just smells fresh it smells amazing so today we 're talking about soil health and why we need to improve the soil to keep our veggies happy and healthy and healthy so why do we need to keep the soil healthy soils integral parts so without good soil yeah you won 't get any good produce basically so the end of the day the poorer quality the soil the poorer quality the outcome so the yield will be less we smaller and won 't taste appeal to the better the soil a better tasting fridge okay fantastic so how do we know that we 've got good quality soil well here in Frankston well the hardest parts is actually close to the beach so they 're close to the sentence we got a sandy sort is it won 't retain moisture or it actually stops the moisture from coming through so one of the biggest things in growing obviously you need moisture to grow anything so water so water retention is critical is we 've sandy sort of soils your legs to a point where you put your hand into the soil it 'll be really hard on the surface and then when you pick it up it 'll just fall through your fingers right so that 's the biggest difference between a good soil and a bad soil when you pick up good soil be able to make a ball in your hand and will hold its shell shape along and then obviously again where is if you have even poorer quality soil from a clay point of view you 'll be able to mold it into a ball and it 'll stay as a ball and that 's the opposite of what you want so here in Frankston we have this end we have one end of the scale and we want to find that happy medium in between the two perfect example of standard garden saw we have everywhere when you pick it up you can see just pretty dry now it 's rained a lot recently so when you pick it up you try and make a ball it just sort of falls apart whereas this soil which is in the garden bed which is full of manures organics and things like that is when you pick it up it starts to hold its shape and that 's what you want does that is a really good indicator of good soil now what makes that a good soil it has a lot of organics in it organics is any sort of green waste so I mean ooh is one of the greatest things will do and you can put that into this if you mix manure into that it can turn into that so if you have that in your garden it 's not the end of the world you can definitely turn it into this and it 's a really good base to start from so you add compost manure those kinds of really rich rich organics and do you what if we wanted to use chemical fertilizers to about for example is that going to harm the soil in any way it 'll definitely change the microbiome which is basically little tiny organic organisms in your soil to keep it healthy so if you add chemicals into your swing it 'll actually strip all the nasties out of it that 's what it 's full but it strips all the good things out of it as well so then you have to replace that with it so that 's when fertilizers become important but if you keep if you put chemicals in your soil and then fertilizers you 're actually just repeating the cycle so what you want to do is try and steer clear of chemicals and actually just put those natural organics those see saucers seaweeds those kinds of bases into it worm juice for example it can get into that and you 'll actually get a really good rich that 's fantastic and how do we know what sort of soil doesn 't matter what sort of soil we use the different vegetables it does the Frankston I would not grow them in our soil it just won 't work you 're better off growing it in a pot in rows for Azalea move so really lots of different type of soil generally most veggies of pH neutral all that means is the soil is a neutral level everything kind of grows in a grass your trees your veggies and things like that when you start increasing your nitrogen levels or you take that out of the soil you 've really got a specialized high planted and blueberries are really good example fantastic if we wanted to maybe just grow something in a pot can we just use topsoil or something that we sneaked up and just put that in a pot or do we need specific you can you said you could definitely dig up some soil from the garden but again they 'll have to put something else into it so a potting mix is a really good way to start really good way in a pot however over time the plant is eating the nutrients out of that soil so you need to fertilizer need to put in a sea salt seaweed kind of fertilizer or worms or things like that or even put some tanbark will put some other sort of compost around the top of it and let it listen oh this is about to ask you about that I notice there 's no mulch or anything here is such is that because this is so new one of the reasons it could its own you at this time of the year mulch is not in there 's not an integral part of it because it rains so much that the bed stay moist summer especially there is a garden that over there that 's got a lot of mulch in it really in summer yes you definitely need to have a mulch around whether that 's a peach through or whether that 's just your standard pine bark mulch things like that that kind of thing is beautiful just to keep that moisture in the soil otherwise you 'll lose the moisture it dries out it goes hard and you end up and then you have to start the whole 's been great learning about soils and specifically what we 've got to work with in Frankston how do people find you the best way to find this is off the Frankston City Council website as well as our Facebook page scan on community garden and you can come down the Kanto preserve off the record car park entrance thanks you _"

    "text": "like my name is Lindsay Fraser and I 'm from LAN design partnership and we 're a company of landscape architects and we 've been asked by the city of Frankston to prepare a master plan for either port park in Frankston south the purpose of this video is to provide a brief overview of the thematic directions plan that has been prepared for the park and which is on councils website for comment until April the 27th the thematic directions has been prepared from a combination of meetings with council officers through discussions with the clubs and groups who are tenants on the reserve and also through discussions with the community who attended an information session last December and then provided comment on their thoughts on the reserves during January the formatic directions really respond to the existing conditions of the reserve and also to the aspirations of the users and the community as to how they 'd like to see the park in the future and what they value about the park now and what they might like to see changed into the future I 'll briefly outline to help you make comments on the plan on councils website one of the key issues at Overboard Park is parking and access particularly on busy sports days and around the the main sports ovals the recent road and car parking works have been undertaken by the senior Frankston will go a long way to resolving those issues into easing those car parking issues one of the directions of the of the master plan will be also to investigate improved access and parking along over port road around oval number one as you 'll know there 's a couple of existing car parks here and one of the directions is to investigate the potential to enlarge those car parks and to provide some connection between them to make better use of those car parks and to make circulation around the oval clearer for people that will lower involve some investigation into the existing pine trees that occur along over port road and into their health and into their condition and their longevity into the future but one of the directions will be to investigate replacement of those trees with other those car parks signage also on over port Road will be important to direct people to which relevant car park they 're coming to depending upon what activity they 're visiting at the reserve so they 'll be important aspects in terms of improving parking and an accessibility into the reserve overflow parking occurs in this area down here this open grass area near over one on busy sports days as users of the reserve will know on peak days that gets used heavily for overflow parking the direction for the master plan is to retain the use of this area for dog off leash walking and for informal recreation such as ballgames but also to improve the soil profile and the surface of this area to enable it to cope with that car parking demand on busy sports days while retaining a well grass and well-drained surface for useful informal recreation for the rest of the weekend at other times as well as the southern grass area the northern grassed area in the northeast of the park will also be retained for its dog or flesh activity and also and both of these areas the southern grass area and the northern grass area will be enhanced through a range of open space improvements such as shelters seats and potentially drinking fountains and dog bowls they are importantly both of these open Lord areas will also be enhanced through the provision of a path network a clearly defined and connect the network of paths which will connect all areas of the park with each other so not only perimeter paths around these areas but a network of paths that will connect all activity areas within the park these paths will be suitable for a range of activities such as jogging strolling dog walking and they 'll connect the key focal activity areas that occur within the reserve there 'll be a number of different paths materials that will be used for those paths depending upon where the paths occur so for instance in a central area and around the main activity ovals the path is likely to be a formal path such as an exposed aggregate colored concrete in more remote areas particularly along Sweetwater Creek and through the informal gravel surface therefore a softer surface importantly this path network will connect all of the activity areas and create a series of loop paths that people can take as they wish to and also connect to the residential areas that surround the park one of the important directions of the master plan will be the beautification and enhancement of the landscape aspects of the park this will include the whole of the park through councils ongoing maintenance and management programs but there are a few specific areas highlighted on the thematic directions plan which I just like to point out the first one is one that we 've already mentioned the existing pine trees alone over port Road will be looked at in terms of the healthy mature trees and they 're becoming older trees they 'll be looked at in terms of their health and their longevity and potentially will be replaced over time with new plantings that will allow for clearer views into the reserve and will allow for better turf management of this side of over one so that will the intent of that will need to road interface which is largely hidden at the moment the dam down here to the southwest of ovale number one is intended to be improved as well and it 'll be investigated as to whether the dam can be opened up whether there can be structures such as decks and jetties that might allow people to interact with the water body and also some additional planting safety will be a key consideration in all of that so the thematic direction is certainly to investigate the potential for improved activity and improved access to the dam area I guess it 's fair to say that the dam is seen as an underused area that could be used more beneficially for the benefit of the community that used the park vegetation will also be an important aspect of the master plan particularly along Sweetwater Creek which defines the majority of the eastern boundary of the of over port park and revegetation will have fee I guess the intent of providing for biodiversity enhanced by diversity to contributing to broader habitat corridors along the Sweetwater crude to the north and to the south park particularly those who might use these trails that are existing along the Sweetwater Creek corridor as well as the natural areas says Bush land there is a long Sweetwater Creek the master plan is encouraging the investigation into the old have homestead site here and trying to understand what its vegetation might have been like in its original form and really treating this area as a new community space that contrasts with the areas of the park around it certainly this garden area contrasts greatly with the sweet Laurel Creek character and contrasts greatly with the active sports areas so we see that there 's an opportunity to provide a new activity in this area a place for respite a place for shade and for comfort and a more of an exotic garden character that might have reflected the old homestead character so the direction there is to investigate the old homestead and to return that area to a pleasure garden something of its former character with a mix of exotic and deciduous and evergreen trees in all of these passive landscape areas the open grass the areas that old homestead garden stormwater management will be an important direction at the moment stormwater is largely uncontrolled as it enters as it hits the ground and runs off the of the site and so the intent is in all of these works to manage stormwater to treat it to slow down its access into Sweetwater Creek to manage erosion and to provide a more sustainable future for stormwater into the future in addition to these two directions for the passive landscape areas of the park the existing active Sports spaces over one a table and the tennis complex up here in the north are intended to be retained in their in their current form and certainly to be improved over time as councils ongoing as part of councils ongoing management and maintenance of those areas but in addition to those active sports spaces the master plan considers two new active facilities the first is the potential for a multi-line netball court space here in the center of the reserve away from residential boundaries and away from the more natural and passive areas of the reserve to provide a facility that the moment we have a football netball Club but no net ball facilities so the direction that leads to investigate a netball court that could occur here with multi-line markings to be used for a variety of other sports by the community when it 's not been used by the Football Netball club itself the second active sports facility is to formalize the existing informal bike track that occurs here just near the open grassed area that we 've already spoken about to formalize that into a facility that can be used by a range of users children particularly to learn to ride to enjoy riding their bikes and to do that in a sustainable and a manageable way with a more formalized facility importantly that facility will be located in the area that it is at the moment not to extend much further into the grass theory so that we 're not losing any of those grass areas and away from residential boundaries to avoid any of those interface issues in summary the suggested directions for out of port park are really to build upon the existing spaces that that occurs to maintain and all of the user groups that are there at the moment and to provide for their needs and to introduce a couple of new activities that support the existing clubs the resident on the reserve council looks forward to receiving your comments on the thematic directions plan and to contributing to the preparation of the final master plan in the coming couple of months thanks very much _"

the community on the subject at that times the budget process and the details of the budget document can be complex at the outset it is important to highlight the council is a break-even organization it does not make a profit in other words all cash income is spent or allocated to providing services and building infrastructure for the community each year there is often a misconception that when the income statement shows a surplus that this is a profit this is incorrect the operating surplus is required to deliver capital expenditure if council does not have an operating surplus then over time councils ability to deliver community infrastructure is limited and council would become financially unsustainable under the Local Government Act Council is required to prepare and adopt an annual budget for each financial year the budget includes information about the rates and charges to be levied the capital works programs to be undertaken the in November December where assumptions for the next five years are updated to council 's long term financial plan financial projections for the five years are set based on mark and market conditions labor costs based on the enterprise agreement and the rate cap set by the minister the first year of this long term financial plan is then used as the base budget during January and February council officers review their base budget and adjust figures influenced by changes in regulations service levels or capital funding requirements executive management conduct robust and now of the budgets to ensure that council is providing value for money and levels of service required by the community within the scarce resources available over the past five years Council has made a concerted effort to become efficient and introducing initiatives to reduce costs and maximize income counselors are involved in a number of briefings to review the draft budget a proposed budget is prepared in accordance with the act and submitted to Council in May for approval in principle council then makes the budget available to the public for review borrow its website or can make a submission on any proposal contained in the budget and these submissions are considered before adoption the final step is for council to adopt the budget adopting the budget pride of 30 through 30th of June is a legislative requirement and ensures that the organization can commence the new year with strategic direction council has little autonomy to increase its revenue and has to work within limited resources to deliver services and build infrastructure over 60% of council 's income is received from rates and charges the increase of this income source is controlled by the Victorian Government with the introduction of rate capping also a large part of councils income is operating grants capital grants and statutory fees which are again set by other levels of government and often do not reflect the true cost to provide the services and infrastructure that the funding is intended user fees and charges are set by council and are reviewed annually to ensure that costs to deliver the services are covered unless a council decision has been made to subsidize the charge to ensure affordability for the community examples of central centenary Park Golf Course fees for disposing items at the recycling center boat launching fees for hire and many others this graph essentially shows councils average rates per assessment compared to 14 other Eastern councils the rates per assessment at Franklin City Council is sitting very close to the average of all councils and that won 't change from 2015-16 onwards as all councils are constrained by the rate cap and the results will continue to be quite similar of the rates and charges income over 80% is received from residential properties which includes houses and units this is unlike some councils who have a large section of their rates being sourced from commercial and industrial properties a large component of councils expenditure is employee costs many council services are delivered through our workforce and these costs increase through the enterprise bargaining agreement which is set outside of the budget process the council to reduce employee costs would mean a reduction in services to the community materials and services are also a large part of councils costs which include contracts again agreed upon outside of the budget process examples council has little ability to reduce these costs during the budget process most of these costs are not linked to CPI increases usually they can be driven by other cost increases such as the construction index or fuel costs utility costs such as electricity gas and water continue to escalate well above CPI which puts additional pressure balancing the budget depreciation amortization in this graph is a book entry and that is based on accounting standards over the past five years Council has worked hard to reduce its expenditure looking for efficiencies and identifying ways of living within its means capital works is a large part of councils budget process and is essentially building and renewing councils assets and facilities asset renewal is an important component of our capital works program that ensures existing community assets are renewed and replaced as they reach the end of their useful lives capital projects are prioritized based on an asset management framework this graph highlights that renewal expenditure is considerable to ensure that the assets remain at the required standard fit for purpose discretionary funds are used to provide upgrades and new capital the recycling center the capital works program is funded largely by REITs income and ultimately councils operating surplus result therefore it is important to continue to minimize costs and maximize income so that a significant capital program can be delivered rate capping has limited our ability to deliver an extensive capital program grants received from the government are also used to fund capital projects total budget expenditure is in excess of 200 million and typically seventy percent is operating in nature and 30 percent is spent on the capital program a different way of looking at how council spends its money is to view how each 100 expense is split across all services and capital works for example during 2018 2019 council spent 32 41 cents out of each 100 on its capital works program similarly six dollars and two cents of each 100 dollars was spent on aged services and so on by the end of 2018 2019 council will have 28 million dollars in line for borrowings two years ago this figure was 37 million council is conscious of keeping its loan borrowings to a minimum however borrowings park aquatic facility and the Frankston recycling center loans were also used to fund the landfill liability some years ago and the superannuation defined-benefit call council loans to rates ratio is less than half of the maximum Prudential ratio limit of 60 percent set by the Victorian Government which means council is in a good position putting this in perspective this can be compared to a guaranteed house holding income of a hundred thousand dollars and having an outstanding mortgage of 28,000 most of you would be comfortable to manage this financial position and this is the current situation of council in terms of its borrowings so what does all this mean at the end of the day council strives to deliver services build infrastructure and renew its assets but most importantly council needs to remain and continue to be a financially sustainable organization you can see from this graph that over the past few years council has come a long way to ensure that its underlying operating result has shifted from a deficit surplice it must be emphasized again that this surplice is not a profit it is a from Council has rating stability for the community but its financial sustainability diminishes in the long term which means essentially that funding of capital works will also reduce over time this is due to the impact of rate capping had we not had this introduced councils surplus would have been consistent in future years and would have been in a better position to provide more infrastructure and services to the community rate capping will be with Victorian councils for a long time and therefore it will continue to challenge councils financial sustainability in years to come Council will also continue to face financial challenges in the future and ultimately it will need to make hard decisions in order to live within its means so in summary today I highlighted the process the council follows in building its budget I 've discussed the key components of council 's budget and also provided some insights into the challenges that council may face in the future I hope you have found this presentation helpful and look forward to your participation during the submissions process thank you [Music] _"

Frank 's our unhappiness the land thank you for inviting me along today and well first off we 'll start off with Anna Marie 's she is a local and she will speak about bryceton and what you 've seen over years and the changes and how has affected the Aboriginal community within the Franklin City area I 'm very nervous I must say that um first of all I 'll say that I 'm a very good yulhee Order woman my mother the audio to come Regina lady I was born in this area I was born actually at Chelsea at home in about 39 1958 1939 so I haven 't seen quite a lot of changes and different things Frankston many years ago was known as a resort area I think the first lot of land that was sold he was 18 54 and we were very proud raised supporting the wrong people I remember my grandmother talking to my mother about Sweetwater Creek which his name can I look down and when the lifesaver Club is my grandmother came from there she lived in the mirror mirror which I was on the foreshore so I had a lot to do to do with my grandmother until she passed on what else I can remember coming with my grandfather around Princeton area in Davey Street to see where my mother went to school a little school that 's up there I think there was about 12 pupils at that time there and the only other school was in muddy Allen yeah that state school on the station Street side I remembered the Nepean highway was called Bay Street at that time fairness now than the my way mechanics hall near the Royal it 's just the mechanics hall and they had the exchange to telephone exchange in those days what else the opponents what 'll Pele yes I 'll fade your memories today yeah I have seen a lot of changes and different names of the Canon of Crete which was called Terra norm and I can remember like that Frankston was spelt after an English general which is Frank 's friend Tom great stone that 's exactly yeah and then then they 've changed it to several other names and of Frankston yes we 've had French spoons yes we 'll see only come here the green what 's the only Greta the only pup here and unfortunately the partners one partner murdered the other one when he was hung that very day can go on a bit of patience but that 's that 's the point about yani aboriginal people we don 't just stick to the one topic but all has it come to you memory no I like Satya murtis he said this in the car about the hill what are the all of us hill all of us Hill was a burial ground my side mister Victoria market an Aboriginal burial ground and one of the Chieftains that was up there his head is being decapitated and it 's still in Eagle and in the museum body parts on that because of the the markings on the face and the symbol and the markings are how high and prestige the the hunter was you know things like that blood getting back to Gary EADS a football player when he done that dance some people said he to us it was a dance of victory you know say he got the last goal so he deserved to do that dance and he was proud but unfortunately because we don 't educate people at the primary school we should start first of all about the first people so people can understand our culture and how we feel about and when you talk about land you know we 're talking about our mother earth the provider of everything she provides our food she provides l should provide some warmth in wooden even certain trees bark and that they used to make shoes and the seniors from the kangaroo they tied those bark around them so all the you know you 've gotta have respect and you can I understand culture to understand how we think about Ln we 're very very passionate about our being and and our pride and even if you 're a white skin like I am I feel very much for my my family my mother 's culture very more so than the Irish side of my father coming up coming here as a botanist police station that went up in I think it was Davis Street the corner of debut lane or something like that and the wood yard we used to get coal from that 's it yes we used to go there and a horse trail with my friends grandpa and then there was another one in crane Street where that young girl was murdered and her body was found quite a while back and then later on the other two moves that was the first two minutes of to dust in Cannon or taken from the station that started coming people don 't realize that never a lot of people don 't realize also that main Warren was quite a famous place it was the biggest military place in the ha 'la Toria incentives and all of them Frankston North was all Navy homes in those days do you remember Francis a station had a little kiosk conduct and the only time he ever seen a lot of people coming here was Easter and Christmas now get there Billy came to go the shop paid tuppence for a bill he came and stuff like that in those days did you find yourself because you were more lighter skinned yes except people used to live in my grandma when she was with me and they used to say you Kara has to stay out so and they couldn 't use the toilets that was very surprising yes segregation part so that was very high and I can remember my mum later on laughing about her and one other Aboriginal lady when you went to school you used to get in the line and then play god save the queen '_''_726.98 you 'd march in and you have to bow or something before this picture of the Queen and they refused to do it and they refused to wear shoes I said her always in always in trouble you know my mum said this little black duck he 's not doing that was all we 'll always proud and grandma used to hide us because being so white skinned and things like that which was pretty hard and then as you grow up like um I have a lot of people that say the state for the state trustee I 've done a painting and then I had an exhibition and a lady come up and she liked my paintings and one in particular she really wanted and I had my resume up there with my number on it and everything to prove who I was you know and that I am Aboriginal that she took while looking the he 'd come back like a chicken cheese oh my goodness she said you could be in a lot of trouble and I said what for she said you can 't go do these those dots and that kind of work and say that you 're Aboriginal well have what do I have to be you know I know who I am and I said well if you had and read my resume you want to found that I 'm a legal person and and stuff like that then and then she calmed down she said well my dear you don 't look at the region effect you don 't have to say you are Oh what an insult you know I 'm not when you say something to them you only got a a bit of white in them their coffee color than that I can understand the pain that they go through all the time of being questioned because of the color of the skin it is very degrading it is very uncertain you know where your heart is is where you are and you don 't belong until you find out really who you are I 've got friends that are Aboriginal and they 're they 're white and they didn 't know who they were and I said then give me a name can you give me a name or a tribe because I can remember different families the walkers were the first Aboriginal family in in Frankston area and then the Nicholson past the Nicholson 's family they were the second a lot of people that were here and then there was a lot of mixed race up at Maudie alley where the last great hunter was Jimmy Dunbar can you remember that well he was the last race up there the Jimmy Dunbar so he ended up dying from more yelling to the Alfred hospital we two days and the he 's Doc 's 12 to 14 dots followed because hunters always had dogs the your dog was your protector he would go and fetch whatever you it would keep you warm in the wintertime he would keep rats or mice away because a black fella just ate something through it at the back of him you know whatever think like that so the dog was a great protector okay we 'll leave it at that how 's that [Applause] _"

picnic hampers and the drivers down to Port C for a picnic very nice and we stopped in in Frankston to have a drink because it was the only place on a Sunday outside the limits from Melbourne that you could have a drink but my next visit it was when I migrated with my wife and daughter in June 1959 I saw this job advertised for a salesman in the furniture electrical shop had just been built so I came down on the train and when we got off it was a 40-degree day by the way and and the bus flies were in plague proportions all round as he could hardly see and as we were coming down the ramp to get into Yonge Street they stopped us there 's this big film crew all around [Music] all of a sudden these big fogging machines came in and they fill and choking to kill off all all the Flies when when it 's all cleared on loudhailer they were telling us to stay there we 'll give you the order you charged across the road and there was Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck and Anthony Perkins and Fred Astaire doing doing a little routine tap dance song on the side so they said right charge and we moved across Stoppers no they didn 't like the take go back three times so he had to do it and I was going for an interview and I was two hours late [Music] hello my name is Glenn Davina I am president of the Frankston Historical Society and we run Balon Park homestead for Franklin City Council I 've been in Frankston since 1960 I 've lived in Korengal for 38 years and prior to that I lived in William Street in Frankston so I 've always been at the center of what 's happening in Frankston and I absolutely love it after World War one we had a group of French soldiers of course they were given you know a slap-up I guess for what they 'd done you know to fight with with the Australians New Zealanders all the old cars were there it was sort of quite a big celebration and those times you have to remember that people had had enough they 'd been through a war the First World War and they 'd had enough so they wanted a little bit of gaiety I think Frankston became the arts colony Keith and Elisabeth Murdoch came to Cruden farm valencies came out to Melbury Hill Harry and nan McClellan brother and sister came to to the beach and of course Harry bought 40 acres out here at Lane Warren which became McClellan gallery after his death lots of the famous artists came you know McCubbin although all the famous artists of the day later on in the twenties they wanted to to have a little bit more enjoyment lots of dancers went on the village that as Frankston was in those days they all got together to do things for for different celebrations everything that you know I mean the sketch jumper is a good example [Music] it the 13th January 1935 this was the biggest deal out and the town of Frankston was entertain and it was a little village in the first six days 62,000 people came to Frankston imagine catering for four sixty two thousand Babel they came from all over the world India Africa you know England [Music] my father was a scout leader and he came to the Frankston Jamboree and there was quite interesting that the Jamboree wasn 't only the first held in the southern hemisphere it became a world Jamboree because of the centenary of Victoria well they were in tents that would have about five or six young people I suppose in one way it 'd be like a huge army camp a lot of them built their own gateways depicting from where they came from and the many languages spoken but they had the common language of scouting baden-powell did come the he was the founder of course and really welcomed the invitation to attend because he was wasn 't a very tall men and it wasn 't very young on to say at this stage he always the young young scarce it went with my dad and their tales from that time were really really great it did have a lasting effect on them it started the the regrowth I think of Frankston for the few years until until World War two happened and then of course you know you 're back to where you started again [Music] I was carried in my father 's arms at six months of age to Frankston where he was about to start a medical practice as a young doctor my brother was three and we settled on the corner of Fiocchi Avenue and Nepean highway when the avenue of Honor still existed then the war intervene and dad went to war at that stage mum had been left some money and she bought at a cottage on Gould Street and the interesting thing about Gould Street there was that it was full of children and most of us were fatherless because our dads were at the wall we swam and we lit bonfires on the beach until a mom screamed at us and said come on in it 's dark if we pulled hard and there was plenty of fish we got a fish to take home to our mums it was a wonderful childhood because we were safe we were greatly loved and we were free I arrived in Frankston when I was about two years old so I 'm told and from there while I lived in the middle of Frankston until the 50s one of my earliest memories was with my father so I would have been about six years old he worked for Davey 's bakery which was situated on the corner of Wall Street and Yonge Street and he used to deliver bread to all of Frankston we do that way before luncheon the other way after lunch I can recall even going as far out as dr. Vincent 's there was about the outskirts of France and at that stage I have been in Frankston all my life I was born in June 1938 at max Wilton before the hospital was built here in 1941 I grew up in Bay Street which is Nana pian Highway up until I was about 10 my mother cafe there for 20 years until 1958 there were lots of dances around town there was themed sonic hauled and the soldiers haul a lot of the young ones used to come in and have supper after the dances and other people used to come at interval from the picture theater and plain Street which was the old plaza theater which is now a deserted building I was born in Frankston I 'd married bill in Frankston and we have lived in Frankston ever since I have been to Melbourne on shopping trips but that 's that 's about it you know I can think right back to when I was about 5 or 6 when the Frankston Beach was our backyard we played there all the time we would be down there until my mother had a cowbell and she used to ring it and a half a Frankston went home for tea I 'd hear her cowbell where I was living it was off Beach Street Frankston and the roads were not made of course there they were just sort of sandy tracks and all the children of to adventure some seven you know we all went out together I went to Davie Street school one for six four and we just loved it there but it was a long way away from East Frankston but later on when when we did have a bus service it was an initiative of our couple Gil and his wife Alice panting she was the bus driver so that was something all the ladies going to be a bus driver so we enjoyed that sometimes we deliberately not touch the bus we 'd walk home because we 'd walk can be behind the road roller you know we 're doing the roads and that was exciting it was something we didn 't have to pay for entertainment we just walked home we find something like that when I used to go to state school here at Frankston and Davey Street one four six four I used to walk different ways sometimes I 'd go up past the Grand Hotel and turn left and go and other times I 'd go into Thompson Street but she was very wet and muddy and hall on the right and we 'd cross him to plain Street and then we 'd go up where out this dairy were they had a there with the horses and we 'd go through the paddock and we 'd go over to school that way we found all sorts of interesting ways to get to school and to come home I used to time my going to school in sometimes not all the time but when they turned the engines around to face the other way which was quite interesting they their steam engine guys used to let out up quite a bit of steam at the finish and sometimes I was even late to school get my grandmother 's place during the war we all gathered around together to listen to their wireless I remember as a child they were talking about the guerrilla warfare and as a child also oh isn 't that terrible all these big Apes fighting together I didn 't know there was a different meaning for a guerilla warfare with our school we had to have at certain times when the siren went down in beauty Park practice runs and there you know we all got bitten by bullets everybody had to be had had they windows blacked out the air raid Borden came around and he 's tin hat and inspected and if you had a small of light he 'd knock on the door and get that fixed well the Marines lived at the balcony and they used to come in and we used to have the shop there 's only about three or four and I 'm sitting at the counter on a stool and this marine said something to me and he on 20 minute he said I 'm pulling your leg and I looked down to see if my leg was being pulled it was how innocent huh what 's at 00 before I went down the peninsula where the Americans were but the girlfriend one day we 'd walked right down to the beach and after all she said I think there 's something wrong so we got up and we 're very would practically run up the hill but oh thank God I sit out get out the bank it 's not said what 's the matter he said there 's an Indian seaman with smallpox and that 's the ambulance that he 's in and if he if he comes through and you 're on this side of the gate you 'll be here for a fortnight so we shot out the gate and when we came home I rang him up and I said what happened he said he had chickenpox not smallpox but there were so many Australian and English soldiers and sailors transported to Japan and in prisoner of war camps in Japan some prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines in Japan dad became terribly ill and he could see the Red Cross dropping crates of bully beef socks fruitcakes but more importantly than anything the letters from home and dad stood up to the Commandant one day and he quoted the rules of the Geneva Convention for the treatment of prisoners and he was beaten to the ground with bamboo poles and every time he felt of ground they propped him up and beat him to the ground were released to the prisoners of war and to get letters from home was magical and it it kept them saying dad discovered in amongst these crates of goodies that there was yellow sulfur drugs but tropical Elsa 's and there was Quinn in for malaria all tropical diseases and there was a strange white powder and he didn 't know what it was but he found it more efficient on the tropical ulcers than the sulfur drugs so he used it when he got home he discovered its name was penicillin and it had not been named before he went to war I mean we didn 't see our Father for another six and a half years I didn 't know my father until I was seven a lot of our soldiers went there to rehabilitate and they came home and many came home to Frankston with Japanese war brides and he treated them for free he held no grudge against the Japanese he said it was a dirty war that the fall of rebel on the island of New Britain he didn 't flee he stayed with his through the jungle and he walked towards what he knew was there at Misawa a Catholic mission and the Catholic missionary there wrote up about this huge man dragging Hitler wounded some hanging onto his belt and others under each one under each arm through the jungle and who refused even a cup of tea until his men were settled that 's what he was like and he was still like that many came back here and he worked for the community all his life it was graff and grumpy he was awkward socially but he was decent and he was a bloody good doctor it wasn 't really until you know after World War two that it started to take off more and that was because the government had a housing for returned servicemen ker Engel was opened up before that it was sort of farmland everything had to be new and everything had to be recovered from after the war when Central Park was Central Park it was it was really nice it was just paddock with the law with the library in one of the corners that edge right in the middle of it our biggest treat was to stop and watch the blacksmith Arthur 's dairies are still delivering milk by horse and cart and used to shoe the horses but it used to be a carbon Co way stop for going down down to support see yeah I remember seeing growing because I knocked him over one day didn 't mean to but there 's a little silly a place in wall street where the dentist is upstairs and you come down a flight of stairs and there 's the doorway and you step straight out onto the pavement and I 'd left my baby in the back of a car and I knew bill has gone off to look at something and I thought oh she might be hailing a head off so I run down the stairs jumped out and knock Graham Kennedy over I don 't say he fell full length but he did a sort of him a dance across the foot purple ended up and look at and we sold our shop and calls came it brought more trade down was quiet we 'd go down to the beach I would go to the well Street Beach whereas other people went to other beaches some of the winter they called the Long Island Beach and others would go to the fernery beach was opposite the fern area where there is their Celtx garage there was the fernery and it was also a boardinghouse and it was run by I think there were two sisters and it was very very popular and it was very genteel and ladylike in this particular died about six of us holed into this shop a couple of doors down from the ground to get a hamburger and at the end of the end of the shop there was a man stood there in an overcoat in the trilby hat he turned around to walk out and we all went mouths dropped open and it was Harold Holt but we used to see Dame Elizabeth a lot brown shopping around from some Dame Elisabeth Murdoch she would Park her car and knows I 'd be parking my car on the top and fallen Welsh 's she I 've always loved living in Frankston and now I 've never wanted to move anywhere else and I think a lot of the older people feel like that I had I hope I get carried out of my home with my boots on I don 't know I don 't ever want to leave here and yes I 'm very happy to be a Frankston arch yeah it 's what you make it I met someone who was applying for a Franklin City Council job he was in a business suit he was walking along the boardwalk and he was leaning over the edge of the railing and looking up at Oliver 's hill and down backwards towards North Frank 's than that way and I spoke to her and I said oh what is he he said I can 't believe it you 've kept it such a secret it 's a magnificent place and that 's just I agreed with him [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] _"

    "text": "[Music] you [Applause] hello my name is michael pepper georgia I 'm the manager planning environment here at Franklin City Council and my work environment is the lovely city of Frankston and everything in it I grew up in country Victoria but when I did visit my relatives in Oakley in Melbourne I do recall coming down to Frankston for a picnic by the beach we drove down we found a shady spot and we really enjoyed the day here and so I have fond memories of Frankston as a holiday destination which many people have the people of my age we have I 've been at Frankston for four years now so it 's not a long time but I 've certainly discovered that bring stone has lots of different areas with their own special character and some of that actually comes out in our work here in the planning department at Frankston where we 're looking at new development but we always have to be conscious of the history of the city and how we got here when people think about heritage they often ask whether a building they 're referring to state level objects of heritage value and there 's something called the state Heritage Register but people should also be aware that we can have local heritage items locations and sites and these are found in me heritage overlay and the schedule for the Heritage overlay in the Franklin planning scheme so it 's a good place to start your research if you 're interested in local history so you can list in the schedule to the Heritage overlay buildings which you might expect heritage buildings homesteads important public and civic buildings but you can also lose structures so for example we have got the gate posts to Frankston Park listed in our schedule to the Heritage overlay because they 're considered to be important memorials from France 's history and it can also be the actual land itself so a garden or the site where something happened can also be included in a list and why are they listed it 's so that when someone is proposing a change to that building or that site the actual values of the Heritage Place can be considered occur so it doesn 't mean that you can 't_''_182.7 do any extensions or changes to a listed building but those changes have to be designed and constructed in a way that won 't detract from the Heritage values okay well people might be surprised to learn that we have over seventy one listed places in the schedule to our heritage overlay in the Franklin planning scheme you can jump online look up Frankston planning scheme online you can go to Klaus 4301 which is our heritage overlay and you can actually read down the list of those 70 plus locations that are considered to have some heritage value or interest in terms of Frank 's turns history what sort of places are on that list it would be no surprise for most people that grand houses such as farm Mulberry Hill and Bell Park homestead important items on that list but there 's lots and lots of ordinary houses or what people might think of ordinary houses so we 've actually got places a lot of modernist 1950s houses in girl 's way and in the Amala Drive that are considered to be pioneers in terms of modern architecture in the Melbourne context so they 're almost like the hidden gems that complement the more civic buildings such as churches and council facilities that are listed but are also considered to be important okay the register in the planning scheme can be amended and we do from time to time add more items to the register because things are getting older all the time and turning to heritage items so as we found with modernist buildings of the 19th and 20th centuries so how do you get something listed when Council is preparing an amendment to the scheme it is able to consider new inclusions in any part of the scheme and that might include places to be added to the Heritage overlay when we do a study such as we did a few years ago looking at house design with in Frankston and looking at the remaining examples from prominent architects and styles of the previous century we actually called for people to nominate buildings and sites that should be included in that study and as a result the heritage overlay schedule okay I think the variety of items that are included in Franklin 's heritage very very rewarding so we do have the grand mansions like Cruden farm and its garden setting is very very important but we also have hidden history such as Lange Lauren Nature Reserve which has got relics from the world war two and we 'll cool one in terms of it being used as a camp and training area and also as a hospital I think for during the the war period so there 's hidden elements of history that can be discovered in all the Franks and suburbs and they can be reflected and found from our Heritage Register in terms of getting something listed in Frankston planning scheme Council amends its planning scam from time to time and is able then to add properties to the schedule to the Heritage overlay when we 've done a major study or investigation such as our mid-century housing survey that was done a few years ago we are able to investigate potential heritage properties that should be included on the list and at properties that could be included once they 've been investigated and they 're considered to have value then we create a amendment to the planning scheme and go through the formal process that of course that involves informing the owners and seeking submissions as to whether or not those properties should be included on the list and if it 's successful and the amendment is adopted we then had those properties to our schedule as a result of that 20th century modern housing study we added some 17 properties on to the Frankston planning scheme heritage overlay my name is Sally miles I work at the Frankston library and my job title is collections librarian I 've been doing my job now for about 15 years and what I do is I look at what the collection needs and buy books in and DVDs and whatever else that we have newspapers magazines etc for the library and then of course because we don 't have so much shops base we go booking it in double down so we have to look at what becomes obsolete and then with a collection we have newspapers we have maps books photographs memorabilia all sorts of different things because it 's all about keeping track of history and what 's going on in the area and so we like to keep it if we possibly can in the libraries of a laboratory at Princeton we have a history room we have process like you can see behind me we have display cabinets that all have photos and books and things in there and we also have a website at the end of March you 'll be able to get onto our website and look up digital replications of photos from the area and search through those and you 're actually able to look at photos on website I find that the really interesting things are the local people 's histories that we 've got what if you sort of been once and they fascinate you things that you find that people do just not something some instances not at all and like what we do today and in other instances so much slower form of life than you 're thinking so there 's that we were really thrilled to get which was a [Music] personal photographs taken on the set of the 1959 on the beach with Gregory Peck and our governor and Fred Astaire and they 've just got set photos and so they donated this album and it 's just amazing you know the less casual shots that just don 't exist anyway but we grow these things are quite precious so we do have them as they used in the library only a lot of the photos as long as we 've been able to get them released you don 't legally we can people can have I think I think they can get copies of them but yeah they 're definitely able to have a look at them in the library we have a lot of in the 80s the staff did a lot of interviewing of locals and we have oral histories and they 're they 're fascinating because that 's you know day to day lives and they 're in two formats beginning people can listen to them and they 've actually been transcribed into a book so 't realize about that sorry that 's why I was really interested too one of the things that that I find pretty interesting is that the history of the newspapers because they have a newspaper collection does go back into the 1800s just for advertising so in the 20s there were home remedies in abundance you know like the suggestions of things that you have so you know if you were feeling that you wanted to lose weight you know then swallow a tapeworm which isn 't actually advice nowadays there 's also things like it didn 't matter what the article was in 80s or 70s there was a scantily clad when some way beside it so it 's like Britney Apple so they 're you know like they 're some of the things that are really interesting but probably the only Beach of them is is the thing that we 've sort of looked at when somebody was doing on anyway prettiest place like that okay to access the archives you would a patron would come to the library and they would then or email make an email the staff the staff would then put their request on to Sally and then then be able to contact them directly or email them back and just confirm exactly what they want when they wanted by how they could come in and have a look at it or if it was something that we could give them copies of or how they can access it so that would be their the easiest way of getting an access to their archives we would accept it correctly if they could bring in anything that they hadn 't thought that they would like to donate to the library they can just drop it off at the desk or if they wanted to contact the library through phone or email saying that they you know make an appointment with Sally or anything like that we do get an awful lot of things like newspapers and things which is terrific just donated and we love it and but anything that we can get is really helpful and it just keeps it keeps the archives fresh and complete or as complete as we can get and 's available for anybody who wants to use it I lived in Cranbourne when it was a little tiny country town and you either had to go to Daddy not to go shopping or you had to go to Princeton and generally we would counter Frankston to do the shopping and that was when the library was in the central carpark and there was not undercover and you know there were shops or anything as well sorry yeah it was familiar with Frankston were practically all alive this has got a sound so daddy but going to the Frankston library when it was in the central car park and just rummaging through the it was I think it was the junior fiction and just being amazed that there was an entire series I think it might have been an enum blyton series and they had everything and I thought business versus [Music] my name 's Carol Pico I work at impact volunteering and I have established the Princeton history facebook page the pages existed for three years and we have 2600 members it started off as a purely personal interest Frankston Pappas sort of history open to the bosom in history group they were just you know you 're from Frankston we hosted a couple of pictures and they would get removed and I thought well why isn 't there you know and I knew there was a lost Melbourne lost Dandenong and I looked at her Frankston won there wasn 't one and I thought well no other way to for me to continue to learn about the history and social media especially Facebook could seem like the perfect marriage it 's not everybody has access to just to searching for you know information and then it went on to the community because I thought you know there 's probably people with things that they 've collected over the years because it 's part of their history and I approve posts and they can share anything they 've got that they have really personal it 's sort of family photos and yeah memories and I guess people then go on to sort of share their memories and a lot of people have reconnected they haven 't spoken they reconnect the grandchild learning through the mother who 's also on the page about their grandfather 's business so you know it 's pretty amazing it 's you know allowing younger generations to connect this standout at the moment Alfonso 's book Willy 's taken before and then and now photos and put them together it 's so varied it 's got such so many notable people and more sites from I love hearing the everyday persons we 've got you 've got your formal history and all but I think it 's the everyday person and just the the so many entrepreneurs and big thinkers and they had vision and they obviously loved the place and connected and yeah and I think that reflects to you now when you 've read about all these people and yeah Frankston house holds fascination and Mark Brody I would love to sort of find out everything and anything about my Brody because of his postcards I think that 's what started this sort of you was this man and he was involved in so many things well an entrepreneur really I really wanted for me postcards or something ticketing it birth a time gone and see so much it 's not much known about him not very prominent biggie-d he did a lot if somebody wanted to join our group they would just send us a request if somebody who had material they wanted to share with us they would obviously photograph it or presented in whichever way send it to us it gets approved ood there 's a home page every now and then we get you know thank you so much you allowed me to go back to step back in time for my time I 've moved away now and yes I think I said earlier that history 's usually written or remembered while you 're notable people and I think the Franks Turner history page allows the everyday person to to be part of that history because at the end of the day it 's all connected not just all the people that are doing great things we 're all doing great things the page allows people to be part of that especially if they 're nobody in the is sort of having established the social media sees any people to to go through their photo albums and get those photos scan get them saved so that they 're out there for instead of sitting in a private photo album and maybe being disposed of because it may not be important to the next generation but there 's a group of people 2,000 of us that love to see stuff interested in history in general and I want to know where I 'm where I am so obviously living within the area to find out more it may be insignificant to someone you know you could just be at one photo in an album that 's insignificant to somebody but to us [Music] you _"

in relation to that recommendation unfortunately the weather was against us when we endeavoured to simulate the height of the sign but fortunately we taken some video which has been submitted to the council as a result of a trial flight that we had made previously that confirmed the assessment that we 've previously made that 25 meters is the height of the sign is required to achieve its purpose of endeavouring to identify the center from Peninsula link and to attract business from beyond Frankston boundaries from the elongated north-south catchment that peninsula link provides to the center I won 't go over old ground but I 'd simply draw like to draw council 's attention to several aspects of the report that 's before you firstly I think it is significant and that the officers support the officers saw independent urban design advice in relation to the sign and the bad advice the sign was considered appropriate I think it 's also significant that the officers find and and and and our submissions included that the sign is supported not only by the council 's advertising code but also policy for advertising signs adjacent to freeways contained within the planning scheme and I think that is a significant issue finally I 'd also like to draw councillors attention to the perceived but or the potential amenity impacts that the sign might have had on sensitive areas around the site and put simply put the separation distances the changes in the topography of the of the general area we believe mean and I think the report indicates that those effects would be negligible in terms of the operation of the sign both at day and at night I 'd also like to indicate that the further development of the site and in particular the application that 's currently been lodged with Council for the stage one expansion will further limit sight lines from those sensitive interfaces to the signs location thank you very much chrome obviously I 've got a council this hand comment that the impact of the sign in terms of local or in nearby amenity is negative negligible negligible yes they made their comment that 's our system how do you how do you assess that to be when it 's about 80 feet high in responding to council offices further information requests we actually modelled the height of the sign from what we regarded as the typical view points from the sensitive interfaces and those are the residential properties that above the site to the north the residential properties to the east on the other side of McClellan Drive and the residential properties to the south of Cranbourne Road we modelled the views to the sign from each of those locations and found that not only other views distant but in fact the views are largely glimpses of the sign due to intervening structures and the topography the intervening topography simply put we don 't believe that there are significant views to the sign from those adjacent residential areas which are between 450 and 200 meters separate separated from the site of the sign I think thank you a any questions of crime if not thank you very much Graham thank you okay I 'd like to call on a mr. Robert Allsup and he was making an submission on three McLean Court Frankston SAS Robert as per other people I 'll give you a ring on the Bell for 20 seconds to go so allow you to wind up thank you press your button so I can hear good evening mayor mayor and councillors thank you for letting me speak tonight my name is Robert Allsup myself my family lived at 3 McLean Court Frank 's himself we have lived at the suggester 12 since the 12th of February 2016 we bought this area bought in this area due to have been a perfect house to feed our family and there is existing sheds in the area with that we could do the same to accommodate our cars as you are aware I 've put in application to construct three structures of a garage a shed in alfresco which have been recommended to grant a permit by the Franks and planning officers I have I have been a could drive as a young child over the years I 've collected a few cars where I 've spent a lot of my time and money on which I enjoy with no shared garage these cars are deteriorating in the elements such as mice rats spiders ants nests heat rain dust hail falling branches and much more the extent of damage ranges from scratches rust interior going mouldy sagging head sagging falling headlining color fading went 18 peeling plastic parts cracking and whopping just to name a few I have six children four which have licenses they have supported me they have supported and being involved in my passion and know him point these cars they 're to me my dream would be to pass these vehicles on to my children needs to come but I 'm going to to to all to enjoy them and continue my passion the main concern were the objectors but why the objectors are with the shed which surprised me as most neighbors in our neighborhood neighbouring area to have large shades and garages we are concerned with noise smell etc associated with being case I 'm not a mechanic and never have been one wall mechanical repairs are conducted by a qualified mechanic at a proper off-site workshops the remediation meeting we had I listened to the objectors in clearly understood their concerns I wish no ill feelings between me my family with their neighbors and have no hidden agendas with these three structures on saying this I have offered and agreed to lower the heart of the roof which was another concern so it 's no longer a barn style but a normal gable roof I have agreed in the clause that no tools will be housed in this shed to conducting these sort of mechanical repairs most would be an uproar to agree with the with these clause as majority you have sheds stool tools etc in their sheds but as you can see I am very concerned with the deterioration is safety of my vehicles and have agreed with this these clauses not only for me but for anyone at this address for the lifetime of the property the lengthy process to obtain a permit of nearly two years have only but to my wife my children family and friends me and counselors please take my application with much consideration as this is a very important to me in my family thank you very much Rowlett we have questions Robert for you from councillor Tom 's hi Robert how are you thank you welcome the the thing that I would like to ask you a lot of your fellow neighbors are concerned that the shed the barn will be used for commercial practices now your you 've assured us just now would you be happy if a condition be placed on the permit to restrict it for domestic citizens only yes just because that that allows that allows for sorry counselor okay okay that 's okay that 's alright so you 'd be happy for that to you just somebody comes so my car 's gonna be safe I 'm not going to be working on just let 's understand just a storage yeah okay all right thank you Thank You counselor as any other castles got any questions cache awakened so what you 're saying is you want a are not stored correct okay and you 're saying that what are the shared might be used for any other no activity or purpose no are you you 're also saying that you won 't carry out any repairs or panel beating or an spray-painting or anything of like that I think on those vehicles in that show I have I have people do that for me and you and that would be off-site correct and you understand that in the with the permit conditions as they 'll I doubt that that was all taken into your hands yes I do all taken into account you do understand that that you could be subject to sudden visitation by an officer of counsel if there was any concern if there was any concern that had been expressed by anyone locally as to anything going on there that 's contrary and you understand all okay thank you thank you can excellent any other cancers are any questions if not Robert thank you very much thank you okay I like to call on Peter mills to give a submission on the same three I 'll let you know 20 seconds before you have three minutes is up I 'll ring the bell Thank You Man good evening everyone we have nothing against Bob but there 's eight objections been put in for this place and these things that people need to realize when they do make a decision first of all God did move in with his family that used to be a lovely Bush block with many trees and vegetation since Rob 's moved in all those trees have been cleared and the land where he wants his barn shed which is a big barn that should be on three acres not in the 2500 meter square property and thanks himself it was cleared it was leveled well you have proof where he 's actually advertised of earth-moving equipment a backhoe to come in and do that so he could put a concrete foundation there he has extended the gravel driveway by cleaning more vegetation to our property we 're at the back of him and the driveway snakes around our fence where we 'll go into this barn with three doors property at number two Ksenia we have concerns there with lights and noise we already hear his cars we don 't know how many cars he 's God we had a meeting with the planners and they could not tell us how many cars he did actually have he assured us that he doesn 't drive a lot of them we know that he does place at least one of them and we have observed him driving around the neighborhood in these cars he 's a shift worker so he uses his cars at different times of the night not only have these trees been cleared but he also wants to put on our first guy on this property which is going to be right next to this barn share this big barn shed it 's not going to be near his property once again it 's going to be the back near the back fence of the neighbors where all the noise is going to be I asked the question why would you put an alfresco linked to a barn shed unless you 're looking at entertaining while you people around just observing the cars it doesn 't make any sense when you 've got a pool area and a balcony the three things that he 's proposing the garage we don 't have an issue with that we 're happy because that is the size of the other sheds in the neighborhood the big barn one where he wants to put all these classical cars it 's a big it 's a big bunch if it 's anyway can describe it there 's nothing in a neighborhood like that and he 's going to put that where he 's actually played the trees and leveled everything so we have great concerns with that there 's no consideration for that for the neighbors it 's one man 's hobby that 's upsetting the rest of the neighborhood it doesn 't benefit anyone except for Rob and we just encourage you to really just if you can please just to reject this because there 's a lot of people not happy just quickly Amanda and Dan and David over here I stood on their back step yesterday this barn is they look out their back window they had bush and trees and vegetation there when the or sobs moved in that he 's gone there so thank you for listening to it okay Peter thank you very much that before you get up I 've got some castles got questions got counselor Tom Shannon councillor akin Lancaster rum yo hey going I could thank you Peter the question is when do you allege that the vegetation was removed you 've just said that it 's been removed by the current occupants who wish to further develop the site I 've got some site images here of various stages of that property and when there was vegetation when there wasn 't when do you allege do you allege yeah when the place was purchased I 'm in February of 2016 and it would have been in the few months after that it 's been a gradual process we observed tree lovers that came on and the neighbors did see that and there was on social media he actually advertised for men moving equipment back oh so he would clear land as constantly for two years but there was one time when a lot of trees were cleared now we could not see Amanda and David 's because of all the trees we can clearly see their property now I 've got photos of fur but before we can even know their place was there we could not say it okay thank you can I go kostik actually akin and then I come back to you I have to counselor run junior cash vacant do you want to it 's very hard for us here to not to make a decision I think on this because we 've got two very different sides of an issue and I personally am having a bit of trouble with this one so there 's cars on on location there 's a lot of cars yeah it 's not a car yard no do you we do the neighbors have woken up yep they 've always said they 've heard these cars idling at nighttime yep what times for instance waking up you live in a clock we 've got a lot of people that couldn light night that 's all right so and I guess it 's fair to say that any car can idle in any suburban location anywhere in Frankston so what what is not being provocative I 'm just asking what is the difference yeah the difference here he said if you have a look at the plan there which to come and get the plan up is there any chance of no as you can see from here and if you 've got a barn shed I mean this is the barn that we 're talking about it 's three doors now normally if you 're going to have a shared you 'd have it facing to the front of the property the driveway has been extended to the rear of the property snakes around the back fence and then it turns around on a 180-degree turn so the pastrami 's cars will drive his cars into the three doors those three doors there those three doors are facing our property not the front of the place not his place towards our place these cars are going to drive straight down noise and then he 's going to turn and Park all his cars in he shed and that he 's facing directly towards our back property like I said the other garage that he wants we don 't have an issue with that and we have to realize all of these three are outside the building emboli agreement 173 none of them are within the building about they 're all outside okay thank you Peter you are actually getting into debate here yeah okay I can 't slack you know thanks very much mr. Muir I 'm paid oh yeah anybody couldn 't thanks but I just had a quick question for you you indicated in your submission that this proposed barn style shed was going to be 20 meters away from one of the neighbors back windows and I 'm just trying to work out how that can be well I 've got a photo I got a photo and honestly I mean I 've sent it to some of the counselors I think and you would be disgusted if you saw and cancel the Tom 's is saying 'm just asking where you 've got the 20 meters from because I 'm looking at this document here which shows the shed think about that looks like about 30 metres from the property boundary which would mean on the other side of the property boundary that the property that you say is 20 meters away it would need to be within 7 meters I 'm just asking for clarification that 's all yeah sorry yeah I can 't enter debate okay yeah that 's for McLean 9 cord and which is a man doing David 's and so that would be the back of the sun-god shed yeah thank you I thought it was okay cash so Tom 's you had another question yes thank you mr. mayor my question was are you aware that the applicant has reduced the heart of the barn about the size of this door to the chamber here from from that height to lowering it so that it 's not going to be as high well we are aware of that yes but it 's it 's still a barn shared and it not towards his property but facing towards us all these cars if he has his doors I 've been doing anything all that noise lights pollution whatever come straight out onto our property and the property of number 2 Ksenia and at the end of the day that vegetation was cleared Google Earth shows that it was cleared yeah okay the second question mr. Maron the questions to mr. pappagiorgio and the question okay you can 't_''_1998.71 I can 't right now in debate that 's fine okay Peter thank you very much for that Thank You cancellous okay now I call on in McNeal on the same matter three McLean Court Frankston South Oh weaken if you 're speaking on behalf mu can you 've got three minutes and I will be letting you know twenty seconds before time stop talking it took me four minutes so should I read really fast you need you need you will only have three minutes okay I 'm reading on behalf of the MacNeil family because both of our REO properties join whether bond said is my wife Susan and I are are worried that the noise and lack of privacy from the proposed six carbon shed and adjacent alfresco area will impact on our tranquil property the area has already been cleared by current owner the current owners which they deny and now their argument is that this area has been cleared therefore therefore they shall be allowed to develop it how can this be the case they will find for removing trees and excavating outside of their building envelope and now their proposal says that there is no environmental impact there has already been significant environmental impact and I believe the course of action should be that the council mandate the restoration of the treat area and to not allow them to turn it into a completely and outrageously oversized development which is way out of character with this part of Frankston South we pay a lot of money to live in this area both in property prices and council rates and it is a reasonable expectation that bylaws exist to maintain the area and that the council will uphold them we previously felt that the Frankston council rigorously defends around tree removal particularly outside of defined building envelopes but the Town Planning Department decision to recommend this proposal seems to contradict of all of its own rules what is council 's new position on tree removal and neighbourhood character if it has changed from what it is published on your website by allowing this proposal it will set a very dangerous precedent that is developments like this are not allowed when there are trees in the way but it 's okay to illegally remove the trees and then get the green light to proceed the private Town Planner employed by the owners of three McLean Court have compared to neighboring sheds and properties to the three McLean Court proposal however there are clear errors with what they have presented some weren 't even sheds also they failed to acknowledge one major factor three McLean Court are wanting three outbuildings all outside the current already once extended building envelope please refer to any other aerial photograph and note that not one other property in the area has more than one outbuilding this is so far beyond the 100 metres squared rejected from our point of view we don 't have an issue with the proposed double garage up near the house our issue is with the alfresco and the barn shed both mainly from a noise and privacy point of view as detailed in our original objection the only purpose that we can see for an alfresco area for more than 15 metres from the main residence but adjacent to the barn is for the owners to hold noisy parties while working on cars which they even admit to in the original proposal as it stands we often hear the owner for McLean Court starting and extensively idling his loud cars sometimes during the night due to his shift work we would be happy if the whole proposal is reduced to a single outbuilding in line with all the other houses in the area but would be happy for this to be increased to a fourth size okay thank you very much before we go any further we need hit your name and Amanda Grylls Amanda Grylls yes Amanda your speaking on behalf of some when someone wants to ask answer on behalf of somebody else if you 're speaking after this and you are I 'll let the counselors ask you questions direct well we 've got you down as a next speaker yes I was going to read this McNeal isn 't able to come tonight oh okay he asked me to read this on his behalf and I said well mine 's pretty much the same rather than doubling up am I able to just read this one well I was going to give you time to read you to do your own submission yeah well you my own time well you can get you 're down to be speaking Amanda so you 'll have an opportunity to speak on your behalf okay okay you 've now got three minutes okay as I was saying we would be happy if the whole proposal was reduced to a single hour building in line with all the other houses in the area but would be happy for this to be increased in size to a four car garage up near the house facing McLean Court it appears from plain house four cars if the proposal was modified as such we 'll be happy for that as long as they will force to remove the new gravel driveway along our fence line and the large gravel cleared area which is where outside the building envelope both of which they have already constructed illegally okay now that I 've got some time I can also say that my house was the one that Peter was talking about at number four McLean Court and so while we 're not in the master room just yet that 's our proposed master room and I 'd say to be less than 20 metres away from the barn shed and when we built our house we had a strict building envelope so we weren 't able to put our doors out where we wanted them so our doors opened out to the side and so we 've designed our area around that and now when we open our big glass doors we will just see the wall of the shed the new the back wall of the proposed shed which is it 's just gonna house Doris Kirschner Tom 's you have an opportunity Thank You mr. Muir it was me who encouraged you to read for that your neighbor this evening and I 've been approached by various neighbors and I would have to say I agree with counsel writing this is very difficult and I am inclined to move it deferral of this matter would the neighbors be counselors down counselor you 're not allowed to ant answer you 've got to ask a question education that wasn 't that wasn 't a question would you agreeable to a deferral that 's the question mr. mayor that 's what I 'm saying no you can 't speak just answer the question Amanda will you please yes as long as we 're able to have a meeting thanks very much that 's like any other councillors got questions of Amanda I think you 've put I think you put your objections and mr. McNeill 's very well Amanda thanks very much for that thank you just ask that when we 're thinking of this can you please I think whilst Rob may not do he 's not going to do that 's fine but what if he sells in two years you 've had enough time thank you thank you very much I 'd like to call on Roland Abraham 's on behalf of southern planning consultants this is to do with 21 Edward Street Lane Warren you have three minutes Roland I 'll let you know 15 seconds before your time 's up I think you mr. Marion good evening councillors look I appear on behalf of the applicant in this proposal but one of the concerns I have is that I do support the officers report in its in its completion however there are some concerns that I need to draw councillors attention to and if I can guide councillors to page 237 of the agenda item and in particular condition 1c e F and G now the concerns we have as the consultant for the applicant is that the particular retention of the tree has been recommended by the council officers however there is an arborist report that recommends removal and that certainly affects the the proposal as its entirety there as you can see from the plans which you have before you that runs diagonally across which would affect that site the fact that there is a tree there that certainly affects the easement moving forward there is a report as I reiterate that that has been provided by qualified arborist that suggests removal I would be mindful if if council is of the view that if the tree wants to be removed we would be proposing that we would be prepared to provide another tree in its replacement given that that tree will be removed but obviously when you consider the condition 1 C and E that certainly affects the central driveway and the visitors car space which is something we want to make sure we retain given that formed part of councils policy in the past further to that we 've got F and G which again is condition one there is a setback of 1.2 meters minimum from the shared boundary now as councillors may be all aware the is obviously a number of developments around the city of Frankston where these particular setbacks are shared and or as I would suggest that the the proposal that we 're putting forward before the chamber is that this particular development there would be a fence going right through so you wouldn 't get a wall of brick it would be a fence and then you 'd have the garage with a slight setback so we are doers Council is to consider the deletion of if in relation to G which is residents free which is to the the farm north or northwest of the proposal any suggestion of a reduction of 500 millimeters now that may seem very minuscule in the scheme of things but the actual bedrooms in their sizes are sitting in the vicinity of just in excess of 3 meters so any consideration of that would look at potentially exceeding onto the garage which would certainly provide a sheer wall which is certainly not in the favor of planning offices thank you thank you have I got any counselors with any question coach the mayor yep hi we received an email I wasn 't able to attend the residents meeting and I apologized to the the three two storey buildings be relocated to the front of the property you know that you know it was there was a feeling that that wasn 't really taken seriously and I 'm just wondering if that would be possible councillor mayor I can assure you that all consideration was taken into account in relation to redesigning the problem we have is we 've got a an easement that runs through the site and obviously with easements there are certain guidelines that need to be met that we need to follow procedurally and that 's from Melbourne water and obviously from a town planning perspective this is probably the best layout that we 've come up with where we 're certainly not suggesting that we want to make this an overdeveloped site this is a site that has made sure that it complied with town planning guidelines and that is certainly clear by the officers recommendation and as I said earlier my submission the the changes that I 'm requesting are very slight it certainly adheres to the entirety of the report with the exception of those four conditions Robert one more question then go to Glen castle Glen Aiken and then to counsel and Brian Cunha so if you 're looking at replacing I 'm just wondering is the footprint different for the front ones than it is for the back ones because you don 't build over an easement anyway so the other ones at the front would not be over an easement anyway so that 's not a reason not to build them not to put them there that 's not a good argument and easement is an easement you don 't need open easement you need a question Joshua that is a question I 'm just saying well I I don 't really feel that my questions been answered because if you 're building on the same footprint but you 're changing it from a two-story to calorie you can 't look I understand what you 're saying isn 't that a reason well you need to bring this up under discussion when it comes up he obviously hasn 't answered your question so you need to to debate this okay okay sir Aiken you I am counselor that is correct good I would have thought it was reasonable to give consideration to their requests insofar as looking at the site in a malleable way a flexible way plasticine why counselor you need to ask a direct question what I am asking this no you 're not counselor you 're not asking a direct question while I can 't answer it no and ask a direct question in a way which is direct not going in to debate ask the correct the question directly to and I will be why haven 't you been able to come up with a concept that reasonably satisfies the concerns of residents given that it 's the same parcel of land why can it truly not be reconfigured councillor to answer that question again I the same response I gave to your fellow colleague the the design has met all the town planning regulations its met all the requirements with ensure that design does reflect the concerns of the rest of the residents and in relation to things such as bulking visual massing all of those issues have been reflective in the officers report which highlights those issues were also ensured that we 've added a visitor 's carpark which addresses those issues of traffic which has been a concern by the residents which would again in the previous application that we had lodged that was not there and we 've ensured we 've added that on there to make sure that the the reduction of traffic will take into account if there are people visiting the site then it will take that into account we also ensure that there 'll be tree plantations that will be taking place which is a condition of the permit which is also in there in the report by that by the council offices so you 've just said that you 've answered the concerns of the residents we have answered the concerns of the residents accordingly and fairly but make sure that and we make sorry counselling with due respect if I may but also ensuring that we also take into account that it is compliant with the planning provisions and planning controls you 're finished yes I am Council good so 't answer that it 's like with any we talk with any particular application you 'll get counselor you 'll get actual residents who will object as but as per the previous application it 's before your chamber to be decided on you will get counselor get counselors will need to be making a decision followed by the residents will make their submissions followed by the applicant in which I 'm acting on their behalf so are you actually saying that there is no way known that the building 's design or the layout of the buildings on that site there 's no way known it can be reconfigured no way known is that what you say no Council he putting words into well I 'm answering the question that 's not correct you 're giving me hypotheticals you 're expecting me well can I just butt in here sure he 's asking he 's actually asking you a direct question sure and I 'd like you to answer it directly if you wouldn 't mind I 'm happy to answer the question but the facts of the matter is to take into account the planning controls and we 've made sure that we have taken into account the residents concerns there are conditions here which take into account as you said counselor with respect to and if you have read the documentation which I 'm sure you have taking into account things such as overlooking things such as visual bulk and we 've made sure we 've taken that into account given the counts okay I think I think he 's gone random I think I don 't need to ask any further I don 't think you need to councillor Cunha thanks very much mr. mee all right why are you canceling hi good thanks good I 'm just during your submission you requested the council consider removing part one see any of the officers recommendations part one C refers to the retention of tree number two which is an eucalyptus Elijah and e1e talks about the reconfiguration of the central driveway my question is I haven 't seen the tree but there 's an aerial shot on page 245 of the council 's report can you actually and just move the driveway and the parking visitor space councillor we have considered that option and I 've actually gone and seen that tree ideally it would be what it would be great if we could retain that tree but unfortunately the way it 's been designed it would create further problems only the only option we would have is to move the visitor space instead of it sitting on the eastern side it would move to the western side but obviously that would that would not in my opinion create a good development site because we 've now got a visitor 's car park that 's directly opposite resident one and so the reason why we 've put a permeable visitor space is to allow for any future trees if we would have put there so we 're asking for the tree to rumi be removed because that is what 's being recommended by the arborist this is not something that Roland you 're getting worse than the councillors you are getting worse than the castle she 's not being asked a question and then you start going if you get your asked a question please councillor Cunha any more questions no no mr. Smith thank you any councillors wish to add to the debate thank you very much rolling Thank You mr. Marin Thank You counsel okay miss Angela Glenn the same application 21 Edward Street Angela I you have the same direction as previous speakers you have three minutes and I shall let you know with the ring of the Bell when you 're twenty minutes twenty seconds to go Thank You mr. mayor councillors my name is Angela Glen and my husband Jeff and I live on a battle-axe property at the rear of number 21 Edward Street which is the development in question I haven 't spoken at a council meeting before and I 'm a bit nervous I hope you 'll excuse me if I get a bit flustered I 'll be speaking on behalf of Jeff and myself as well as the other three adjoining property owners after our neighborhood meetings we realized that basically we were all on the same page we all wanted the same sort of outcome so rather thought we limit our submissions to just a couple of us firstly I would like to say that we are not and never have been against opposed to the redevelopment of this site happy the original owner always talked about how you know he sell the property one day in make his millions and so it was no surprise to us when he finally did sell after the proposed application as far as the building and council requirements go I 'm sure that that this proposal takes most boxes however from our sides of the fence we don 't agree I know you 're all familiar with the site plans but not in relation to our neighboring properties so I 've drawn up a basic diagram for your consideration I 'm sorry it shows the impact of on all of us from the current current placement of the two-story dwelling so this is Gary and Marilyn at the front here this is Stephen Michelle this is my husband and I and this is our new neighbors Lauren and Dylan so you can see that the placement of these three double the height and the placement will dominate and invade our feeling of personal amenity due to their incredibly close proximity as well as creating what we all feel is an unacceptable visual bulk the building application states repeatedly and I quote the proposal will not unreasonably impact on the amenity of the surrounding neighborhood character as its siting and location has been carefully chosen to result in the least amount of impact on adjoining properties and I quote will not be visibly obtrusive or suffer from visual bulk well from our point of view they do and they will achieve exactly the opposite to those statements the two-story dwellings positioned as they are will be completely out of character for us adjoining neighbors they 'll result in us losing our natural and reasonable openness and personal amenity which is absolutely the key reason that we all chose to live there they haven 't seem to show any consideration or compromise when we talked about perhaps finding a solution and putting the two stories down the front in effect they wanted a hundred percent their way we are jointly asking or of consideration thank you to all of it your time 's up okay any questions from any of the counselors for first-time Angela you put it very very well thank you okay I call on our Michelle over white for the same proposal 21 Edward Street Lane Warren Thank You Man and counselors for allowing me to speak um yes Oh my husband oh I state now I live at number 23 everyth Street we are battle ax blocks so we are right down the block and the yeah two story development see the visual bog that will we get to look out outside our front door what is terrible it 's totally changing the environment of Lang Warren it 's always been known as Lee feeling whiners you know sort of becoming a concrete jungle yeah we get no say in the matter we 've lived there for over 20 years and all of a sudden developers come in make a quick buck and leave so and we get left for the concrete jungle this density you know should be left to central areas like as in Frankston main know I don 't think it 's sort of you know we don 't get much say in how the plantings done it 's just totally changing it and it 's just always being known as one of the best streets in lane one forever yeah that 's so you know has all the gum trees we don 't have footpaths we wanted to keep it natural that 's possible but now you know it 's time to get destroyed and that 's yeah we just feel we 're being overrun by high-density and the visual Bach and the shadows that overcast or come across to our property yeah so we feel that can will encroach by sort of some point nine meters where it 's gone by the formulas was calculated on 22nd of September so yeah that 's our personal space is being thank you very much you have got extra time but if you want to know okay we 'll get counselors a surfeit some questions cast or akin so you currently love where you live and you you feel that this is going to well how your lifestyle and and your outlook into the future yes it does already because the developments that have already started and has changed the character of our street completely and it 's just out of control like these little cars on the street and the road is not wide enough for parking on both sides anyway and now we 've got little schtick canes happening a little bump yeah Rollo this happening changing the whole aspect of the site it 's totally changed and how long have you lived there you say sorry we have lived there 22 years in that okay thank you low room sound of man hi Howie so I 'm just wondering from memory I think Colin and I have walked those streets a number of times that 's one of those ones that are really narrow with no footpath and you have to walk on the nature strip so it means that it makes it very difficult for someone with a pram I think we we actually had a resident who put in about three hundred complaints or something you know the problem because there um yeah so people have to park on the nature streets which means it 's very hard to walk around the cars just I was just asking is that one of those Street so it has no footpaths and he 's very narrow and yeah you said yes thank you no more questions okay well thank you very much Michelle you done well okay counselors now on to items brought forward there 's any items that council wish to bring forward that I wish to bring forward and that you have flagged an item people to do with the FDA in clothes council I would like that oh sorry brought into open council well you need a seconder to do that now that 's this is that 's a procedure wasn 't it okay that 's that 's a procedural motion and what we need to do is we need to take a vote on this so all in favor of bringing their item in close counsel out into oak open counsel please show your hands councillor akin councillor bollam councillor Tom 's councillor run McCormick those against okay so Councillor Michael O 'Reilly that 's lost okay any other items brought forward mr. Muir I was going to suggest that we bring forward all those items that we 've had submitters on but it looks like items 11 1 2 3 4 are the ones that in question so there 's probably no real need I think we 're also we have item 13 point 2 which is a visitor information center we have some people in the gallery we go as per the schedule but to bring 13.2 forward I said okay with counselors okay yeah I know I 'll bring them forward so well we 're deal with thirteen point two first and then we 'll go through the agenda as it stands okay we 've gone to item number thirteen point two which is Oh before we go now before we go to that we 've got presentations and and awards and also petitions and joint letters so do I have any I know got a joint letter from cancer mr. mayor I 'd like to well I 'll let you know earlier that there would I 'll just read briefly the contents of it so that councils are aware of the gist of it and it relates to footpath and associated works in over port Road Frank 's and South it 's fairly lengthy but I 'll read the just the main parts of it we the undersigned residents wish to bring to your attention a recent notice to property owners or occupiers from Frankston City Council dated 23rd of March 2018 and there is a copy attached to the joint letter that approved works for the construction of a footpath between number 68 and number 86 on the western side of either port road are underway and due to be completed before the end of the font financial year additional works include site-specific alterations to curbs for ramp constructions and access ways to over port road and a median refuge stripping over port road within the vicinity of a CR SL care mr. Muir and as I said it 's quite lengthy the the crux of it if you like is that there are a number of residents there 's actually 37 signatories to told who aren 't able to sign well weren 't able to sign because are away for Easter and they 're opposed to the building of this footpath one of the main reasons it would appear to me is that because they were never asked whether they wanted a footpath or not as I indicated this joint letter suggests that there 's a number of quite a number of people opposed to the footpath and I would like to table this we 've had discussions earlier prior to this meeting and there 's been a agreement that work will stop now until residents are Lisa very Thank You councillor Knoll table that example okay tell that okay um councillors and ladies and gentlemen I have the great pleasure of actually warding a letter under seal to a long-serving member of this council his name is Michael Craighead who was set over to my left over here this letter under seal Franks and City Council expresses a sincere gratefulness and appreciation for your contribution and outstanding service to the city of Frankston for the number of 40 years like always been an achievement I think we should put our hands together in 1987 you commenced in the role of general administrative officer of the rates office and after two years you moved on to various appointments within the corporate services sector until 1995 when you were appointed to see governance services coordinator which you held for 10 years Michael I could go on with the different positions that you 've held in council you are highly regarded and respected leader within this organization and the wider community most people at council know you as the walking encyclopedia which you are due to your extensive knowledge about the municipal municipality you have always been supportive of your staff and people value your input advice and respect your honesty you are very forthright in what you say Michael and it 's a characteristic which is not often in people which you meet in the day you need a day a life you are forthright in what you say and you stick to it and I 'd like to say well done and congratulations and I 'd like to hand over to the chief him and staff thank you mr. Marin and council was this is a great pleasure that I speak on behalf of the organization at Franklin City Council on the achievement of Michael Craighead 40 years service and I do so on behalf of the staff that Michael would have started out with and over the passage of time people have come and gone new faces but Michael has remained a constant over 40 years when I talk to younger members of the staff in this day and age some people younger people both in organizations such as Frank stand then in life in general after about 40 minutes are looking for a new opportunity and I think it 's a testament to Michael 's character to his determination but more importantly I think his love of Frankston City Council and more importantly the disability that he serves that keeps Michael going and I 'd have to say I didn 't know Michael forty years ago but today he demonstrates the same level of enthusiasm day-in day-out yes he 's fearless and frank and his advice to counselors and to CEOs and I think that he has served the council and the community tremendously over the 40 years unfortunately he 's a Collingwood supporter but we won 't hold that against him he is a part of the fabric of the organization and an important part of the fabric people do look for him for it to him for advice but more importantly he 's a good friend to every individual staff member and Michael on behalf of staff past present and possibly into the future because she continued to serve this council I congratulate you I thank you and I say a job well done on behalf of the council in the community [Applause] it 's certainly a long time to belong to any organization especially especially a council oh good well done Michael okay we 're going on two items brought forward 13.2 I 'll move I 'll second mr. Muir moved by Councillor mayor just wait till I get to the 37 move councillor mayor and seconded council of Tom 's wasn 't it yeah okay okay councillor mayor do you wish to speak to this I 'll of the people who lobbied us to reverse this decision everyone that signed the petition the people that picked up the phone and had a chat with us the people that attended the meeting I 'm sorry again I wasn 't there I work now but it was it 's been I think it 's a really great outcome at the time that we originally made the decision it was in close council we didn 't have the luxury of being able to go and speak to the volunteers and going what do you think about this we couldn 't consult it was confidential so you know it 's unfortunate the way that it happened but it didn 't it didn 't get ugly some things get ugly sometimes but I 'm just so impressed with the way that the volunteers handled themselves with this you know they just appealed to us in a very civilized way and we 've got a great outcome and I support the recommendation Thank You Carol Tom 's I echo councillor Sandra mayor 's words in in that originally I was of the former members of the visitor information volunteer group I I certainly changed my position very quickly based on their true love and commitment of the visitor information service that they provided the Frankston foreshore and I 'm very happy to see this turn around from Council it 's it 's one that I 'm pleased to support and I hope that this is a way forward for volley tears and the council to better better manage and service the tourism industry with in Frankston so it 's a good outcome for the volunteers thank you very much coach or akin well I was at the meeting with the volunteers with you mr. Muir and what became very evident is the passion and the great regard that these people have for what they do and how they serve the Frankston community and how they interact particularly how they interact personally with visitors from other places and it 's that personal interaction that does more than any other thing so you know there were a number of things became very evident in the discussion with them a number of avenues of how the diversified those things only were possible through discussion which certainly should have happened in the first instance and didn 't nevertheless we thank the visitor information volunteers for their patience and we together can work for a better outcome and I 'm sure that that will happen Thank You counselor or any other counselors wish to enter debate if not I just like to say I was also as a counselor I can said at the meeting with the volunteers and I 've always known how well they work at the Visitor Information Center when I first became a counselor back in 1980 whatever I was a member of the Visitor Information Center which was placed now where the libraries and the same volunteer service was available then through a fantastic group of Frankston people and as the work that you done to bring this to councilors like I new class are akin you and a few other counselors knew of the work you 're done and you also you brought it to the attention of other of counselors that weren 't perhaps quite a fait with the great work motion and well done des counselor yeah yeah I 'll never forget the excitement joy pride on the faces of the volunteers and the staff when we won that national award and went to the Hall of Fame you know the best Visitor Information Center in the country stays thank you very much okay I 'm gonna put it to the vote all those and save our favor that 's carried unanimously thank you Karen okay item number 11.2 the planning permit application is 197 Kringle drive Frankston so i 'm sorry went beliving point one I 'll beg your pardon eleven point way and we 're doing for us Don I 've jumped which is the report on the findings and recommendations of the panel report which is C one two three do I have a mover do I have a mover of this move cats Lou sounder mayor seconded councillor Tom 's Castle was made you would you wish to add a debate on this just briefly this has been a long time coming there 's been a shift from the previous council where the building heights were outcome I I understand the residents concerns about not having mandatory height controls but I remember years ago we talked about this and we actually I think we did have mandatory height controls some time ago in the Frankston town center and they were they expired and we wrote to the Planning Minister and said could we please extend them and they said no so planning ministers do not like mandatory height controls so I mean we could consider tonight to change the wording I don 't think that will be accepted by the minister what we currently have now will it 's been out to the planning panel the submissions have been taken into consideration the councillors have taken the residents concerns on board and I think that this is a happy compromise and it 's definitely better than what we had so you know we 're taking into consideration the sense of you interface with the creek and and the seaside and all the rest we 're not going to have a big Gold Coast wall you know along the beach side of Nepean Highway so I 'm 've moved this and see what happens so Tom 's also just briefly mr. mayor this is a way forward for future development sensible development in our city center I 'm happy to have worked like with some other councillors with the community groups to come to a realization that twenty meters would be the better height for the community rather than thirty-two what I will say is you know in total agreeance with you is that no State Planning Minister will go for mandatory that 's 100% correct and so I would like it if they did I 'm sure every single counselor would and everybody in the room would but that 's that 's not going to happen so this is a way forward to allow for this sensible and appropriate development and within our our sensitive coastal community and Frankston is a unique city in the fact that we are one of only two municipalities that have a city centre and a foreshore so closely linked together and we of the nine if machs around Melbourne so when I when I talk about the F max I and Frankston ang along and in places like that there 's nine across across Melbourne we are one of them we are one of only two that have our situation so we have to be careful when we talk about planning within that environment so I hope the councillors support this this report of the officer Thank You councillor Kunal and then council McCormack mr. mayor I 've got a question for the Patel planning area and it stems from the submissions made solely to debate and then ask the question both the long I was an island residents group and Frankston Bates Association talked about state government practice note 60 which identifies exceptional circumstances where mandatory height controls can be considered for activity centres so it 's interesting that both those groups of parties if you like mentioned this my third in mind I would like to suggest and I 'd like to ask 10 planning manager why we couldn 't actually put in this document the 20 meter heart as a mandatory requirement rather than as a preferred requirement okay thank you Georgia through you mr. mayor my issue has been discussed before indeed the submissions did come from both the community groups the first time around in terms of councils consideration of the amendment we did make inquiries about Geelong and also with the state government and the response we got was that very exceptional circumstances would be looked at for mandatory controls that the expectation and activity centers was to go with flexible controls and that the example in July for example applied to the parkland rather than the commercial areas which were then further inland so we could as an option ask for that however the advice that we 've had to date has been that it would be very unlikely to be supported by the minister kikuno yeah mr. mayor given that advice I understand it all and I think 20 metres is what 's been asked for by the community and I certainly never supported you and you 're entering debate now I finished well you can ask for a question or you entered mr. mayor I 'll support this as long as the report that 's going to the panel report I make it clear that we want the 20 meter height limit to be mandatory and not preferred minutes if it 's in state government practice note 6 is there 's a chance I might actually approve it debate you just say was how do we achieve that this to me well you want to ask mr. pappagiorgio yes please through you mr. mee you could simply add a recommendation saying that that a mandatory maximum building height of 20 meters apply to that part of the precinct 1 B between the Nepean highway and Kendall Creek well mr. mayor given the advice I 'd like to suggest to the murder and second door that we include that exact yep I 'm happy to run the gauntlet and to see how we go and if it gets knocked back we 'll just be back to where we were which is just as these now so I 'm happy okay happy to give it a go councillor Tom 's are you happy with that councillor Kenny all is right we can try so yes Chancellor McCormack what 's going to debate yeah it not be simpler just to amend 3f and remove the word preferred and replace it with mandatory because that was going to be the basis of my request on page five you want to repeat you want them to remove preferred that 's an insert mandatory exactly acceptable by the mover and seconder yes that 's been accepted okay yeah I think that 'll simplify matters in our file I can enter into debate I agree with councilor colonel and obviously councilors a fully aligned with this position that we don 't preempt the minister 's decision on this one we actually asked the question before self-defeating this is we do live in a unique part of the world and I think we all recognize that we live in a unique part of the world it will only be unique and precious if we continue to place controls over it to ensure that it is that it remains unique enviable as it happens we have a city center that that evolves around the candidate Creek precinct in a row evolves around the foreshore that means that that environmental concerns order to protect those assets that we have if we don 't protect them now Frankston won 't be the same we will lose everything that we 've had the the coastal village atmosphere as much as we 're moving to a central activity center there is no reason why we can 't keep our coastal feel and preserve our environment so I think we should be asking for mandatory requirements we should be referring to practice note 60 and we should be making putting forward the best case that we can about the exceptional place that Frankston is and the exceptional circumstances that exist with respect to this particular planning scheme amendment thank you I got councillor Bolin and then Castro Aiken Thank You mr. mayor I 've got a question too that 's the key to a mr. pappagiorgio on page 9 of the report in terms of the summary of the issues that were raised throughout the submission process there was a dot point that revolves around materials and colors to complement the coastal location my question is you know what is the standard for a universal that just that determination I mean I look at Yonge Street and that 's a it 's almost schizophrenic in its disposition you 've got yellow you 've got orange you 've got gray had early determined as a cancel a universal color scheme George threw it through you mr. mayor I 'll answer it by referring to the guidelines that have been prepared they are guidelines so they 're meant to be suggestions so they 've got urban as well as coastal and contemporary treatments that 's not to say that everybody has to use those but it 's meant to give an indication to potential applicants but that 's the sort of materials that we 've considered and also then there 's the wording that 's referred to elsewhere that treats that sensitive interface and then tries to put into different words the type of feel we 're trying to get so it 's very difficult to be very very prescriptive because we want to allow innovation but we do want to give people a good idea of the sort of outcome we 're looking for in those on page 17 in the second last paragraph there 's mention of new development should be consistent with the design form layout proportion and scale so I presume that would include a color scheme again my reading of that is that the word should I mean there 's there 's no there 's no authority to that so are you saying it 's it 's it 's not not something that has to be adhered adhere to is that my reading of it through instrument it 's it 's meant to be a guideline so in the title of that section and in sort of decision guidelines it 's meant to give some idea about the outcomes that we 're after but it stops short of saying you must use this color in this location because um we 'd like to look at innovation but also give guidance so hence the workshop that we held with the residents talking about the type of character and feel expected in that kind of precinct and we hope that the sort of illustrations in that document carry through the ideas about the sort must be this color or this material okay cash rakin yes look I think whilst the inclusion of twenty metres mandatory height is a very good inclusion to have in this document and I think that 's commendable the rest of the document the general thrust of the document is absolutely dead as far as I 'm concerned because it is basically built on a blueprint that 's provided to abide by state government requirements the state government doesn 't live here they live in other places they live in places remote from Frankston and the bureaucrats have construct these planning laws they don 't live here they live in other places and some of them are very amenable like accountant and big historic homes in Canton or no one such person is involved in key state planning and in fact does live there as well as their Melbourne home but I won 't mention names of course so the people who have these high positions mr. mayor and have vast incomes Pro make proclamations they make proclamations across whole communities my opinion is that the people of Frankston and determine their future in town planning not people who are remote from here and may in fact never be here at all I think the general thrust of the document is devoid of humanity it is certainly well and truly catering for commercial possibilities so the big thing that 's forgotten in all of this and I keep on and on and on about it and I 'm so glad in a way that this is now live stream because it 's permanent record recording I hope it 's permanent of words that are spoken here and maybe they 'll be carried into the future and that is that Frankston streets are narrow they are narrow you go to greater Dandenong where they 're constructing very high buildings under the rebuilding daily non-proposal and they 're very that most of them are very unpleasant buildings too I must add they really are pretty poor imitations of the 1960s and they will date and they 'll date very badly the trouble is you build those buildings of anything around that heart in Frankston and you 're going to have our streets 30 seconds or is that what it is okay thank you so I 'm not going I 'm not going to support the whole document I think the documents as dry as the Sahara that 's as hopeless as anything could be hopeless I 'm not saying that the town planners haven 't done the best of their capability with the materials that they 've got at hand Thank You councillor your 30 seconds was absolutely a fast thank you okay um councillor lien O 'Connor yeah this documents a long time coming in by the FM preparation was put into this I 'm really happy to see the wording change from prepared to mandatory I 'm really comfortable with that moving forward we never know what the minister tradition is going to be but we never know till we try and this is the best way Boyd and get this on them on the ground and rolling and I 'm pretty happy with this Thank You counselor any other cat cats like you know suggestion by councillor icon councillor McCormack at condition F yeah it was it was agreed aw that 's all that 's all I 'm asking mr. pappagiorgio no it doesn 't matter because you 're just reinforcing the point my only concern was that we might have to redraft part of it if it 's gonna be mandatory but by putting it in both places you 've made it very clear what you 're after thank you any other councillors wish to speak on this matter okay cats Lou Sandra mayor could you sum up yes council that can may be right it might not be an inspirational document that we 're now at a point where most of us are comfortable with it and I think that definitely we the residents of this place to decide how our city should look and you know anyone that feels very strongly about this can re reinforce that considering it 's the state election year that we 'll be looking at the minister 's decision very closely Thank You councillor okay I 'm going to put now put it to the vote all those in favor councillor Hampton council O 'Connor councillor Union councillor bollam councillor Tom councillor akin if that motion is carried okay item number 11.2 okay let 's moved by Councillor o 'reilly the of the officers recommendation do I have a seconder whole second second of councillor mayor so it 's moved and seconded Castro Ryan counselor made you wish to speak on this very briefly mr. mayor we had a meeting was it last Thursday other Thursday but can 't remember at at Kringle about the new development the one thing about shopping centers is that as we 're all aware that things are very much going online which puts a lot of pressure on retail we see a lot of empty shops around and Korengal like other shopping centers eg Chadstone Southland and so forth is looking to redevelop it 's going to be a very very big redevelopment it 's going to involve a lot more space a lot more open space a lot more green greenery and it 's also going to include this very large assign now this sign we spoke about in December and it was deferred as there were sir was some concerns having met with I was very very happy with the the proposal now this sign itself is there because the Kringle hub runs alongside the East link which the ACE link has tens of thousands of cars driving past every day and the reason why the sign is of its height which isn 't unusual it 's not something that hasn 't been done before it is not something that will set a precedent for other shopping centers in the area the reason why this is being put forward is because the kirinda Harbor runs alongside the East link and therefore is able to attract people from the East link to our stores potentially what did I say he 's like oh sorry he 's linked potentially they 're all they 're all intermingled okay the the planning application not only passes our planning requirements it doesn 't have any objections from VicRoads and there are only initially two residents that have object those residents we haven 't heard from since I myself am a local resident of the area and I have absolutely no problem with it I not only don 't to going up there I think it 's gonna really redevelop the arrogance to look fantastic and even council Hampton was quite excited about the extensive car parking they 're gonna put in there so as far as I 'm concerned this is a really great thing for the area it 's gonna look magnificent and I 'm really looking forward to it going head thank you Thank You Cara councillor mayor you wish to okay cash vacant opposed this application totally the nature of it will change that part of the face of Frankston forever it is a brutal and unnecessary impost in the Frankston environment that is gaudy it is a case of commercial greed overtaking good planning common sense mr. mayor the scale of the proposed sign is excessive and would unreasonably and detrimental impact upon the low scale vegetated landscape character and amenity of the area by reason of its range of visibility including illumination at night the proposed sign is contrary to the outdoor advertising signage policy clause 20 2.09 of the Frankston planning scheme in that it would visually dominate and detract from the specific objectives for Peninsula link to encourage modest signage modest this is seven stories high seven stories high modest signage and discourage major promotional signs where they will have an adverse visual impact on the landscape and design of East Link and Peninsula Link freeway corridors this is a disgrace this is a public disgrace if this council seriously entertains and we have a mover in this chamber tonight we have a mover for this to advance and go ahead if this actually seriously goes ahead it calls this whole council 's credibility into question to such an extent that one can only wonder is this council really capable of making properly balanced planning decisions around there should appear councillor be quiet for a minute okay in your opinion that 's fine in your opinion that 's fine this brings for the question in the minds of some people mr. mayor should council disappear and be administered if this is the best that Frankston City Council can do for its community this is an aberration it is wrong in every sense I will not be overturned by any commercial overtures high and no one can justify that no one Thank You councillor Tom 's mr. mayor I echo the concerns of cancer Aitken I hate to think that such a grotesque oversized sign would be placed on Frankston beach heaven forbid or down in the middle of our city centre heaven forbid this sets a dangerous precedent going forward in this municipality well it does it sets a dangerous precedent and I think once we make this decision this council will see massive signs like this go up all across the municipality and we won 't be able to stop it that is the reality so if there 's councillors that feel comfortable with that reality that 's that 's far from my comfortable because my comfortable is that this doesn 't go ahead that this is too high this does not comply with the Frankston planning scheme and I will not be supporting the officers recommendation do I have any other counselors wish to enter debate on this councillor Boland the questions to mr. pappagiorgio the comment which is made it doesn 't comply with the Franklin planning scheme you mr. mayor in the report we go through all the policy frameworks and we refer to the particular circumstances of this is a major activity center it 's second only to the F Mac there is no other major activity center and the particular function of the sign is to be read from the freeway so it is quite a unique circumstances and our recommendation is that it does comply thank you okay counselor so just confirming it does comply with the plan okay thank you can I ask a question about the Contra level of consultation and sorry I I don 't have the original report in front of me how many submissions were received and what was the account there were two submissions that were concerned about lighting and glare and increased traffic so both of those submissions were in opposition but both of those submissions were they in opposition that 's correct their objections that 's it thank you mr. mayor councilor akin you you wanted my attention to me yes this point number two was put together by our Planning Department today the proposed signs and that correct or is that not okay that was written by the Planning Department today you know you 're incorrect relating you 're reading a foreshadowed motion which is not I 'm asking a question okay for shadows it 's an ultimate motion mr. mayor but there 's been a comment made there was a question from asked is this contrary to the scheme and the answer was basically no but it is contrary to the outdoor advertising signage policy Clause 22 0.09 okay you 're asking that question mr. Papageorge board having George Yeo through you mr. me we refer to aspects of the advertising policy councils guidelines and policy in the report so we refer to the objectives about being viewed from the freeway the the words that we prepared for council Aitken 's alternate refer to different words there that talked about appropriate to a freeway context and so it 's a question of opinion thank you very much hey I 've got a statement here it 's contrary to the outdoor advertising signage can that be confirmed or not policy mr. pepper dog George you that not so that is an interpretation of elements of the outdoor policy interpretation okay another car so we shouldn 't speak on this matter counsel McCormick just just briefly I think the point being made is that it 's arguable whether or not it meets within with the guidelines the recommendation that has been moved before us by the council offices is that it does but there 's certainly an argument to be made that it doesn 't especially given that there is no sign of this magnitude anywhere within the municipality at this stage so when councillors are referring to setting a precedent it certainly does it will be the first of this magnitude in the municipality therefore any future applications will be dealt with on the basis of this particular signage being in existence and you know there will always no doubt the extenuating circumstances or commercial imperatives for particular signage but it 's whether or not as a municipality we want to have that kind of visual bulk become prominent anywhere in the municipality I for one don 't want to say signage of this magnitude there are alternatives for the shopping center to look at in terms of encouraging custom from the peninsula Lincoln and various areas so I won 't be supporting there the motion that 's before us and had councilor Atkin had the opportunity to put forward his alternate recommendation I would have supported that okay only other Kansas wish to speak on this councilor yeah just briefly I know you 're looking to see here are the issues I 'm going to actually abstain on this and I don 't like to abstain but given that there 's too much grayness about whoever it 's consistent with the planning scheme or not I think it 's best for me to err on the side of caution and the reason why I 'm following this approach is if this were to go to VCAT biggest defense or biggest justifier would be it being inconsistent with the planning scheme the fact we can 't tonight ascertain that leaves me no choice pursue i abstain on this matter which is disappointing so perhaps in the future we need to get more clarity before these consistent that these things are consistent or not with our own planning schemes I think it 's also important not to confuse the meeting we had Thursday week with this proposal that was about the wholesale redevelopment of the Kringle hub site this is about a sign so I think we need to stick on the issue and not not look at the broader proposal that 's been put forward by a Kringle hub that 's all I 'm prepared to say within the context of planning on this matter thank you any other councillors no well I wish to say something and I 'm speaking after okay just like to say that sometimes in here the theatrics in this place would put Pete O 'Toole to shame I was the only council that actually turned up on the day for the demonstration height with this balloon and it was a very windy day had this huge balloon at the back of Korengal hub and I mean at the back of Kalinga hub it 's not in a huge position at the front it 's right at the back of sign but they put one there anyway they were going to put it up to 25 meters with the plumes I was gonna go down the freeway and come and try and look at the balloon from the freeway but I got just near the entrance of a Korean girl had to get out onto the freeway and I get a phone call you don 't have to come back because the balloon has escaped the blue escaped in the wind but Tama got back it was up ten thousand feet in the sky but fortunately the owners of Korengal had done a video beforehand and the video shows quite well how intrusive this sign would be and to be honest with you I don 't think it 's intrusive at all it 's not as intrusive as most of the signs along Peninsula link which hits you in the eye when you 're driving and I 'm talking about driving councilors you know some some of us do and I could write on that highway all the time and there are signs on that Highway that hit you in thing when you 're coming from the south the only time you really got a good view is when you 're coming to the north and can we just say this that development in Korengal hub is going to be magnificent it 's a hundred and ten million dollar developments the mayor I got a call a point of order and the point of order is a number 59 B is irrelevant to the matter under consideration we 're talking about the the sign we 're not talking about the redevelopment well I 'm talking about the song where the sign is the mayor I 've caught a point of what we 're gonna be very careful as you know okay yeah well I don 't hear your point of order because I 'm talking about the sign and why the sign is there the sign is there because of the development and for no other reason you keep going mister there thank you and as I said you can hardly see the sign coming from the south but coming from the north can actually see it and this development to display that sign and it is not intrusive like other people have said is not as intrusive as what they said because it 's in the in the rear of the car park at Kerr Engel as that effect or is that your opinion this to me well counselor it 's got nothing to do with you I 'm trying to talk do you mind being quiet I said do you mind being quiet just the okay I was quiet and had I had the courtesy to be quiet when you were talking I think you should give me the same courtesy anyway I did have concerns about the height and that 's why I actually went down there on the day to try and view it and I have to say no other counselor was here other than myself so I went out my way to find out and fortunately they taken a video and the videos showed quite clearly it could be seen but it 's not intrusive so I 'll be voting for it okay so mayor yes as was stated Kringle hobbies our second largest the area apparently the owners of the shopping center have great plans for the future which is great for the local residents and great for our local economy I 'm reassured in hearing that it 's not going to be too much of an eyesore which is very comforting to know I think there 's a new sign I was just trying at the day I was trying to member where it was I think it was at the start of the Frankston freeway and it 's I think it 's equi and it 's a mess even it just hits you in the face I thought if it 's like that there 's no way I 'd support it but um yeah I think I 'm ok with this one ok councillors I 'll put it to the vote all isn 't oh sorry to characterize you honest you have to sum up please what we were doing here I thought it was a sign at a shopping center but obviously it 's more than that ok I will sum up by not going over the old things we at a shopping center but what I like to do is to go over the arguments again see if I can contradict them now I just took a look at the people that are complaining about this development and I just want to know if any of these are actual planning arguments or they 're just statements cuz this is all I got it 's a public disgrace it 's a disgrace it 's brutal it 's unnecessary it 's bad common-sense planning it destroys a credit credibility of the council it destroys our ability to make decisions it 's an aberration it 's wrong in every sense it 's seven stories high it 's seven stories high it 's seven stories high it 's a dangerous precedent well unfortunately they 're not genuine planning arguments their opinion and their statements the genuine planning arguments are in the planning report and they 've been put together by our officers who approve this and there 's no objection to Victor ODEs and there 's very only two objections from residents of whom we haven 't heard from in months I will even know what that really is that the Chadstone shopping center is going to have a hotel of 13 stories high almost double and as far as its being a science going up everywhere in there being a dangerous precedence well we just had a submission from someone who clearly explained the only reason we 're having a sign like this is because it goes past the peninsula link and they wouldn 't bother doing it anywhere else because it 's completely unnecessary so anyway to finish up if you reject something without valid planning grounds simply based on a whole bunch of dancing and singing in the chamber it goes to vacate and gets overturned I don 't avoid a mr. mayor in my opinion it goes to VCAT overturn what 's your point of all comments about dancing and singer and our offensive and yes nine if it 's a fancy I believe the counselors trying to belittle the genuine comments that are made in a balanced way you are by another can make a decision on this I hold your point of order okay casually continue I over dramatization but that is my you weren 't trying to be dramatic where oh no not at all I don 't like to be dramatic at all again like I said another comment was made that it is commercial greed now I go to the shingle shopping center all the time and I explained this last time they are not big evil conglomerates they 're little stores yes it is a big company that is doing this redevelopment but they are renting the shops and they need their businesses to survive so like I said I spoke to a few of them they were quite happy to see this in fact they are excited about it and I 'm looking forward to seeing this go up because I think it 's a great thing for the small businesses it 's a great thing for the area and it 's a great thing for Frankston city to have our retail sector supported in this way thank you Thank You councillor I 'll now put it to the vote all those in favor councillor Hampton can 't_''_6865.89 some junior counselor mayor councillor McCourt accounts for Aiken councillor Tom 's and councillor McCormick and one abstention it 's now for all and on the chair I shall vote that this go through Thank You counselors okay item number 11.3 which is a planning permit for a three McLean Court Frankston do I have a

carried unanimously okay item number eleven point five which is two five in page two five eight Oh me moved by Councillor mayor seconded Oh was it I thought them sorry casual McCormack I heard the voice come from over there okay who buy cash from McCormick seconded by Councillor mayor okay do you wish to speak on this councillors does any other casters wish to speak on it alright I 'll put the motion all those in favor carried unanimously mr. mayor could I request that we have a break yeah yeah we can have a break for ten minutes back at 10 past 00 come on they 're pigeons in your pigeonhole God council McCormack okay whereas we resume the meeting at 11 minutes past accounts laocoön your counselor kun your cache may wish to speak on this matter anyone used to speak on this matter no or I 'll put it all all those in favor carried unanimously the Victorian electoral and a LGA mr. mayor I have an alternative recommendation mr. merits the inclusion of one single line I 've headed a line D in number two which should read Belvedere sporting precinct and in brackets capital works based priority okay it 's been moved by councillor Boland seconded yeah mr. Morelle second seconded by councillor Tom 's catch the ball and would you like to speak on this moon cash no Tom 's thank you so my concern with the original recommendation is that it omits any reference of funding opportunities for the Belvedere sporting precinct and when I talk of the ability is sporting precinct I talk of not just the existing hopefully soon to be renamed Linden house facility but also the Belvedere bowls club the Linden House proposal with her different figures ranging from 3 million to 7 million all the way up to 12 million dollars it 's council to take on those costs alone is unrealistic so we need to be reaching out to our state and federal counterparts and this upcoming trip to Canberra it 's an ample opportunity for the mayor and council the Tom 's to put the case forth that this is a great proposal that can deliver some great outcomes for the community not just from a sporting or health perspective but also giving a publicly funded facility back to the people of Seaford which is very important so that 's why I 've included that addition councillor Tom 's I don 't need to say anything mr. mayor any counselors councillor canula mr. mayor I 'd like to speak very briefly I 'm a little bit concerned about adding how the projects to to the list of things we advocating for we 've known for some time this council and we 've agreed for some time on what we would be advocating for in the lead up to the next state election which is happening in November so we don 't know what the cost is going to be to to useful in the future and I don 't think I don 't think it 's fair to include Belvedere sporting precinct at this stage it should have been something that was discussed with other councillors and it 's something that should have been agreed to by the entire council I mean sorry mr. mayor point of order error of fact this was discussed last Monday at the pre agenda meeting well I can 't remember that I do you were complaining right I can 't remember but regardless of that mr. Mann we 've we 've known for a long time now what the advocacy projects are and I disagree with adding anything else to it I think we need to concentrate on what we 've all agreed to and press on from there so I can 't support it I 'm sorry if I also else I 'll move the officers okay akin mr. mayor the situation with linen house has changed as we all know because of the Alex RA works and that 's an whilst it 's been a long time coming it 's when it did circumstances around relocation of clubs and also of the future needs for that building that building to accommodate what council desires to do or I would think it 's going to cost a lot of money it 's only reasonable to see it as a major project in the city for which we would I would think if we can have any way of avoiding paying all the costs then then I would think that would be desirable I know that there will be some offsets through an agreement made already but I don 't see that it 's unreasonable to try and do better for our community if we can and that is the intent of that point and I support it completely and in fact I think it 's very fair it would be unfair to our community if we didn 't put it there thank you any other councillors wish to speak to this okay so Matt yeah I don 't have any strong opposition to this my only concern is that just because it was mentioned at a pre agenda meeting last Monday doesn 't mean as to what the future of the site is so we had a briefing which I won 't talk about you know in the public meeting because I don 't know if it 's confidential or what but you know about the possible future use of the site and there is a number of parties that were at the briefing and they were just there to present a possible option to us but we don 't act we haven 't actually decided that so I 'm just kind of in my head going through it 's April now this will be going to Canberra in June so what are we actually going to be briefing ministers on if we don 't know what it is that we want in that precinct and how much it 's going to cost so that 's that 's my only concern with it if we had of discussed as a group and we had have decided as a group what we wanted to do with that precinct I would wholeheartedly support adding that in okay any other characters wish to end a debate on 'll into debate on this I think it 's very unfair that this proposed will be put up and I can 't I can 't remember it being put up last Monday but I don 't remember a lot of things I 'm getting old but to say that this would be a priority over and above other capital works projects that we have at hand I think is very unfair especially bearing in mind that I went and negotiated with Alex RA 2.8 million dollars towards Belvedere and the complex at Belvedere I think that once we get to understand and know what needs to be done at Belvedere then we can then start to lobby governments especially the federal government because by then we 'll have that opportunity but to jump in and put this project in and above every other project and every other Ward I think is very very unfair especially bearing in mind what works are going to be done at Belvedere in the next six months 2.8 million dollars worth of work and I mean I 'll do whatever you tell me to do to but I think this to make it a priority is not it 's not good it came up at the last minute and it hasn 't had a real good we haven 't had a real good talk about it so I vote against it thank you for that so I think it 's worth mentioning first and foremost and this is where I go into self preservation mode if you look at that that list up on the screen you have every single Ward covered fabric a capital project sands the Northwest board which has nothing so from my perspective as a ward cancer it 's in my best interest to ensure that we get a piece of the funding pie now let 's face the reality or let 's face the facts this proposal this facility cannot operate without monies and I think it 's unfair for the council to wholly and solely be expected to fund that facility particularly if it 's going to have a regional focus if we don 't fund it now when is it going to open you know the next opportunity for these monies and I don 't think the expectations should be that we wait for those for this opportunity this time next year your voice still got to keep thank you you 've also got to keep in mind that the public expect this facility to be open reopened and I am not in the mood nor I don 't nor do I think the majority of councils around this room are in the mood for all of delaying the reopening of this facility the Belvedere precinct and not only am I talking about Linden house again we 're also talking about the Belvedere Bowles so there 's a multi-faceted approach this precincts proposal it 's not just one facility it 's multiple facilities and if the council doesn 't put up its hand now and seek monies it 's going to delay via the inevitable reopening of this facility the officers have said to us internally funding is required the officers have said to us the facility cannot be functional and this is funding your sort therefore council by virtue and using deductive logic needs this money so and you know it 's something that we need to do ok Thank You councillor or I appeal to the vote all those in favor cashflow corner councillor bollam counts are akin councillor Tom 's and councillor Cormac all those against councillor Hampton counts Laocoon your counsellor mayor Councillor Riley that motions carried okay this next item I am have an interest so I shall be moving out not got a direct interest but I have an interest so I think it 's better for me to actually leave the chair and call on the deputy mayor to come take the chair okay 12.3 outbound delegation to sister cities you know Japan do a hyper movie but Oh move move this ain 't your mag do I have a second ah Keisuke no thank you did a movie but we should speak yes I will so every couple of years we take turns with Suzhou no and I 'm not sure if it is it the same for wishy as well but I know that we we have a Suzhou no association and they come here one year and there it works and with the Japanese it 's all about honor as well so I think there is a little bit of a concern because we have had a discussion prior to today about there being some opposition to the mayor attending and representing Frankston in Japan I 'm not sure if this will be a delegation going anyway that um yeah it 's sort of not a good look if we don 't have a council representative some years we haven 't had the mayor we 've had another council are going but I don 't see a problem with this so I support the recommendation thank you question deputy mayor the question is to yourself or the CEO given that the mayor will be out of the country for quite a few days will the acting mayor provisions be activated you mean a council bomb in the absence of the mayor the deputy mayor takes precedent if there was a council meeting for example and other meetings that required that required the attendance of the mayor if the mayor is not in the country then it would fall catch me Pino do you wish to speak look I 'll speak pretty briefly I think councillors when making a decision on this have to consider a couple of things and probably there 's two important things in my view one is that the Frankston Susanoo Friendship Association is a sister city relationship that we have with the city of cesano at the foothills of Mount Fuji or mount Fujiyama in Japan that relationships been going for 36 years it 's a great time there francis Asano Friendship Association is a really good group of people who have an interest in the Japanese culture they actively get involved with kids that are learning Japanese in in and around Frankston they have speech contests once every so often I think it 's maybe two or three years they have an Australian Fair either in Susanoo or they have a fair a Japanese Fair in Frank 's here with in Frankston last time at a Japanese Fair was at Frankston high and I think it was maybe last year the year before from memory the other thing you need to consider is period of time it would only be fair to send a representative of this municipality over to Japan and the obvious choice would be the mayor of the city the cost in the report indicates that it would be around 2400 for air fares and accommodation or if the mayor is going and if we vote the Ticos if he stays at a homestay situation the cost would be 1,800 either way the cost is very minimal so consider that when making a decision counselors I 'm going to support it I 've been on the Franklin cesano friendship association committee during my first couple of years on council we don 't have a counselor representative anymore we do have an officer of counseling Chris Hodgins who does a good job in assisting the Franklin cesano Friendship Association I think might be every two months I 'm gonna finish my debate by asking a question the dates that are proposed I 'm just wondering if those dates well if the mayor goes will he be away during one of the ordinary meetings no our set because I we don 't your madam deputy mayor I 'll try and see whether I can see mr. frederick areas quickly looking at the list of meeting dates through you madam deputy mayor I 've had confirmation from the other side of the room the mayor will be away for a council meeting an ordinary meeting all right put another question similar to the one I just asked about the acting mayor provisions can the CEO or the relevant officer confirm to me that the acting their precedent is enshrines within the Local Government Act is that correct yes through you madam deputy mayor mr. Frederico is going to the relevant section of the Local Government Act but I believe it is the precedent is set that in the event that the mayor cannot just attend a council meeting then the deputy mayor would take precedent excellent team we can we can vocalize that 's fine thank you thank you caseload Tom Thank You deputy mayor I 'm happy to support the mayor going to so Sonu and the relationship between this city and Cicero city is a special one I have been involved that Peter Patterson and two rays do as was mentioned by councilor kennel and council cuneo did mention the a Japanese fair last year that he and I and the mayor attended at Frankston high school it was a wonderful cultural fair and I think that the city of cesano really values the friendship that we we hold with with them and I think the city of Frankston equally so so I think to not send a representative to to this wonderful country which I have been fortunate to visit for this purpose would be a great shame so I 'll be I will be supporting the mayor attending the event since this honor thank you do you have any other speakers yep Tom weak thank you I 'm opposed to this I 'm opposed to council investing any money in the sister city relationships full-stop I 've mentioned that previously but I 'm certainly opposed to spending money on on overseas trips it was certainly part of my election campaign that I wouldn 't be supporting overseas funded trips on behalf of councillors or or mares so I will benefit to the city of Frankston that will come off the mayor visiting Japan it is a friendship relationship and there certainly is a friendship group and there will be still a friendship group whether the merits so no or not think he do I have any other speakers do you have a question just a quick one can we confirm is there a delegation going or was it just the mayor by myself through you madam deputy mayor to council bollam I understand that the mayor would form a part of a delegation including a number of the representatives of the Frankston Susanoo organization here so he would be included in that delegation thank you I do have a couple of way to say before I go ahead I do agree with química me two remarks I 'm very uncertain about this trip I don 't know what benefit will provide your function so I 'm a little unsure about that but hey the other points quite a minimal cost trip so Wade that up at the end any other speakers yeah I 'll just be quick I don quindi as well but was one of my campaign slogans was no overseas trips and oppose any who do I remember many years ago this is actually relatively cheap and cheerful comparatively to what our state and federal government counterparts do I remember the mayor of when our about 15 years ago flew business class to assist the city and the cost of something like six thousand dollars and his reasoning for that was well mayor 's fly business class it 's good to see that we 're not doing that but I did say that I oppose overseas trips I do oppose overseas trips and I 'm not a big fan of the sister city relationship I don 't see how having a sister city in opposed to all the other cities anywhere else in the world or in Japan can benefit us or benefit them so I don 't approve of it so I 'll be voting against this okay any other speakers Decatur bollam I wasn 't going to talk in this as well but as someone that 's been to cesano myself I went there a the kids go through the kids that attend as a part of delegate the delegation it 's incredible you know the cultural immersion they experience I think there are about 15 to 20 heads that went when I went in 2010 and it was it was amazing they really got a lot out of it and I think that 's what we 're forgetting out of all this debate is the cultural exchange aspect of this I think in 2010 it was McLellan College and I believe from what council Akunyili was saying Frankston hive also sent students as well so it 's not one student segment that is having this marvelous experience I sort clarity from one of the offices and there is an Australian government federal initiative called the Colombo Plan which is very similar where students go overseas for a few weeks and they gain a different experience in an in a classroom environment this is not quite on the same page but again it this provides them the opportunity to experience a different culture and hopefully gain some real-life experiences so from that context I think we 're talking about retaining the the cultural respect and sensitivities of the people of Japan so to me it 's a no-brainer okay shaking Thank You deputy may look I I 've got mixed views on it one is that I think that the cultural exchange aspect of it is quite okay and I think that the experience that it provides for students or young people from the city which it does and has done over a number of years is excellent but I also am mindful of the climate that we are in and I think under any circumstances pretty much for the rate payers of Frankston to see a member of council being flown over to Japan and back in a rate capping environment which were quick to remind the residents of and the state government of as well it 's it 's hard to it 's hard to convinced people of the of the necessity for that so unbalanced I 'm not against the delegation going and I think that that 's fine but as far as a member of the council goes I won 't least you 've spoken yeah you sum up me okay so um I really can 't add much to what council bomb said he spoke beautifully on it I couldn 't say it any better myself in regards to right company it 's I actually made a mistake I thought it was every year we alternate it 's actually been four years since we 've been so what do we do do we say no every time we 're invited now because of rate capping that 's not a good look like I said that 's Japanese are all about honor and you know the Chinese relationship China or major you know power player economically in the world and so it 's sort of good to build relationships you know and yeah I don 't think you can choose one over the other and to do a blanket policy of no no overseas trips I respect you every counselors right to vote however they see fit and I don 't know what the benefits will be but I guess as a delegate if councillor Hampton has the mayor has the report back to the council because I think that 's actually something that we brought in for anyone who goes on a conference or anything like that under delegates reports in every ordinary meeting he would have to come back and report to us on what his learnings were and what he got out of the exchange so it 's a good way to find out and it 's not an expensive way to find out okay think he I 'll put it to the vote all those in Bebo cash Latino cash the Bolam cantaloup Tom 's in cancer mail those who oppose council O 'Connor counselor 18 councillor O 'Reilly cancer McCormick now I have the casting vote and I 'll go opposed okay Oh open the amiran no I nearly went to sleep out there okay we 're on to twelve point four which is the audit and Risk Committee charter so I have a new ver ha we 've move capsular Sandra Mayer seconded I 'll second seconded by Councillor Tom 's past the mayor cash for Toms do you wish to talk on this issue to speak on this I 'll move that motion all those in favor carried unanimously okay item number 12.5 establishment of a facade improvement grant and wall green wall proof of concept which is on page mr. Muir there 's a note to know if this is last up or shadow the alternate just put just put up just put the alternate yeah okay the alternate has been moved by Councillor Tom 's seconded by Councillor Boland councillor Thomas has a bomb I 'm sorry Chancellor Kunis a bloody first time tonight okay I wasn 't looking up I thought I heard the voice no it 's not so I don 't_''_8693.149 I don 't sound her my own and I did I didn 't do thank goodness it 's being recorded I 'll go back to the recording anyway cash was do you wish to speak on this item just briefly mr. mayor I 'm pleased to say the direction that this is going going in councillor Cooney a lot and I have worked on this this alternate this alternatives proposing that we do a proof of concept on green leafy wall that 'll make this city look all the better and I 've been speaking about this for some time about greening our city and and I will continue to it 's it 's a wonderful thing that we need to do and and this this is proposed and a very reasonable amount of money be spent to get with what the rest of the country and councils around the country are doing which is is putting green walls around the city center so I absolutely support the the recommend the alternate recommendation councillor Cunha I 'll reserve Thank You mr. mayor actually I can a an adjustment made to the alternate and point number six notes that detailed costing has been made available and this is before the commencement of the works I would prefer that that be firmed up and that the states the notes that detailed costings be made available to councillors to approve at a at a council meeting before the commencement of the works because they 're gonna have to go under close scrutiny those costs aww seems reasonable mr. mayor well okay or okay with it yes okay all right um do I have any Cash 's wish to talk this cast oh yeah my apologies I and I did advise counsel of Thomas and counsel Kenny all that I was likely going to oppose this and I will be opposing it firstly I was one that suggested to counsel Tom said he pursue a a prove the concept and I 'm pleased to see that he 's taking that on board I personally I 'm supportive of Green walling especially green walls that uplift and transform an area for instance transfer of gentrification and or urban renewal purposes however the proposed trial costings are in my view quite outrageous and I say this not not to embarrass any staff member that wrote the report but from a layman these expenses are just incredible and I say that in terms of both scope and expenditure from the a scope perspective there 's very little segments and or areas of a given building that are actually covered by the proposed green walling and I refer to the various examples that councillors have a a given building and also the selected sites are not in areas that are in great great need of urban renewal for instance this area here I think it 's safe to say this is the Paris in the Frankston where you really need this work is is a is a at the coalface around Yonge Street and around areas that are in great need of a bit of a spruce up I also mention expenditure and I believe that it can be done cheaper and cancer akin while we 're having a chat before the meeting tonight and given his experience he seems to feel that it could be done a lot lot cheaper not at an expense of fifty four thousand dollars for one site furthermore I think this this reinforces the moronic sums that councils pay for about capital projects you know if this was a residential development or if it was a community group based endeavor I venture to say that the expense will be far less but unfortunately expenditure in this case is highly inflated and in my view it hurts who justify some of in Frankston 47,000 for a site in Seaford the safety community center 35,000 for a site at the Frankston function sensor 32,000 for the ballon park toilet I think we 're looking at 32 thousand dollars if we covered all three walls and for the Frankston Civic Center we 're looking over fifty thousand dollars just to do four columns out at the front of the building so I find that very hard to justify here we are debating 2,500 for the mare to go with the throne oh and yet we 're potentially putting money up over fifty thousand dollars put one single green wall so from my perspective up on they 're very hard to justify okay Cashner Aiken yeah for one who is well acquainted with garden design and costs I 'm happy to support this proposal but that 's why I wanted point number six included I think detailed costings have to be made available to councilors to approve at a council meeting before commencement of any works because I cannot I just cannot in any way shape or form understand how the types of costs at essentially mr. mayor what it is is putting a trellis up and planting plants that 's what it is it is what it is that 's putting a trellis up and planting plants how does that cost fifty four thousand dollars I mean you could build a small a small unit for that or part of the unit for that so I you know when when we talk trellis or nothing silly and just saying go to a local outlet and buy some cheap pine trellising obviously it 's got to be steel and it 's going to be a fixed properly that 's reasonable but that does not cost that sort of money it never has it never will unless people decide that they want to be ripped off so we need to have first of all I think there has to be quotations a number of quotations if we 're going to get this work done and we have to see what those quotations are we have to make comparisons about the materials and I think we also need to exercise the common sense measure of going gritty grilling being cut up how much it 's going to cost and how much we could actually pay for someone to just apply the diner bolts to hold it on and then plan a plan so the principle fine but the detail Chea it 's really gonna have to be looked at closely any other characters wish to debate this castle mo I 'm really excited about these councillor Tom 's and I 've been talking about it since he was elected to council and I was reelected and I know that it 's one of those things that our council liked and has always supported greening and beautifying the city and and I wholeheartedly agree actually with everything that 's been said the cost is ridiculous Ozzy 's everything for Council and I 'm hoping that it does come in at a reasonable amount of money and that doesn 't end up dying and it 's well-maintained and all the rest and I have a garden full of succulents that I 'm prepared to offer you just snap off a bit and propagate it just put it in to the indigenous nursery to actually am there those nice kind of purply ones you know they 're great a lot of them yeah I 'm excited about this and I wholeheartedly support it and I think it 's about time we beautified the Civic Center I will never forget councillor Aitken 's statement about the Civic Centre when we were shown some possible designs for the facade and I don 't know if I 'm allowed to say it in public you can 't_''_9212.939 polish do you remember it was a it was hilarious and couldn 't stop laughing anyway Thank You councillor cash the Union I 'll be brief mr. mayor there 's a lot of things around this place that need to be beautified with cement is that a lot of things probably million cluded anyway look I just I do fully support it I think it 's a size a year you can 't that 's right you can 't_''_9238.26 do that to me about my mother adores me fortunately um she 's got um look I support it completely I echo the concerns quite a quite excessive I agree and it wouldn 't surprise me if the detail costings when they do come back come back in a much more realistic figure but I completely support the motion thank you you know the characters councillor Tom 's run up some up yes mr. mayor just briefly a lot has been talked about costs and I wholeheartedly agree we need to be prudent with right payers money but I will note that in later in this meeting we 're talking about other costs and I think this cost is relatively minimal in in respect to costing so 50,000 is is not is not for some people not a lot of money but for some for council to be original and for council to you know put put this wonderful green scape and out on our building I think is really original and and I it should be celebrated okay councillors I 'll put it to the vote all those in favor councillor Hampton councillor Lillian O 'Connor councillor q 'l councillor akin councillor Tom 's Castle Amer Casey O 'Riley council around McCormack oh you like up didn 't you normally it 's the other way round you know what I can 't see but okay those against cancer I was looking at I really got some abstention calliroi is against abstentions councillor Bolin motion is carried okay item 12 point six which is the Warren right road to the Lapwing court special charge scheme do I have a mover oh okay move Cassandra mayor seconded counselor Oh Riley councillors do wish to speak on this I 'm just quickly I 'm not even sure if this is my ward because I think it all got redistributed and everything else it was half and half okay all right well well providing that the residents are happy there 's a lot in this recommendation again it 's probably a very long process to get to this point now and so I support going out there and starting this special charge scheme it says we 've received a number of submissions and yeah ready to go thank you Castro Riley Giusti any other speakers on this laughter no the speakers counselor would you like to sum up okay unanimously okay can not Creek management says to me I 'll second mr. mayor moved by Councillor Tom 's second to my counselor Boland councillor Tom 's castle bomb do you wish to speak on this issue yes mr. mayor just briefly and this is providing a way a way forward for the issues surrounding the siltation on cannot Creek and I was involved in a meeting last year with several community stakeholders and Melbourne Water the APA and Parks Victoria with regards to this issue I was I 've been approached by the former mayor of this city very priestly about this issue I know that for the residents that live live along Canon not Creek this is a huge issue and it should be a huge issue for all of us so and really where the responsibility should lay is with the state government and yet somehow the state government are putting all the onus on to council and saying Council through the ministerial advisory committee you have to you have to pay and you you have to ensure it 's your responsibility actually it 's a state that Council is spending fifty thousand dollars in the capital works program to develop a preferred option to manage the sediment issue but I really think that the state government should be playing a greater role and the local members of parliament with with regards to this issue in one of our largest waterway so now in our municipalities so I support the officers recommendation okay councillor akin there 's two local members in particular Paul ed broker and also Sonia Kilkenny who they 're the the waterway runs through their electorates and I would expect that they 'd be vocal about this in the interests of the general community and the health of the creek itself and in the broader context of our environment mr. mayor we need to be particularly careful because I don 't think council should put itself in any position I 'm prepared to support this motion the council should not put itself in any position which opens the door for the responsibility of Kennin or creeks for management being devolved on to Frank 's the City Council because that will cost millions and millions where currently it 's held by the state on to a local council and that 's something that we need to be very very careful of cash labelled as second there I 'll I 'll speak mister math what I like about this report is its simplicity and what I mean by that is it 's divided into three quadrants firstly it focuses on the creeks mouth the mouth of the creek which has a large sediment buildup of sand it also focuses on the governance arrangements that cancer akin accounts all times have spoken about you might recall last year the state government offered council a very tokenistic amount of money I think was 30 odd thousand in exchange for our taking over the management of the creek which the council promptly said no thank you to so that 'll be addressed in this report also something that cancer Aiken and I have spoken about quite a bit is the siltation issues which is something that occurs throughout that the entirety of the creek and includes done includes dumped rubbish submerged materials and metals and a lack of dredging focused on in this recommendation and I 'm looking forward to what Doug and he 'll come back with next year in terms of a possible solution any other case or do speak on this issue if not cash flow tal just to sum up mr. Muir it 's all been said okay I 'll put the motion all those in favor carried unanimously okay the Franks turnout Board minutes I mean move councillor mayor second the councillor O 'Reily council as you wish to speak on this item okay no any other kind of switch to speak if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor carried unanimously twelve point nine counts representatives to the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port biosphere I understand there 's an alternate motion that 's been put up which apparently was the original motion which Kalem mcCormick brought to Council so do I have a mover of that leave my castle McCormick seconded second capsule q 'l cache McCormick councillor McCune would you wish to speak to this I 'll speak just quickly because obviously I 'm a subject of the motion appointed delegate to the Mornington Peninsula in Westernport past few reserve foundation counselor liaison committee which is quite a mouthful and I 'm glad I got it out at this time of the evening at our recent council a liaison committee meeting we appointed the director and alternate director the there are five councils involved in the across the biosphere and the director will be councillor David Gill from Mornington Peninsula Shire with myself as an alternative director the structure of this of this motion is basically to set up the idea of the councillor Leo 's and comedian and what involvement Council will have with the biosphere foundation moving forward so each council which of the five member councils will be moving the same motion okay any other kind of wish to speak to this item if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor aye carried unanimously okay we go on now you miss item 13.2 always dealt with that for going to the rescission motion which is 14.1 I beg your pardon sorry 12.10 I missed that okay do I have a move 12.10 we 's castle mayor casual thomas do you wish to speak to this manner nope no catch Secunia yes it 's a possible mister so you know that prior to the mayor of the day and he 's well whoever else is going to the mov State Council that some information can be put together for the mayor of the day so that he can actually speak and Thomas can actually speak to these motions when they debate them in the the state council meeting through you mr. mayor to council Cooney all yes we would do that some of the motions are quite straightforward others will probably require officers to prepare some briefing notes in the event that the mayor is asked to actually speak to the motion and it is only the mayor that can actually speak without the leave of the State Council for an officer and or an alternative so the mayor will will be fully briefed thank you catch the ball I just wanted to briefly touch on the motions that are going to be submitted to the State Council and I note that last year the our state government actually I believe even the herald-sun_,_9942.89 didn 't article and kudos to councilor Kunia land councilor Hampton forgetting those motions history to state council this year we 're proposing I think ten all out ten motions which is quite extraordinary extraordinary for a council most councils on average usually like one or two up but the fact we 're putting ten up on what are very diverse issues I think that 's great and it goes to show that council was really lobbying on behalf of its residents so the only other thing I would say is that probably three of those motions relate to the continued sense that there is a deep state or maybe bureaucratic overreach occurring and I guess from my perspective I 'd like to briefly talk about that I feel as a cancer and other councils are free to disagree that there is a gradual creep of unelected bureaucrat ik overreach in the Democratic decision-making process be it the federal state or local and I don 't say that to disparage bureaucrats some of them including those that are in the their inclusion in the democratic process there has to be a fine line drawn and I know I 'm not the only council that feels that way we see it in state bureaucracy we see the federal bureaucracy we even sit in local government where there is confusion as to where the council and where the operational form so from my angst to what is in writing that 's where I 'm coming from and I 'm sure there are other councils around this room that appreciate the role that public office holds in a healthy debate in a healthy in a healthy democracy thank you any other councils to speak to this counselor may you want to sum up yes just to forewarn our delegate that we have it well here in um AV now pretty much whenever new president the previous president sometimes didn 't invite the mover to speak to a motion and things could just go down without you even getting to have a say I 'm hoping that doesn 't happen this time the other thing to be aware of which you can appeal is roll it into one and so if you 're if you think yours is a little bit different to the other ones you actually can 't appeal that but it 's yeah they 'll go that 's just like the other ones we 're just going to move and they 'll choose one particular counsel 's motion so just be aware of that and when you go to debate and that you know if you 're not happy with that happening that you might ask for yours to be considered separately as well okay I now put the motion all those in favor carried unanimously okay now we 're item 14 point 1 which is a rescission motion 13.1 I 'll move it mr Mackey I want to get there quickly okay unemployment in Frankston okay response to nom one three one two I got a mover moving councillor bollam seconded second McCormick 's moved and seconded his move and seconded wish to speak to this item thank you so this proposal actually came about during election time in 2016 can 't_''_10160.989 I think it was myself in councilor our outside the Mechanics Institute and a lady came running up to us and she was very upset her daughter is disabled and can 't find work and she wanted to know where the council offered any work experience or apprenticeship programs and myself in cancer was Tom was not being on the council had no idea and she 's always stuck in my mind and I wish that I got her details but that 's that was the genesis behind this initial notice emotion that is now come back as a report that we try and provide residents in our municipality opportunities that may not be afforded in traditional workplaces and that could be a people with disabilities it could be young people it could be people that are long-term unemployed in this instance the officers have come back with a recommendation that we focus on young people which makes sense considering that franksen and the Mornington Peninsula have among the lowest also among the highest post-secondary education transference so the report more or less states will come back to cancel in September and will provide your model to go been done thus far I 'm happy with the recommendation okay don 't have any other speakers on this councillor McCormick now okay castleball and wish to sum up and a Miss Turner okay well I 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried unanimously now on to item fourteen point one mr. de right I propose the rescission before us tonight okay move councillor bollam and seconded katstra aiken you two councillors wish to speak to this item sorry is that it 's the rescission procedural well no I will speak to it Thank You mr. mayor so this was no surprise I did state at the last council meeting that I would be lodging a rescission and this is what we have before us tonight it was raised due to my concern that the concerns of the residents who cancer akin cancer econo at the CEO and myself met with last month were not fully captured in the original report to Council this is a real issue that requires a proactive response from counsel and I note that councillors not last week the week before there placed site that required officer interventions so the issues haven 't been resolved they are still ongoing and as I said we need to really provide with it really need to provide the residents of absolute place with a proactive approach for those that may not be aware in 2014 the business started operating at the absolute place location without a permit and what 's happened is a range of amenity issues and self and and safety issues have have occurred the amenities include a barking dog that constantly barks day and night the unsightliness of the property I like an engagement from the owner and the health and safety issues include an unknown airborne chemical that smells and a number of residents have reported having dizzy fits as a result of it unknown chemicals been dispersed into drainage staining of the soil with unknown chemical substance outside of the property there 's a whole range of issues that we 've already gone over from the last council meeting so as I said I raised the rescission because I didn 't feel the council response in that report reflected the 'm hoping that tonight we can rectify the decision of council from its last meeting taken any other characters wish to speak to this counselor mayor you know I asked question obviously this was narrowly defeated last time and with certain reasons so I 'm just wondering if the officers have any ideas on how to improve our relationship with the EPA and if that 's possible that was one of my things I thought that was a bit you know through you mr. mayor the officers had been working with EPA and we had agreed to regular meetings it certainly had opened up the dialogue they have employed a communications manager for this area of of the state and he would seem very committed to continue to work with us to improve any of the glitches or what seems to be hindrances or holdups that might be being experienced so basically if there this goes ahead the report would just reflect that advice that we 've just given that that 's what 's happening I have another question and that is with the existing factories and businesses I mean have we done have we got that information whether all factories and businesses have permits like is that order it necessary so that would require greater definition so for example not every industry in industrial zone requires a planning permit this was in a buffer area so that 's where the requirement came so we would need to sort of define the focus group of which premises fall into the category of requiring a permit and we could check those alternatively it could be a much bigger audit of all businesses and including ones that don 't necessarily need a permit okay because I 'm still opposed to this but on the basis that this could be really labor-intensive and quite costly because that sounds like this but Part B is actually very broad so I think that that either needs to be taken out or reworded as a suggestion to the mover and seconder yeah obviously like I said I voted against this for a reason you know I understand the intent if there 's been one person doing the wrong thing there could be others I think that um I 'm just wondering if there is anyone who has a suggestion for better wording to save me yeah I I have a question to dr. Julian Kay I got sent some information this evening which I emailed on to other counselors the only one didn 't get a test character akin in regards to the cost of this could you outline what the maximum cost would be and what would the minimum cost be if we took up this rescission motion through you mr. mee yes to the best of our ability this relates particularly to 6b and 6e we know that we have 10,000 businesses we think up to about 6,000 may be caught up in this depending on the definition that markup Joe Joe has outlined just previously on that basis and taking a proactive approach to doing audits and inspections at least once a year you 'd need six staff to do that so you 're talking about six hundred thousand dollars per year to do that with a hundred and twenty thousand in vehicles and recurrent of 50,000 maintenance for those vehicles she 'd in the system so you have the capacity to follow up on each inspection that was done where there are issues found sampling costs I 've had advice today from EPA very expensive and they suggested making outs about 150000 equipment costs in the first year for buying laptops monitoring equipment and testing equipment and mobile phones and then some training costs for each of the offices every year as well so the maximum costs would be about 1.1 million dollars for you one and about 888 thereafter to maintain that service but it needs to be pointed out mr. Muir that this is a proactive cost there may be no real issues out there you 're doing annual inspections like we do with food premises whereas at the moment EPA and ourselves actually follow up where complaints are actually made and that 's the difference and the the other the other the other end what was the still doing proactive work but taking about 10 cases a year which would be fairly labor-intensive it to be one aft a hundred thousand a vehicle at 20 plus nine thousand per administrative support you 'd still need the software support with the red flag systems and some recurrent funding there for maintenance sampling costs were reduced to 25,000 recurring equipment cost 25,000 one-off and training costs of about four that all comes to about 240 sorry 234 thousand a year at the first year and a hundred and sixty thousand recurrence thank you catch the Valen question so you mentioned 6000 properties could be caught up in this what you mean by that what without permits we 've got we 've got just over ten thousand businesses and they 're all categorized that comes out of REM plan in economic development you take out categories like um real estate businesses administrative support businesses health allied health businesses etc and you can reduce the number of minute businesses that you might have to go out and do inspections on that takes it down to roughly six thousand businesses so they might be factories manufacturing mining which of which we do have some construction etc and so on that you would actually go and do those inspections on thank you now for Toms do support this as it 's a report however the costs seem to be just going up and up and up and up and I 'm not sure I can support the kind of expenditure that is needed however I understand the intent of the the rescission motion it 's well-meaning and yes there are issues severe issues with the asleep layer situation and really the API needs to be taking more more of a role in a focus and responsibility then counsel and counsel shouldn 't really having be having to take that that role on so I will support this however as it 's a report no money will actually be being spent at this time however my question to officers through you mr. mayor is can a range of different financial options be workshopped high end middle end low end like you just identified with EFT expanded and that 's the money then this will cost counsel and include that into the report because right now all I 'm hearing is this level when there 's probably a few different levels of expenditure that we can use you mr. mee it may be possible but we 'd have to categorize businesses and make selections were at the moment the wording is broad we 'd have to narrow it in a bit more so we can give some range of suggestions and options in the report yes I think that would be helpful as as it is very broad and wide reaching in there are many businesses that would be caught up in this in this precinct in our community so yes I will support it but I have my reservations okay do I have any other characters wish to speak to this if if we can 't come up with some different wording can I move a deferral I 'm not supporting any wording I think we 've heard from the officers they 're happy to workshop it that 's good enough for me can you move I 'm not sure don 't_''_10994.74 we move it to Farrell 's yeah well you can move a procedural motion that you 'd be deferred I 'm left to Farrell moved by Councillor we 'll just go to the Almanac really that the decision is mine but bearing in mind the intent of the rescission which was to be brought up at this meeting I can 't move a deferral because of the intent that the mover and seconder and also the third person that signed of the rescission it would I don 't think it 'd be fair on them to hold it over you just need to if if you if you want to have to vote against it so okay I can 't slow bacon yeah look I think that does need to be clarified and I think that everybody has heard the conversation and so I think we know where we 're going with that one the wording in that particular instance is unfortunate the intent is clear I also have to say that with respect of projected costs we need to keep mind on the subject rather than follow different paths and the fact is that we 've only had this one instance in a long long time where there 's basically been an industry that has had significant impact upon adjoining residents in a 're going to be running around all over the place looking for problems I think that 's I think that 's the base issue of the real intent as far as businesses go I think that probably was an unfortunate inclusion we are dealing in this instance or have been dealing with in this instance with a factory situation and the impact of its activities on nearby residents is very clear and very real there is to my mind and my and I have knowledge probably of three problem areas in that whole Hartnett estate three the other two not as difficult and not as involved as the apps we place one but nonetheless they are having direct impact on residents well-being and the amenity of the area and that will probably need to be addressed aside from this meeting I would think would be the appropriate course so that the the general intent of the motion is quite good and I think as far as improving relations between Council and the EPA goes well I think what really needs to be there is a better communication stream because I into our drainage system and raised by residents to EPA without without it being attended to and that obviously means that we need to have better communication linkages with the EPA and that 's very support that entirely so overall I have no problem with the emotion Thank You character or any other characters wished to speak to this if for no other councillors I will have them something to say I am I got forwarded the information only very late today from dr. Gillian Kay in regards to the cost but the problem I mean the problem is a real cot of real problems over a million dollars one end and and recurrent over eight hundred and eighty thousand if it 's the other end it 's still two hundred thirty four thousand and one hundred and sixty eight thousand recurrent but the problem is the notice of motion the notice of motion is far too complex it 's far too broad and it 's not at all clear and because of that all these costs are going to come up my recommendation would be that you vote against and write out a more simpler motion being more specific in the areas that he wants to be looked at and we all agree about the problems in that very place but this your rescission motion counselor unfortunately it 's just too broad and I would if you went away and you come back with something which was a little more succinct a little more to the point so as we can cost it and be able to run it as a council I 'd have no problem but unfortunately because of that I 'm gonna have to vote against this motion okay so mayor question okay so I think there 's some support for guide and this because it 's just a report even though of the costs but it actually from one numbers four and five that we 're actually saying just go and send letters out so one of them is letters to all residents and ratepayers within the proximity of absolute place which is probably not many then there 's one that says all factories and businesses within close proximity to residential properties be reminded in relation to facing City Council on EPA rules and regulations how many businesses and what is that going to cost because this is saying we 're just going to go and do that and we 're going to do a report so there 's the cost of the report the time of the officers which isn 't going to be massive just to write a report but what is the cost of the mail out which it seems councillors are in some are in support of actually doing right now as this motion stands through you mr. mayor at the moment we don 't actually know we 'll do a and of the city in terms of which areas are have proximity to residential developments and I think it probably is likely to be affordable and not too much of an issue but at the moment I couldn 't be specific okay this is no other Castle Casa Boleyn could you oh they didn 't see you down there your your little hand is so small I didn 't see it I 'm I have to get you I might know that the train was look I 'm supportive of the rescission motion I 'm supportive of of the intent of the motion at the end of the day it 's calling for a report in to the extent that there 's any inconsistency with what 's being asked for then it 's a simple conversation that 's being had between the offices and their and the mover of the motion to to resolve any sort of inconsistencies or any questions that anyone might have I 'm also mindful of the fact that the that we seem to be debating the intention of moving the the next motion and not the rescission itself so that 's that 's something else the the motion the rescission motion as I spoke on at the last meeting effectively is either do-nothing approach by counsel and what we 're really saying is that we want counsel to do more than more than nothing it 's not enough to follow up with the APA we need to be more proactive about that for our community the council 's that attended the community meeting certainly got and therefore I 'll you know support the ward councillors and what their their community members have requested of them so I 've got no issues with anything that 's before us thank you thank you I 'll just read through aspects of the motion so councils are aware what they 're voting on so that first three are the first three recommendations of the original report then it 's asked that they let it be sent to all residents and ratepayers advising them of any updates at 30 days and 90 days so whether there is actually a bah Alan and what the outcome of that challenge made be I think given how long this has been going on for since 2014 that 's a reasonable request there has been another request that a mail out be done to factories and businesses within close proximity to residential properties so a buffer zone be sent out and from what I 've just heard it doesn 't sound like that 's going to be an overly difficult task then there is the requests of the CEO provide a report to Council sure that hopefully this doesn 't happen again and I need to reinforce to councillors how serious this has been this is affected people 's lives it 's affected their the the market value of their homes it 's created consternation between neighbors and businesses it 's been a real terrible scenario if the people have absolutely placed in the surrounding areas so please don 't forget that and if you heard the emotion coming from those voices that we heard at that public meeting you would understand how emotive this is to many of those residents so that 's what we 're asking we 're asking to CEO to go away and come back over a report on perhaps some mechanisms that could be enacted to our to reflect their concerns and finally we ask that the artists number seven which is on the back we ask that the state government take a greater interest in this issue and use this as a case study to ensure that our the EPA is more proactive in the future because in this case in my opinion they failed in their duty award our ward but what I 've done in this motion is attempt to make it broad because this is an issue that shouldn 't just be exclusive to our Lord this should be something that all ward councillors of all wards should be worried about and I don 't want to see a repetition of the absolute place occur in another part of the city the people Frankston don 't deserve that we owe it to our residents in absolute place to bring these issues to the fore which we 've done tonight and I think I 've been as proactive as possible and whatever the report comes back wherever it 's uber expensive or it 's a it 's too complicated so bad but I think we owe it to those residents given how long they 've waited for this problem to be rectified we owe it to them to bring these issues up for consideration okay I 'll pull that to the vote all those in favor counselor Lillian O 'Connor counselor bollam cash for a kin counselor Tom 's okay so mcCormick those against okay so that motion is carried what cost mr. mayor mr. mayor hello the motion has been passed we don 't need those comments okay next motion which is 14.2 national and international accreditation yep I 'll move move cats for Bolam seconded yes secondly character Thomas and the nikah time okay cash was do you wish to debate this I will and for these motions given how later these are my people providing retorts I 'll just get the initial summary this motion I 've put together cheery to the fact that as we know Frankston is still experiencing something of a image problem both internally and externally I 'd love to see the image of Frankston bolstered which is why I 've recommended a number of accreditations that could be put to Franklin 's name to improve the image of Frankston not just externally but also internally what I appreciate about these accreditations is each accreditation has certain expectations and undertakings which I hope that a report back to Council will explore in more detail what I would hope to see from a report is how these accreditations could impact a wider perceptive level of understanding and this could improve this could include branding the city branding itself in a more positive light and also more practical on-the-ground improvement so from that perspective this is why I 've proposed this motion tonight for the for a report to come back and to explore whether all or some or one or none of those accreditations might be worth pursuing okay they 're only out counselors I saw Tom 's yes mr. mayor just briefly I commend the councillor on the organization 's which is chosen for council to perhaps become accredited with they are very good international organization some of them and I am interested to see where this goes the question I have to the officers through you mr. mayor is the cost that has been assigned to this at one year being approximately 1500 what how is that broken down sorry through you mr. Muir that 's not broken down that 's a cost of preparing the report that 's just the report so so what what what do you suspect the costings will come well through you mr. 's about 10,000 a year and there 's quite a lot of organizational change that has to be accommodated yeah that investigation thank you as it 's just a report I will be and okay I will support it but I 'd be interested to see what some of these costs come back as because yes this could be very cost intensive so I support the initiative it 's well-meaning and it is increasingly about the image of Frankston so counselor bottom knows I support increasing the positive image of Frankston so I support the entirely okay counselor Kenyan thanks mr. Manuel this to me I 'm not quite as enthusiastic about any of this this was raised from memory or parts of this motion back in the first term of counsel that I was involved in between 2008 and 2012 and I think get the time counselor Bolam raised some of these organizations as organisations that council should possibly align themselves with I think it 's an absolute waste of time I don 't see any benefit at all in officers preparing a report and the reason I say these organizations will be costly if we 're going to seek accreditation you can 't just you know just write to those organized organizations and send them a check these organizations remember the report that came back to counsel and counsel didn 't adopt it those a few years back as well as a cost there 's a whole heap of conditions that counsel have to meet and from memory Council didn 't support it last time as I said it was between 2008 and 2012 simply because of the cost but at the end of the day who really cares if we 've got World Health Organization safe city accreditation who really cares if we 've got accreditation from Fair Trade Association of Australia New Zealand fair trade council who cares it 's like a Nutella think it 's no tell I have that the Hart Foundation tick of approval big deal the customer need the money to add that I don 't see any benefit in this at all and I think it 's a waste council offices time in even looking at this I can 't support only a report but I can 't support a report coming back to council if ultimately I 'm not going to support any of these Thank You councillor Cunha I can try Achan well I note that whilst councillor Cooney or can 't_''_12105.34 supported and won 't support it I will support it and can support it and I don 't see any reason why anyone shouldn 't because it 's asking for a report investigating the accreditation for the following schemes and as far as I 'm concerned I 'd be very happy if the World Health Organization accredited Frankston as a safe city I 'd also be very happy if the United Nations Children 's Fund UNICEF declared us a child-friendly City and I think personally that to have tags on your city of that nature would bring good esteem and good standing and Frankston has had too many criticisms aimed against it which are very unfair and very uneducated and frequently from people that haven 't even visited the place I think this is it 's got a lot of pluses and I don 't mind the might be involved and at that point in time I would make a balanced decision about the proposals individually but I 'm certainly not going to knock out the opportunity of us knowing better what might be involved in having a better and more prestigious label on our city thank you any other couch casa mayor yes I do remember the first council I was on and councillor Balin did indeed raise I think it was the first two and we decided not to do it because it was going to cost way too much money and I don 't_''_12217.109 unless that 's changed it 's still going to cost too much money I don 't really see what it achieves you know I I know that with white ribbon look I 've had a quite a bit to do with family violence organizations and I know that there have been a number of celebrity sporting people who have gone and become ambassadors or thrown up some money at white ribbon I think even we know that there 's all that scandal with Eddie McGuire I think he had a he made a comment about drowning a female sports reporter or something like that so you know white ribbon let 's you know we 've had counselors I think officers who have been possibly ambassadors in the first council that I was in but I 'm not sure that actually achieves anything all you need is you know all the hard work that we do all you need is some idiot comedian to go and crack a joke like happened when Daryl Taylor was mayor and we were at the Polizzi Road you know we had booked an entire table we paid a fortune to be there and they got up and made a crack about Frank 's and we were furious you know and then you 'll get someone who makes a video it goes on YouTube and goes viral you know and there 's you know a lot of negative stuff which is why we started Frankston TV but it 's so much easier you know for the bad stuff to get out there than the good stuff man I 'm not sure if this really cheese anything have our officers write another report let me tell you why it 's right here in the comments staff are considerably stretched with the number of notices of motions and reports currently being sought this would take considerable research to understand the under ongoing obligations costs impact of required change to meet individual accreditation status and whether there are likely to be any conflicts between the separate accredit patience that 's why I don 't support it thank you any other counselors no other counselors we 'll all them I 'll have a say about this at the end of the day perhaps some we should put in a G that we join the the sono Friendship Association and put that as a G I know that I know that 's not going to happen I can 't believe that 's that we keep getting these notices of motion which are reports which cost us money and we know at the end of the day that when the reports come back as we 've been told by our officers this is going to cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars as far as I know they don 't talk the talk in regards to council expenditure and there would be a lot of money involved in this Sameer a lot of money one aboard I 'm not except a counselor I 'm not accepting your point of order okay I 'm not accepting it if you pursue this I 'll ask you to leave the chamber that 's okay okay stand against the chair can the motion of dissent under 91 removed for the mature because you didn 't adhere to my asked to not move a notice of that you did but I am asking you now to leave the chamber for an hour mr. federico you might want to correct them there in the procedural motion I actually did got the mayor before he got this too late I already I already said to you the person poison I already said to you before that you could leave you are on film mr. mayor I 'll remind you you are on mr. mayor section 88 the chair may remove the chair may order and cause the removal any to comply with the directional cause that so you have to first give the reason why you 're actually asking the council to leave before you then invoke okay well the reason is section 91 I know for motion of dissent mr. me I eyes I said that I wouldn 't accept your point of order and I asked you to desist from doing it you didn 't desist so because of that under the section 88 as well I 'm asking you to leave the chamber well I 'm moving a motion of dissent against you to like no I 'm going to now because yesterday I can do that now you cannot take that away from me I 'm sorry you are on film mr. mayor I will remind you I am moving a motion of dissent against the chamber motion the dissent comes after you leave the chamber it does and I said now I move emotion or dissent against you mr. me you can do that and I 've done it yep I second the motion of dissent mr. Mayer against you okay okay can I the deputy mayor must now undertake a ruling on the motion of dissent move up please state your region-wide berm Asian descent Thank You deputy mayor the reason I have moved the motion of dissent against the mayor of Frankston City is because a councilor of this council called a point of order that point of order was not even heard that councilor did not even get the chain the chance to articulate properly that point of order and the mayor refused to hear it and I believe that a mayor or a chair any responsible person chairing a meeting is reply is required and should rightfully hear what a point of order is before dismissing a person from the room because they fail to stay quiet when they 've been asked to leave in that context thank you can faking please state your response my response to that is I asked the councilor when he moved the point of order not to do so because in my opinion it was moved to disrupt me speaking I asked him not to move that point of order and he refused and Act hopefully sorry there our local law I asked him to withdraw from the meeting I did not want him to move the point of order because it was only just to disrupt my debate thank you I 'll put that to the boat all those in favor of motion of dissent please put your hand up counselor 18 counselor Tom to catch the McCormick 's all those who opposed the motion dissent okay so a corner case the Hampton cash Luke O 'Neill counselor mayor and council overlay the motion did sting no carried okay counselors now I want you to come to order okay and will will continue debate and the debate is on national and international accreditation and I was part of the way through it before I was interrupted in my debate and counselors counselors counselor I just behave I just want you both to just behave okay both of you and unfortunately what happens we get these constant notices of motion that cost our officers time and effort to bring them up only to know at the end of the day the motions going to the previous motion is the same it is very very prohibitive but anyway that 's that 's why counselors I am NOT going to vote for the national and international accreditation because we all know at the end of the day it costs a lot of money and to what benefit for this city this city could spend their money in a lot better ways than accrediting themselves to these organizations monies being spent left right and center here and not enough I can 't being made of it so in my opinion you should vote against it okay now is the the mover has been taken out of the chamber or any other councillors wish to speak to this if not I 'll move the motion all those in favor councillor akin councillor Tom 's do you know a voting on council want me to repeat the motion okay councillor McCormick those against councillor Hampton councillor O 'Connor counts lacunae councillor Sandra mayor Councillor and Michael O 'Reilly that motion is lost okay seafood wetlands well counselor Bolam okay moved by Councillor Aitken i 'll second okay move back catch them mail what dear Oh mate okay Angela 's cat counselors okay just calm down okay catch them I can catch McCormack do you want to talk to this motion yes I will mister me the Seaford wetlands the risen there is a major issue regarding particularly motorbikes motorised vehicles causing major problems for pedestrians in particular as well as the environmental damage that they do on the wetlands when they get in to the area so I think that it is not a bad thing to have a meeting and in fact there hasn 't been a meeting about the wetlands area for a very very long time to discuss the various issues surrounding the wetlands including the anti-social behavior which is in fact the mini bikes that keep emerging I believe unless I 'm wrong Council does not desire to see mini bikes in our public reserves and open spaces and I believe that council has a should have a reasonably strong opinion on the illegal riding of motorized vehicles in areas where pedestrians are walking we have had one resident as some of you would well communications about the mini bike issue in the Seaford area a joint particularly where he is are joining the wetlands I think it 's appropriate it 's reasonable and it 's something that doesn 't cost any money okay cash on a calming yeah this is a calling for a meeting of all of all interested parties it 's not dissimilar to other motions that we 've had before the chamber one that immediately springs to mind just the pines flora and fauna reserve and it 's useful to have these kinds of meetings and to establish relationships and try and improve on practices the meeting that was organized for the pines for and fauna reserve was obviously an area that 's not managed by Frankston council but the safe of wetlands under under the auspice of Frankston council so it makes sense to to act in relation to this matter I can 't see really any reason why anyone would oppose it really it 's calling for a meeting of interested parties and then a report back to Council on the outcomes of the meeting it 's pretty innocuous catch the jr. thanks mister me I suppose it 's fair to to try and articulate to the councillors why I 'm opposed I 'm not opposed at all to having a meeting with Miss Kilkenny the state member for Karen I haven 't got a problem with Melbourne water gallons I haven 't got a problem with Victoria Police going there appears to be issues around anti-social behavior within the Seaford wetlands and that 's sad the Victoria Police are the ones that need to get involved if there 's people who are concerned and residents who are concerned other parties they need to report the issues to Victoria police my basis of opposing this is just a notice of motion that doesn 't need to notice a motion it does not need to be a notice of motion we don 't need to spend Council time deciding whether it 's a good idea to have a meeting with Sonia Kilkenny Melbourne water appropriate representatives of any liaison committees and the Victoria police we don 't need a notice of motion I 'm going to ask a question now compliance and Safety Department have regular meetings with Victoria Police I think it 's every second Monday to talk about any concerns that our city has through you mr. mayor yes that 's correct we have a police liaison meeting every couple of weeks I believe it 's every fortnight on a Monday or Tuesday whatever day it is but every fortnight dr. kay yes that 's correct mr. mayor and councillors that 's the only that 's the reason from opposing this notice of motion and I oppose that the other day at the pre agenda meeting councillor bollam who roses said that he had issues with Sonia Kilkenny not not wishing to meet with him well that 's fine but why why do you need to embroil the council on it why do the council need to say you will meet with the council we don 't need to go down this track go and organize your meeting it 's not a Northwest Ward councils kaolin organising I 'm happy for it again but don 't bring it into the chamber and waste council time on it this any other councillors no other counselors counselor akin used to mind something up yes look I I actually agree probably needn 't have been put in the form of a notice of motion on that basis as councillor Cooney all 's pointed out however the rest your reality is mr. mayor we 've got it here tonight and the proposal is reasonable and I would would think it would be particularly sour if counsel simply voted it down because they they considered it shouldn 't could have been otherwise than a notice of motion I agree it could have been done without a nice motion but to vote it down simply because now it 's on the agenda and with this we 've discussed the matter would be pure Isle to say the least okay I 'll put the motion those in favor councilor lien O 'Connor councillor akin councillor Tom 's and councillor Quinn McCormick those against councillor Hampton councillor Cunha councillor mayor Councillor O 'Reilly I will cast my doubt my casting vote and vote that down so that is lost bill advocacy and this is actually a mr. mayor this is a this is an issue that has been going on so I 'm moving the motion that 's why I can you 've moved it stick in the motion do you both want to debate this yeah okay but on the basis that the Seaford RSL is located on state government owned land and that the Seaford RSL are intending to upgrade its facilities Council is to formally request in conjunction with the Seaford RSL a state member for Karamu the appropriate state member mrs. Sonia call Kenny to provide bonafide or greater clarity on the future of the Seaford RSL at its present site and they do need greater they have been talking about this for a long time it is a it is the source of worry to them I have said to them that politically it would be very unwise I think for any government of any color to remove them or terminate their tenure but that doesn 't change the fact that they are there don 't they don 't feel secure and that issue has been going now for some years to get greater clarity about it so I think it 's fair okay counselor Tom 's I 'll reserve my right this to me councillor Mayer and then counts lakenya i have a question didn 't we approve some works to be done in the past couple of years on see for ourselves about state government taking that land off them through here mr. mee we understand that it 's actually part of the rail reserve and should there be a third way line okay so they 're thinking it 'll be a waste of money to do it if the land is taken off them is that the concern if that land is like what 's happening now where so their legitimate concerns okay let 's think okay can 't look Daniel thanks mr. mee well I 've got bad news again look I understand the safer terrace hills but RSL have been there for a number of years I was going to ask some questions about the rail corridor but dr. Koh 's indicated that the Seaford RSL currently occupy part of the rail reserve the way this with an in conjunction with the Seaford RSL approach the state member for Karen miss Sonya Kilkenny asking her to make sure unless I 'm reading this wrong make sure that into the future the Seaford RSL will be able to say on the land that they 're currently occupying I don 't know how anyone can possibly agree how any member of parliament any council could say with any degree of certainty that yes you can stay there for a number of years because for as long as I 've been on this earth counts state government and interested parties have talked about a third railway line to Melbourne from Frankston it 's my understanding that the Seaford RSL actually we know they occupy the land that 's owned by Vic Trek it 's my understanding that if there was a third line built if and when from Melbourne earth from Frank 's to the Melbourne then it would mean whatever part of the building the Seaford RSL has on that land it would need to be gone so I 'll support this notice of motion but only on clarity because if if a letter sent urgent or asking mr. Kilkenny to consider or to make a commitment to allow our Seaford aerosol to stay there indefinitely then she can 't do that no one 's going to do that so I 'll support this reluctantly but I think in future notices of motion have to be very cleverly worded because this is none clear you asking for clarity and if Sonia Kilkenny comes back and says well sorry you currently have at least 2025 but we might start building that third railway line in 2026 well you know what are we asking for I haven 't got anything further to say any other kind slowish under debate on this custom I 'm just briefly to say I mean look at Franklin Tennis Club classic example like sorry guys yeah you 've got a lease but we 're kicking you off well before that expires because we want to expand the hospital so you know she can say look right now there 's no plans or she might say we we may have plans for the future but this that leave the club they 're still going to be in limbo about what do we you know expand further you know I 'd like to see them stay if that 's where they want to stay obviously why would you put members money into expansion but if it 's all going to get ripped up the reality is you know one can provide that guarantee so I don 't know it 's not going to achieve anything but yeah anyhow well they can 't counselor I just like to say this that the Seaford RSL have already been in talks with councilor with them mr. Kilkenny and they were in talks with her some time ago so really for us to be going into talks again which have already occurred like I can 't see really any sense in it I really don 't we can lend our support to them but but they have already started negotiations with with Kilkenny and like counselors have said there 's no way that any member of parliament can give a guarantee when a section of land has been set aside for day they can 't seem possible but we can always lend our support she 'll ever actually probably change the notice of motion to say that we support the RSL in their attempts to secure tenure I don 't know if someone wants to change the motion that way and then we could I would vote for it lakenya sameera like just to ask a question just to clarify you mentioned that the Seaford RSL and mr. Cole Kenya have been negotiating this for some time well they 've been talking to her about it well if that 's the case it 's not it 's not it 's not in this I wasn 't aware of that so I indicated that I would support this but I 'm not going to yeah not if they 're already in discussions I don 't see any point in council getting involved in it leave it up to the state government in the area so we can support them but we don 't need to right yes carrots I have a question do you know the exact nature of those days no me I don 't but they have been in discussions with them no we don 't we don 't okay any other counselor that 's a good question mr. manna maybe maybe tick best to ask you you were talking about changing the motion to say that we support Seaford ourselves does that mean that we support them staying and not having a third rail line well we support for the tenure that they require but unfortunately if the rail line comes through that tenure will end yeah so we I mean I just would we be in almost accidentally forming a position as saying no we want the ourself to stay rather than having a no because if it seems to be that certain that a third rail way means they 're going to go you 're basically saying no we support the RSL staying which means we don 't support the third rail line so it 's probably better to leave it as it is well okay any other cash flow counselor akin there does need to be greater clarity now I don 't know the nature of they have indicated their concern about the future of their location I don 't know what the nature of those discussions have been I don 't know what the response has been but I do think that a combined approach with counsel expressing a degree of interest would be helpful they are in a bind because they have considered making some significant improvements to the building but there 's always the the concern that at some future stage it may just all be pulled down although may they may be relocated so it is a bind for them it may be that in the discussions at least one of the things that can be asked us for is simply is there any future plan that we don 't know of at all in twenty years time that 's likely where we 're going to be shifted so that at least they 've got something to to deal with then work around and playing with thank you so I 'll put that too though all those in favor councillor Hampton counselor Lillian O 'Connor councillor Aitken councillor Tom 's councillor mayor O 'Reilly that motion is carried I need a mover for an extension of time move councillor akin second Castle of junior all those in favor carried okay nan 2018 seven mo n 17 support Neighborhood House funding coastal McCormack I 'll move in sacred moved by cast McCormick second account of Boland do you cast rakuyo to you to Chrysler 's wish yep okay councillor mcCormick I along with some other councillors have been contacted for support by our neighborhood houses in the municipality the neighborhood houses are looking for support for their campaign to increase their budgeted funding in the in the state government next round of budget proposals they haven 't had an increase in in funding since 2014 under the previous coalition government despite a an election commitment from the current Labour government which has yet to see yet to bear fruit in an average week the Victorian neighbourhood houses provide over 10,000 opportunities for around one hundred and eighty eight thousand people they deliver programs respond to issues such as digital literacy and inclusion supporting disengaged youth unemployment childcare emergency management food security community resilience of new arrivals and refugee communities rural isolation supporting older Victorians they have offender programmes social enterprise development and community connected connectedness obviously we thought increases in in operations over the last four years our neighbourhood houses are struggling to to meet their requirements and continue to to fund themselves into the future they are looking for increases in their in their house coordination program funding an increase in the number of state government funded neighbourhood houses in Victoria there 's around thirty five houses across Victoria that aren 't actually funded at all and and an increase in support for the neighborhood house networks and there is a the community neighborhood house network in korangal Drive which is the the network for the southern region so basically this is just about writing to the Minister requesting that they look at increasing funding for neighborhood houses and also providing some social media coverage of of council 's decision to support neighborhood houses to try and increase their funding it 's a service that they offer that council doesn 't have to offer and you know helps to helps with our like to say something but I 'm mindful of the time yes I think it 's a great motion I wholeheartedly support it I think because of rate capping we haven 't really been increasing the amount of grants that we give to each of the to the neighborhood houses they do amazing work a lot of it 's done on earth you know they run on a smell of an oily rag and there 's a lot of volunteer hours that go into fundraising for them as well and sometimes they 're quite disheartened because they put time into applying for grant opportunities whether it 's for some training and education stuff or whatever and they don 't always get it when it happened to one of ours in our ward and it 's yeah they desperately need some more funding and I think part of the letter should actually state the disadvantage in Frankston and things like domestic violence and all the rest and why Neighborhood House is so important because for places like all Wall Street it 's it 's a lot of people 's second home that we do this thank you very much any other councillors if not Carolyn McCormick 's your honor summer okay I put two they all in favor motion carried unanimously Samir can I move we 're going to close let 's move cats like a Cunha setting to castle mayor all those in favor carried unanimously can I ask the gallery to

basically the grand paid for the whole front window that we 've got here which is enabled us then to look outside and it 's also enabled us to draw customers started off as a one-man band that we now we 've got for turning around always stay up to date with the council website so that 's how we knew about the ground put a years in front in our planning for where we wanted to be the grant enabled us to get it all done really quickly we bought a point-of-sale system we invested a lot of money in training staff our staff had better customer service skills and much better coffee skills we 're for heating in the courtyard and fans to make a more usable space it 's a combination of those three things that really made the business a success in the early days and set ago now we have five local staff members plus Sandra and I plus two juniors as well so we 've been operating for three years producing kombucha on tap as I 'm entity that many claim has wonderful health benefits so our story was we were in the city of Monash and we were looking to relocate there was a couple of councils that we were tossing up but the way that frankston interacted with small business and the grant was the deal clincher for us we could be gone by a forklift and we also bought some equipment that we put into retail outlets I 'll turn over the amount of business that we 're doing is about two to two and a half times what we were doing when the grant is actually given to us back ground by allowing us to have that it 's ranking an extra floor space has allowed us now to interact and get another person who just at the very beginning of their businesses so we 're actually incubating a small business within our space now thing which has launder high bc customers will sell but on the other side is we come across a bit and recycling sinuplasty so the grand illusion able to combine from the shredder the conveyor system so comes through a shredder comes onto a conveyor system thanks case was fantastic it was Kate as an opportunity to put on a couple more extra staff and actually allows us to go forward and instead of doing say one ton of day to do 3-4 times and I get the capacity gallons for the business you know we can keep building now and go forward into a bigger factory more employment is the opportunity for four stars all right we put on extra for it should for five stars now so obviously once we get into the bigger factory will probably great it will probably go a little bit more we are importers and now manufacturers of mauritian products we 've been in this business for about three years we were located in ferntree gully we knew that the business was growing we needed new premises and we thought looked at a huge incentive to move into the grant at the same time get a new location that will add hours to plan for future growth we employ two people in the office three people in the kitchen we have someone out in the warehouse when we receive the grant it was a blessing that we now fail to use that grant money to put something up or start making it work I 've been contracting in learning website since I was 13 wanted to move into an office so I could separate myself from the rest of people working in their pajamas at home making websites the home page graduation grant was for someone like me who is working from home and basically moving from a home business into a permanent building then we got the grant which is awesome we were able to buy equipment so computers were able to spend more money on advertising to boost business to support the new staff and old comfortable putting stuff on permanently so while it 's not the biggest antimony of some people it was a huge amount of money to us and without it it would have long were definitely years we are going to continue the higher staff and grow to our environment basically in Silver Springs from what happens I think if we didn 't get the grant we 'd be in the dark as open up people 's minds as to the laneway activities at frankston basic needs an untouched advantage just of the Holograms and could enjoy if we hadn 't have got the ground it would have taken us years to get to where we are now or where we got through with the grant it would have even been touch-and-go to survive my things because it was difficult the grant just really helped us tick all the boxes with the customers so they had no reasons not to come and there we go we made it without the ground we wouldn 't have actually made that next step as quickly as we did we probably wouldn 't have employed another person by now because we could still be caught up in a space that wouldn 't have been working as well for us so that Grant has made a huge difference today so if it had not been for the fact that we had put the kitchener which was helped by the gaining of the gland we would not have been able to create those employment opportunities that we have been able to create and we are going to continue creating within the kitchen area [Music] you [Music] _"

funding for community projects we did hope to do this in person but with current restrictions with kobe 19 undertaking the online version was our best thing to do in this instance rather than delay considering our community grants i did open up today we have an exciting lineup for presentations tonight which where we hope will provide some clarity and support for anyone looking to source funding for their local community organization but firstly i would like to acknowledge the graph your deodorant one but people as the traditional owners of the land now know we pay our respects to elders past present and emerging and acknowledge their rich culture and connection to country and from this we 'd like to welcome to country video for you now [Music] [Music] the animal shy is on the central

future generations welcome to our country lovely um so just some brief housekeeping for tonight your microphones will be muted during the presentations that we 'll have um we have if you have any questions which we really encourage um during the presentation if you type those into the chat bar um at any time during the night and we 'll refer to those in the q a session towards the end of the forum and just know we will be recording this session to assist others who can 't make our first presentation tonight is ellen white so i 've had the privilege of working with ellen um in the past and there 's a little introduction for those who don 't know who she is um ellen immigrated from scotland in 1991 and lived in melbourne until 1999 taiwanini near wichita or just over the border of ganawara originally a biology and chemistry teacher ellen is passionate about lifelong learning and environmental sustainability which is also is also passionate about the future sustainability of rural areas and um has worked in the community development field for the past 20 years she was first elected as a councillor to the blockchain council in 2008 and recently completed her third term finishing up late last year so ellen is also a graduate graduate and current member of the australian institute of company directors in her other community leadership roles she 's the chair of the north central len a women 's health malley board member and president of the which improvement district landcare group her current role involves assessing grants for the foundation for renewal and regional renewal which is f triple r as many of us would know and working with communities on strategic planning so um ellen is speaking tonight on like what makes a good project an application and give us some insight into what assessment panels would look for in an application too so thank you introduction it 's always a bit daunting when you hear yourself being introduced isn 't it thank you for that i 'll just put my presentation up i know we 're a wee bit time limited so um we don 't want to waste too much time and as you said paul hopefully this will come up now can everyone see the presentation yep not sure why it 's not going to the presentation format but all right there we go yeah um and can i just say that was a a really lovely way to do the welcome to country i think in these days where we can 't all be in the same room and it 's still important to do a welcome to country and congratulations to the gang of irish i 've been putting together such a beautiful um little film clip and with the elders to make sure that that that is something that continues and as paul says i have been working in community development for longer than i care to remember sometimes and i 've written many many grant applications from very small that have attracted hundreds of thousands of dollars and and i 'm happy to share some of my knowledge with you tonight and my as well as writing grant applications i 've also got quite a fair bit of experience in assessing or making decisions about grants as well um in my role with the acv adult community and further education board a few years ago we used to assess grant applications for their local organizations i 've also um done some work with the area consultative committee and with the catchment management authority and as paul says i 'm now with f triple r the foundation for rural and regional renewal and my main job there is assessing grants and so while i 've titled this presentation writing successful grant applications we 'll actually talk about assessment as well and and yes please put your questions into the chat box so that we can come to them later on and i think one of the first things to think about when you are writing a grant application is to take a step back before you even start writing and for something that is actually needed and most funders have to have got a bucket of money and that they have got from hard work from themselves and they want to use it to benefit community groups organizations or individuals and so it 's important for them that um it 's clear that there is a benefit to the community and that a project is is really well thought through before someone gets their their hard-earned cash i suppose and so and don 't write a funding application just because the funding opportunity is there think about the project that you really want to fund and develop that up and then go and look for the right bucket of fund to actually um support your project and and when you are actually developing up that project and we 'll go through this in a wee bit more detail and you know make sure that um you 've brought others in that there 's a few partnerships there and when i say partnerships it could be you know partnership with council or partnership with other funding bodies but it could easily businesses in your own community as well so i guess the most important thing is be strategic when it comes to writing your applications be strategic make sure you know what it is that you want to do why you want to do it how you 're going to do it and so on and so and and and talk to other people about it as well you know for example um let 's say that the activity room in the local neighborhood house is drafty and it 's freezing in winter and roasting in the summer and and every group that comes in to use it mentions that and so it 's important then to perhaps have a discussion with those different groups and those different groups could be your partners each of those groups will have some ideas on how to fix that problem find a solution and it might be someone might want to retrofit someone might want to buy a reverse cycle air conditioning and someone might want to rebuild and so bringing all of those groups together to actually talk about the problem and to about um developing up your project and therefore writing your grant application now there 's there 's lots of funding sources around and and knowing where to look for them is really the key the first one on the list there you 'll see is um ganawara and i know katrina will talk about that later on um but it 's always i think it 's it 's good to look locally before you go too far out because sometimes you might find that there are people businesses and and council perhaps um or other organizations that do have some funding that are willing to help especially if it 's only a small amount that you need you know for example alliance club lions clubs and rotary often do community fundraising so that they can support local organizations so you know have a look at what 's around locally as well as looking at some of those other um funding sources that have listed there um grant guru um and the community grants under grants hubs they have compilations of grants that are open all the time and and you and you can go in and have a look and see what 's available and in your area or in for the specific kind of project that you want or the specific group that you belong to as well and so it 's worthwhile you know if especially if you 've got a big project that might cost 400 000 for example and you might need to look at different sources of funding so it 's worthwhile just keeping your eye open and having a look at some of the the grant opportunities that are around and using those search engines um the f triple r one and you can see the picture of the website there at the bottom of the screen uh they actually have a number of grants that they administer regularly throughout the year and they are targeted many of them are targeted towards specific groups or specific for specific purposes but you 'll see on the bottom left of your screen there you can see that button there that says find the right grant program just by answering a few simple questions you can actually help you to find what you 're looking for and can i say that f triple r and some of those other sites there ha have really great tips on writing and grant applications and um ideas to help you as well as well as what you 're going to get tonight from myself and and the others who will be so before you start um as an assessor but also as a grant writer um i think the very first thing that everyone should do is read the guidelines of that particular grants that you 're applying for and as an assessor there 's nothing worse when i look at a grant and discover that the application for the project that the the person is applying for isn 't eligible you know so it 's obviously that they haven 't read the guidelines that says this is a program to fund small equipment grants for community organizations and what this organization is applying for is actually to build a shed um for a new um community group like a men 's shed or something to store their equipment so writing the grants read the guidelines um if you 're not sure when you read the guidelines if you 've still got some questions there 's usually a contact person listed as well and i would suggest that um being that person whether it 's someone in the local council or if it is someone in an organization like f triple r ring the contact person it starts to build that relationship with them gives them an understanding of what it is that you 're trying to do and then you they can advise you whether well this grant isn 't really for you but here 's another one that is or yes your project is eligible and here 's what you should do so it 's really worthwhile contacting that person if you have the time to do that and you can do that by email or by um telephone whatever you 've you 're more comfortable with the second thing is and i kind of alluded to this is check if your organization is eligible and sometimes grants programs are for specific groups and they might be for status or it might be for sporting groups only or it could be for um specifically for neighborhood houses or so on so you know it is important to make sure that your organization is eligible and it will say that in the guidelines um whether you need to have a an incorporation number an apn or any other specific things and also check if your project is eligible as well as i mentioned before no point in spending hours writing a grant application if your project is just not going to happen there and do the timelines through you so excuse me and for example if you 're applying for a grant to run a comedy show in karang on in the middle of november but the grant isn 't announced until the end of november then there 's no point in applying for that grant because if the grant 's not going to be announced until the end of november your project will have already happened and therefore um you 're ineligible for the funding so make sure that the timelines of when the grant is announced and actually suit the project that you 're actually going to do as well and um check previous grant rounds for inspiration you know sometimes you 've got a great idea but you 're not quite sure how to articulate it or you know you 've got you 've got this issue and you 're not quite sure what the right solution is have a look at previous grant rounds and see what other organizations or people have written and what they 've been successful in doing and and adapt their idea it 's not often that you will be able to take that idea completely you 'll have to adapt it to suit your own community and your own organization in your own area and but it is definitely worthwhile having a we look at um what has gone before and and the kind of things that have been funded before because then uh you 'll know that that 's what the program funding is is going to be used for and when you have opportunities to actually go to workshops like this especially in person but even even using with you from your organization because two heads are better than one four heads are better than two and um different people will take different things out of the information that they 've been provided with but and it will also stimulate ideas in different ways as well so that when you do actually come to brainstorm your ideas and develop up your funding applications it 's not just relying on you on one person to to do all the work you 've actually got other people there who are supporting and helping and that way it 's much easier and it 's much more fun as well because the last thing you want to do is be ground down when you 're doing something like this and it can be wearing and so it 's important that you 're you 're in working with others brainstorming bouncing ideas off each other you know is much easier the more people that you have although i have heard people saying that a committee of 20 is a bit too much so you know be careful how you do manage that as i would say that uh have a think about who 's going to be reading it and as an assessor as a grant assessor and i think it 's very important you know i read it when i 'm when i 'm assessing a grant and i 'm reading it for the first time i think about the organization that 's writing it and try to apply any um judgments that i have to make from a strength-based perspective so that you don 't have to be you don 't you don 't have to be um a professor of english in order to write a good application you just need to be able to tell your story and tell it as well as you can but you do have to make sure that you answer all the questions and um again that also comes back to having other people to help you know two brains are better than one and so on and also um comes back to contacting the funding body themselves if there is a contact person to to help you to write the right things up and write a description of what your project is actually going to be and you only have 50 words to do it make sure you stick to only 50 words or 25 words sometimes you 'll have 300 words and you don 't have to use all 300 words some sometimes less is more as long as you make sure that you include all the important aspects of your project so for example you want to get some money to put new curtains up on the windows in that drafty room you also want to put in a reverse cycle air conditioning when the temperatures are too extreme to cope with and you do want to get some and new floor coverings because the old wooden floor is drafty and you want to put a carpet down so you know make sure that you describe your project with all the different elements in it what you what you 're actually looking for and what you want to do and excuse me um so that the person who 's assessing it the person who 's reading it at the other end this is this is what their problem is describe what your problem is it 's well what is the issue that you 're trying to address you know if someone was to write an application and say um we want to make new curtains buy a carpet and um install a reverse cycle air conditioner i would wonder why do they want to do that but if they had said this is what our issue is this is our problem here is our solution this is what it will cost and you have quotes attached to the application to prove that that 's what it will cost and that is really important part of your application as well and and this is how we 'll do it and you know that that helps to tell the story you keep it simple you can if it 's if it 's more of a community resilience community strengthening type of project you might want to use different words you might want to use the terminology that has been used in the guidelines of the grant application as well to make sure that they 're looking for and but as i said if you keep it simple and tell your story the way as if you 're telling it to you know other people in your own community then that is the best way to go if the assessor needs more information then they will ask for more information so um just quickly to run through that that list there and uh make sure you see who your organization is as well you know who is it supplying and if you 're asked for all those legal things like your abn and tax status and so on make sure that you do actually provide all of that describe what it is that you want to do create a budget now it 's one thing saying that this is how much things will cost but there may be other expenses as well and you may have income from other sources or if it 's an event you may have volunteers who are providing a lot of work a lot of hours and on a volunteer basis but you can cost that in as well there may be venue higher costs so make sure that you have all your income and your expenditure expenditure in your application and at the balance if they don 't balance then that kind of makes your application ineligible because it 's not our job to balance your budget that 's your job to balance your budget so it is important that you do that and again if you 're not clear on how to do that then give the funder a ring and talk to them about that and if you 're asked to provide letters of support demonstrating that um you have partnerships or that there 's a community benefit and that other people in the community are supportive or that someone else is happy to um provide 500 or 10 thousand dollars to the cost of the project then make sure that you have those letters of support and that they are attached to your application if you 're asked to provide quotes make sure you attach them as well annual financial documents if you 're an incorporated organization you 're often asked for your annual accounts goods best practice if you have them and if you don 't have audited financial accounts but you 've got an excel spreadsheet or you know you 've got a new ledger journal that you keep the accounts in then somehow take copies of them and and send them in as well because what the assessor is looking for is that your organization and is actually trading solvent that you do actually and even if you want to get ten dollars in the bank that you 've got no outstanding liabilities and and so on that you are um eligible to apply and yes the strategic plans project plans and communication plans if you 've got plans like that in your organization that support your application you know for example the neighborhood house might have in the strategic plan that they want to upgrade their facilities because of the you know the drafty room that they use for their activities then attaching the strategic plan as a supporting document just once again demonstrates to the assessor that um well this organization has thought about this and this is how they with and so all of those things and will strengthen your application communication plans telling people if it 's an event that you 're having in particular you know if that comedy festival is going to run and can then you need to tell people about it so how are you going to tell them about it social media flyers newspaper adverts and so on radio so you have to make sure that you communicate your communication plan as well and i think it 's also important to include there that you will recognize the funding body as well um now on the f triple r website i did mention that there 's there 's some information as well about um how to apply for grants confirm you 're eligible um and so on and you know that page there hopefully you can see it and if you can take all of those things then that 's the time to actually then go and start writing your grants so gather all your information first of all and sometimes most most grant applications these days are done online and um there to go and get something and then come back start writing an application then you realize you need to go and get something else and so on so if you can read through the guidelines if you can download the application form see what it is that you need to get together before you actually start completing the online application form itself then that will help you and and it will it will mean that the application will um be much easier because it will flow quite easier then it will flow much better much much better then and if it is an online application and make sure if you have to log in that you write down your username and your password and because it 's very difficult for the funding body to continually have to help people to to log into their applications if they if they need to and get into the assessment process itself you know it 's not just a case of i get a grant application and i read it and go yeah that 's a good one and then we go and fund it as you can imagine and you know the first step is validation you are who you say you are your your abn is correct the name of your organization is correct some organizations are sticklers for making sure that you use the the name exactly as it is on the australian business register so for example um the witchy-proof and district landcare group that 's the name of the whole group and but sometimes we call it the witcher-proof landcare group and but if we 're writing funding applications we have to write witcher proof and district land care group so you can look up the australian business register yourself pop in your abn and you will see what the the name linked to you the australian business register is that might sound like why do we have to do that but some organizations want that 's that 's the thing that defines them that 's what some organizations want so just make sure that you are who you say you are and check everything make sure your project is eligible for this particular grant round um sorry that project is eligible for this particular grant round uh then the actual application is read we call it a first read and but we read it through thoroughly and and make sure that it 's clear what it is that you 're looking for and make sure that all your documents are relevant and that all the documents that you 've said that you 've attached are actually there and the documents that we 've asked you to attach are actually there and we also look and see if you 've had any previous grants and if all of those previous grants have had their final reports submitted and their financials acquitted and that is really important important especially for organizations that um and in fact most funding organizations do have to account be accountable to their boards and to the tax office and so on for every penny that they spend so it 's important that um grant recipients acquits their programs and projects and previous grants properly as well and if there are outstanding uh final reports or acquittals you may be asked to complete them before your stage so it 's another thing to check when you are writing a funding application for the first time if you comply with everything there then a recommendation is made to the next stage yes or no and and quite often the assessor is not the person who they 'll make a recommendation but they don 't make the decision and the decision um is made by a panel and so a report is compiled from your grant application using your words as much as possible and all of the information that you 've put in and depending who depending on the size of the grant and so on it might be a list that goes to um the panel or it could be a half page summary that goes to the panel or a full page summary that goes to the panel with a recommendation and who then meets and they decide who the successful grant applicants are now if a grant round has a hundred thousand dollars for that round and they have grant applications that are worth 150 000 then someone has to make a decision about 120 000 worth of um grants then the panel will decide um who does miss out then so if you can make your application stand out from the crowd by having a really good you know title family summary or thought through project and with really good reasons why you should get this money then you 're probably going to be at the top of that list rather than um in the middle or towards the bottom so you want to stand out as much as possible but um just again keeping all the other things in mind as well about eligibility and so on um and if you are unsuccessful always ask for feedback the feedback can be provided in an email so that you don 't forget what they 've said or it may be a phone call but you know take that feedback and use it and for future applications to make sure that um you 're successful the next time and when you 've done all that then you should be successful and be able to start your project hopefully i haven 't run over time thank you no ellen you 've done a done a great job so thank you very much um and i think i took some inspiration there um checking previous grants grant rounds for inspiration i thought that was really good to say telling your story i think is is a really good done thing that stood out for me is how you telling your story that your grant is um you know is a great project that 's going to support a certain community or a certain facility or a certain project i think is really good and just having that supporting information that helps you justify that so that 's yeah that really stood out so thank you very much thank you um so what we 'll do now is move on to our next presentation which um is from katrina thorne so um katrina um most of you um from ganawara may have come across katrina at some point in time in her uh over 10 years with council but to make sure that we 're not unfair to her i 'll give her give a little introduction katrina is our coordinated community partnerships council and has worked for council as i said over 10 years she 's made she 's managed and administered the community grants program for the last eight years um growing up in karan katrina has an appreciation of understanding the importance community groups and clubs can play in a small town environment and is passionate about supporting the community to build confidence and skills combined with their past involvement in the local basketball tennis and netball clubs katrina prides itself in developing partnerships with community groups to help our local area grow and develop so katrina will speak uh now about council 's um community grants from which i said earlier open today um and explain what applicants should think about when applying and common mistakes to avoid um what we 've seen in in previous rounds of council when you 're developing your application so welcome katrina thank you thank you paul um i hope everyone can hear me okay i am going to share my screen as well um and i guess while i do that just to yeah i think hear yourself um introduced to a group of people um but yeah my role uh at council over the years has seen me be able to assist quite a few community groups to seek funding for important projects to them my role is quite exciting too not only do i get to help community members build their projects up and get funding i also have the ability to support the team within the council to apply for uh grants um at state um and federal levels as well uh to deliver really important projects within our community um to see tangible improvements so that 's a really exciting part of my role that i enjoy both i get to sort of see both sides of funding coming into our community and building great things um so in the interest of keeping time i 'll i 'll push on with the application the presentation about um ganawara 's community grants program something that was really reassuring listening to alan speak is a lot of what alan referred to i 'll also be touching on which is relevant to our community grants reassuring for people that are listening that the message is going to be quite consistent about um both what an assessor looks for and how does to structure your grant application is very relevant to our very specific program on community grants so i 'm going to start to just uh describe what the categories are and how much applicants can apply for so council 's community grants program provides three categories we have a community support category a community events category both of which applicants can apply for up to five thousand dollars per application and then we also have a major community projects fund and that um that fund uh is for between 10 000 and one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars in funding the difference being is that the major communities project fund uh focuses on infrastructure projects that are on non-council-owned uh land uh and we can i 'll talk a little bit more about that um as we go through uh so each grant category does have a set of guidelines so i don 't expect you to be able to read what 's on our website as of as of now so you can jump on there and have a look at them at your leisure and read through what is required for each particular category we do really strongly encourage you to read the guidelines before sort of thinking too much about what your project might be just to make sure as alan referenced in her information that your project does align with the particular funding stream that you 're looking to apply for of course once you 've read the guidelines and you 've been able to process that and sort of understand how your project might fit within one of those categories you can come and discuss your project with counselors community engagement team of which i am a part of i 'm available monday to friday here at council or you can email us on the council grants email address and i can respond to you that way whatever 's best suited to yourself we 're here to support your application uh and we can answer your questions um we cannot write your application that 's where our role 've got questions or you 've got queries that you 're not quite sure about please make contact with us and that 's our job here to be able to guide you through that process to feel more encouraged to apply and more confident that your project will fit with our guidelines and then once um you believe you to be eligible and you 've had a chat to us and you 're feeling like that 's what you need to do you can begin your application via the online grants portal which the link is on our website so i 'll just talk to you a little bit about the application process so the community grants program opened today which paul did mention so that um opened as of today and your applications can be submitted right up until midnight on tuesday the 31st of august so we 've got the whole month there where applications and the information is available to apply it is a good idea to start early do your research for example with the major community projects fund one of the essential criteria is that your where your project is based is those landowner permissions can sometimes take a little bit of time to come through so we do encourage for things like that once you 've read the guidelines and you understand what the essential criteria is prioritize a little bit about what you might need to start working on earlier rather than later there is nothing worse than then getting to the end of the submission period and sort of running around trying to gather all your evidence or your essential criteria requirements and not being able to get them in time so strongly encourage you to understand by reading the guidelines what we 're asking for and then addressing that throughout the submission period write your application as though no one knows about your project um so providing detail information evidence and being specific um we do have some help notes on our website as well which um if anyone wants them printed out or anything like that council 's uh staff can help with that but they 're there to actually help guide you as well so if you 're reading form and you 're really just a bit stuck or you 're not sure again you can come and talk to the staff here at council but we do have some help notes there to help prompt you through that process as well review your application or think about your project and how it links with the draft 2021 2025 council plan i will talk a little bit more about the council plan later on but that is a key part of the application process is to make sure it aligns with council 's strategic vision for the next four-year period of time obtaining quotes and evidence and completing your budget making sure your income equals your expenditure and your in-kind income matches up again i 'll go into a little bit more detail about that that is a key part of the application process is ensuring that you 've got all that information in place getting relevant quotes and written pledges if there 's any donated materials equipment time expertise getting all that in writing is really helpful and quite important and then attaching that to your application now to be able to read that but i just wanted to give a little bit of an insight into the essential criteria for each category of our grants um so each category of the three grant program categories that we have they each have an essential criteria that has been outlined there depending on which category you choose to apply for is is what essential criteria you need to meet so making sure you understand which category you are going to apply for is important there um the applications to the community support and the community events category you must meet at least five essential criteria of the eight so reading through those you only need to meet five but they must be met in order for your project your application to proceed to an assessment process applications to the major communities project category must meet all seven so it 's the one on the on the far right there um so that 's a really important one it 's it 's a higher um bucket of money um and the projects there are quite significant so it is stated within the smarty grants portal which i will go into later and i can show you a little bit about how that what that looks like where possible there 's been prompts and hints against all of the essential criteria questions to just help applicants address those criteria and just make you sort of think about what what we 're asking for and how you could potentially answer those questions i 'm just going to run through just a few tips and tricks um based on you know a history with running this program it has as paul mentioned been running now for about eight years um there 's been quite a significant amount of money invested back into our community through this uh program and it 's quite well known now that it 's been running for so long so it is heavily subscribed and it 's very competitive so um we hope that sort of tonight we 're giving people a bit of understanding and bit of confidence to to really structure your applications in a way to ensure that they get noticed and that they 're competitive critical very important and is one of the essential criteria in each category of our grant program make sure your income and your expenditure add up so it sounds like a simple thing but let 's we just need to repeat it and just make sure that you 're going through your figures and at the end of the the form if it doesn 't add up go back and just just check it and make sure you haven 't missed anything or mistyped something is often something that can happen is you know typing away and mistakes can happen there when you 're looking to answer the questions just check the prompts in the application form that will help to assist you to answer those questions and just make sure you read read and re-read it just to make sure that you have answered what the question is actually asking you we really encourage community involvement and partnerships so have you thought about whether there 's ways that other groups can collaborate along with you on your project um are there people out there that think your project 's of support to commit to to showing that they think your project is a great idea and if it 's successful they would be supportive to help it be a success so just think about other groups within in your community that you might be able to reach out to and ask questions a good starting point potentially could be your local progress groups local sporting clubs service groups etc so just yeah keep that in mind evidence uh a good application will provide reputable data to back up sort of what you 're requesting your project to deliver i have noted a couple of suggested websites there i 'm sure there are many more they were just a couple of quick ones that i thought might be helpful just to start having a look at and within those websites you can drill down to specific areas of ganawara so you can look at data relating back to other areas or within ghana itself so they 're just a couple of suggestions to get you started to have a think about what they might be on a big scale of to your particular group club or organization and you can always collect bring those together and put them as evidence in your application being specific is really important i 've got a sentence here the whole community will participate or benefit from this project whilst that 's nice to hear sometimes when you 're trying to be competitive in a grants program that probably won 't cut it we look for a little bit more so who exactly is going to benefit will it be your players will it be your members will it be your board will it be parents you know let 's try and be a bit more specific about who is going to benefit or how the participation is going to be improved or enhanced from your project so just a little bit of a chat about budgets on our website as well as the help notes to support people through their application we do have a budget example um piece of paper there that you can sort of have a look through and understand for the different categories of of grant program what a budget screen there is an example for a five thousand dollar community event or a community support grant application you 'll notice in the income line the first thing we ask for from you is how much do you want or how much do you need to do your project um so you would put in there what you 're after in the column where it says confirmed funding it would always be known because it is what you 're asking um from us so uh that 's that 's sort of there and then the income and the the notes um description section is just there it 's not mandatory but if you want to put anything else in there that helps us understand anything about your budget line item then there 's the ability to do that there so that 's just a bit of an idea and the income you could be having you could have a cash contribution from your own organization which is always good to see in an application to the community grants program that you 're financially committed to contributing to your project we case it is not an essential criteria to financially contribute to your project however it is good to see if there is a financial commitment there other examples of income could be donations or fundraising money from a fundraiser that your club might have done business sponsorship might be a part of that um so yeah any other type of income that you believe will be going towards your project would be great to see listed in your budget in kind contributions um uh yeah uh donations of time or of materials that the person is not expecting a cash payment for so an example that i 've given in that one there is that a volunteer or it could be a qualified painter who happens to be on your committee has uh contributed that he would do 20 hours of painting um and he would provide ideally a letter or you know it could be an email to something in writing to state that he will be providing his time free of charge to for this project uh and then in the expenditure column there you 'll you 'll was seven and a half the expenditure needs to be seven and a half you 'll notice that the in-kind contribution of a thousand dollars in the income is matched with a thousand dollars in the expenditure um so that 's really important there the little screenshot down the bottom of that slide there is a is actually from the smarty grants portal uh i just wanted to put that there to give you a bit of an example of what it looks like when you 're going through your application the total income amount and the total expenditure amount are automatically calculated from the program by whatever you put above that in the budget columns so that highlighted section if that number doesn 't equal zero please go back and look at your figures again because there 's obviously been an error somewhere along the way if your budget is incorrect it immediately unfortunately means that your application would be ineligible and can 't proceed to the assessment process so really really critical that you make sure your numbers add up so once the application period closes on the commence the assessment process an assessment panel is formed and as ellen alluded to in her presentation we do a thorough read-through of all applications and we assess those against the essential criteria once the assessment process has been undertaken uh recommendations are then presented to council for a final decision and then applicants are notified uh usually within eight weeks of your submission so um ideally around october applicants are notified of the outcome of their application successful projects for the community grants program must be completed within 12 months of getting funded so make sure you consider this when you 're applying as ellen mentioned in her presentation as well if the timelines for the community grants program do not align with your project uh it would be an option to reconsider and plan ahead for next year 's program because this is an annual program um or you could seek other funding options um or come and speak to us about other yeah opportunities we might be aware of that could support your your project um we 're trying to really foster a planning ahead approach with it comes out annually and it 's the same time every year so we 're trying to allow for groups to plan ahead and be prepared for when the funding cycle comes and plan for their projects or their events or their activities to happen in cycle with the the funding program if you happen to require an extension of time which you know the last 12 months 18 months has been an example of that where things are out of our control and projects have not been able to be completed extensions can be applied for and they 'll be assessed on on each merit as they come in we will provide you for each successful applicant council will provide information about what you must do now that you 're successful and part of that is um acknowledgment of council support for your project um so through the rebrand of our community grants program this year we have developed a logo and a bit of branding so that will be provided to all successful applicants and all we ask is that that logo and acknowledgement gets put on any can also use those when you 're reporting on your project to showcase that an acquittal template uh is available within your smarty grants portal so once uh successful applicants are known council upload those templates in the in the smarty grants portal so that once your project 's finished you can jump straight back in there fill out all the information on how your project went and submit that back to council and sign off essentially on your project um a bit of a hot tip is about about starting the acquittal process almost at the start of your your time frame so start your evidence collection from the moment you know that you are successful um keep evidence as you go make notes of what you spend your money on um and where it went keep copies of any facebook posts or flyers newsletter mentions and we love photos so we really like to see the photos of your projects um we like to showcase those where we can you know we do an annual report every year and we have a full section dedicated to our community this program so keep photos and all of your evidence but start that process at the start as soon as you know you 're successful it just makes the process a lot easier at the end if you 're not having to backtrack and think of what you did throughout the previous 12 months so what i 'm going to do now is hopefully this will work and i 'm going to click on this link and take you through can you see that paul yep oh no okay hang on oh hang on i think i need to here we go there we go is that working thank you so this is the smarty grants portal so when you click on the link on council 's website this is what you will see so you 'll see here that there are this is our current rounds we have the community events grant community support grant and the major community project fund there 's more information about each category within each of those i 'm just going to walk through i 'll just click on the community support grant for out very similar um it 's just the questions and they 're addressing the essential criteria that is the main difference so this is the next stage here now something to note if you 've not used smarty grants before is that you can start an application in smarty grants and save it and come back to it as you need to more than one person can work on the same application you just need to have the one login so just be mindful of that um communicate to your committee that you intend or that you are applying for a community grant and ensure that the email address that you 're using uh is active and accessed regularly that is how we communicate through for the community grants program uh is through those email addresses that are provided and the the phone numbers that are provided um but any updates regarding your application are sent via email from the smarter grants portal so it 's really important that the email address you provide us is active and accessible quite regularly so this is the the entry platform that you idea about what the program 's all about contact details for us so this is our main email address here and you can contact us at any time on that and of course council 's phone number to call us links to our website so you can see all of the guidelines and the information [Music] as i said you can save your draft application as you go and come back to it as you need to and then what happens when you submit and everything goes through there so what i 'm going to do here is hopefully preview the form here so this is what your application form will look like when you 're actually logged in and go through the process so the first part is about your eligibility a little bit about what to note here is your eligibility criteria here so important that you read and understand that as ellen did mention to you can download a copy of this without actually logging into smartygrant so you can pre-read the information to ensure that you you are eligible and that your project does align with 's something that you can consider doing before you jump in and trying to apply uh if you believe that you are eligible according to all of the information there it 's just a tick box there and here is the essential criteria again that is uh detailed there you 'll then go into um your organization details so this is where if your organization is eligible you would put all of your organization details in here your organization name and then the key contact person that council can communicate with about your application phone numbers and email addresses abn there we do ask for your bank details as part of your application process and this is purely because if you are a successful applicant we do direct debit uh the money straight into your bank account um once it 's been approved so that 's why we asked for the bank account details straight away this next page here is not relevant for many but if you happen to be an organization that uses an auspice or another organization for the purposes of applying for a grant this page not an eligible organization but you have someone who can support you that 's where it 's exactly the same details as the previous page but it 's just letting us know that you 're using an auspice for your application so it 's the same same setup there and then the next page here this is all of the project details so this is what you 're going to tell us about your project we ask for project name we do ask it to be short but descriptive an example there blacktown dancehall painting project lets us know what you 're doing and where you 're doing it we do ask for a project summary we give you 150 words so a bit more than 25 a bit less than 300 so it 's a nice in the middle number there again we 're looking for a short description but we need to understand from the summary pretty clearly what you intend to do um so yeah try and be pretty descriptive in that 150 words if you can when you anticipate to start and finish your project again but being mindful that it must be completed within 12 months so prior to for this particular round prior to 21st of october next year and then yeah so it 's just working through i guess i just wanted to give you a visual of what if you have not been into this mardi gras program before for our community grants program just to give you a visual of what it looks like what the expectation is so a lot of those questions there are just tick box choices based on that and then we go here into our essential criteria so as you can see i mentioned before that under each of the essential criteria where possible we have provided little prompts or suggestions or little hints here um about how to answer those questions so hopefully they provide a little bit of support or clarity around what we might be looking for again read the question and then read it again it helps to sort of absorb that information and understand what and relate it back to your project so that 's the essential criteria all the way opportunity to provide letters of support if you have them or other evidence-based documents that you 'd like to attach there you can upload up to five files in this section um the budget section is the next part so the first thing we want to know is how much you are asking for and then how much you you think or how much you 've budgeted your total project to cost and then this is a little bit of information down here around around how to fill out the budgets and examples of what you could put in the income and the expenditure column a bit of an explanation as to the different types as we spoke about a little bit earlier these are drop down lists here so when you go into the actual form you 'll click on those and it can give you the income types this one 's got a red asterisk on it because at the very least we do need to know from the grant program how much you want so at the very least you 'll have one line item in there and then the expenditure table is there underneath again we 've got examples of what you could put in there examples of what can 't_''_3810.0 be funded as part of this particular category so just be mindful of that again a link to the guidelines if you need to be reminded there and again there must be at least one line item detailing what you 're going to spend the grant funding on this is the bit that i was speaking about earlier here um so this column here this area here and this area here are automatically calculated based on what 's been put up above so then if this area here has anything other than a zero in it there 's been an error made so just be sure to go back and have a look at what you 've put into your tables and then this area here down the bottom is where you can upload quotes um or evidence of in-kind contributions towards your project the last page then is a bit of a certification and feedback has to be signed off by someone from your quick feedback section there around how you found the application process to be anything you see marked with a red asterisk is a required field and you won 't be able to progress through the application unless that has been completed so that 's what those those ones mean there if i close that it 'll take you back there um i 'm just going to go back to this one here for you um so in closing i just wanted to reiterate the the key sort of messages i guess from council around our community grants program read the guidelines please call us if you have any questions about your project um that is going to say ask questions i apologize that 's a typo start your application early so applications opened today and they open all the way through until midnight on the 31st of august but i do encourage you to to get into the approach of the portal read the guidelines have a look at what the application form looks like and be familiar with it a tip i like to sort of suggest to some you know that your project is eligible um and your organization is eligible get into the portal and at least fill out those first two to three pages where it 's all about your organization so your organization name address phone numbers the emails all that contact detail and then you left and you can really focus on what you want to tell us about your project and your budget include your evidence so start that sooner rather than later particularly if you 're needing letters from people allow time for those to be uh included be specific with what you 're telling us about your project so that we truly understand what it is you 're trying to do and why and ensure your committee your group or your organization is aware of your application whether that 's a quick email out to your committee or you 've got your private facebook groups or what have you whatever your communication means are i think it goes a long way to just making sure that your committee is on board to understand that you 're applying for this grant it the same committee applying for the same program which has happened before so just that um open communication with your committee or your group about what you 're applying for and who 's going to be involved in developing that application and that 's that 's it for me and i hopefully that 's provided a bit of clarity on our community grants program and um you know where we are if you need to ask any questions thanks paul thanks katrina that was really informative and i had you down for 7.40 to finish so you 're right on well done um a couple of points i took away from your presentation too which was fantastic was um it is an annual it is an annual program so it 's all about the planning um there is obviously a number of um grants and the funding available there you 've given us a heap of information about what you 're looking for in the applications a lot of hot tips so well done and i think um the other point is all of these guidelines tips um and smiley um you should be able to access anything there that you need but um as katrina said um probably an email or phone call away as well so thank you very much katrina um we were planning on a third presenter tonight but um unfortunately stephen o 'donoghue won 't be presenting tonight um i thank him for his early commitment to support this forum and we hope to facilitate an opportunity in the future where we can share his funding success stories because um he 's got some great stories to share um overall there 's been a lot of information provided to you all tonight and quite consistent um on my dad between ellen and katrina um now is the opportunity to ask questions i know we don 't have any questions in the chat as of yet um uh so please jump in and type some of you if you uh do have any i 've got a couple to start the ball roll um uh might start with uh trina um do his councils ellen went through quite a list of assessment um steps that the similar to that instead that step by step that ellen outlined yes good question uh it is so councils once uh the applications uh come in in the deadline sorry that 's um it 's finished yes so we do a thorough read-through of all the applications and then the essential criteria is assessed um it 's it 's weighted so the assessment panels for each category will go against those essential criteria and weight them against um that assessment process which will then allow us to develop some recommendations based on that so it is a very similar process yes thank you um ellen if you can answer one for me that 'd be great um how do you um and this is probably not from an assessor point of view but from someone that 's been that 's been in community development how do you um feel about when your grant isn 't successful um and i get how do you go about um moving forward from that to do you access another grant or do you use you know feedback was mentioned um in your presentation but in your experience um yeah look i 've been successful in a lot of grant applications but i 've also been unsuccessful as well and you know it it does leave you feeling a little bit despondent but i i did mention earlier it 's important to get feedback you know where did you go wrong in your application you know did did you not describe your project properly were you asking for too much money where was there just such a volume and and your project was very similar to 10 others in the same area and therefore um you know they couldn 't fund all of them you know sometimes it 's just bad luck and other times there 's some really valid reasons so asking for the feedback on why you were unsuccessful i think is the first step and the second step is then going back to your committee and explaining why the grant application was unsuccessful and looking at whether um it 's something that they want to pursue and then go and look for other funding buckets of money that might be around or next round that opens up which could be in three months six months or 12 months time so it really depends on your application as well as um what you 're actually applying for so the feedback might also be about the eligibility of your projects as well maybe it was just the wrong funding round that you applied in and so you know applying to a different grant ground might be um useful you know and some of the the grant applications that i 've been assessing recently are um you know for community resilience type projects and um some of them have been in bushfire areas so there 's a separate bucket of money for communities that are in bushfire areas so we 've been able to work with the applicants and move their application across to you know a grant program that 's specifically for them and is going to help them and that leaves um more opportunities for another group to move in there so sometimes it 's you know i think one of the other things that i said as well paul was about talking can find out you know is this the right bucket of money that i 'm applying and and should it be somewhere else so a whole lot of reasons within their pulse sorry about that but you know i think getting your feedback first of all is is the important thing great thank you ellen i might ask you one more question too if i can as you can people you 're welcome to jump in with the question if you do have any i know there has been a lot of information so it might be just taking it all in but how you talked about being strategic at the start i think in your first slide how much does strategic planning help to support the process um when you 're seeking funding yeah and like having a plan um is really important and if your organization has the strategic plan you know um then use that strategic plan to support your application katrina also mentioned you know the council plan and so on and it is important that um you look at what is in your strategic plan in your strategic plan of your organization and that 's what you should be working on and therefore um if you 're applying for funding for a project that has got nothing to do with any of the strategies in your plan then why are you applying for it so how is it going to benefit your organization so you know the the assessor might go well where did this project come from it 's kind of out of the blue and it 's not related to anything so having your strategic plan is really good because it shows how your project does relate or it should relate and in that respect and and the assessor whether it 's council or somebody else is is um looking for that evidence katrina also mentioned evidence and yes we do have evidence whether it 's statistics or a strategic plan or a a project plan and that that is evidence that shows there 's a need for the project the committee have thought about it and they all agree to it and and that there is defined community benefit specific community benefit we 've got a question on the chat so thanks elise um katrina um there 's a question just about aligning um with the goals on the 2021-25 council plan which i know is in draft at the minute but yep hopefully it 'll be adopted soon yes yep thank you elise that 's a really great question and one that is quite common when we 're going through uh the application um process with the community grants program so as paul alluded to it is in draft format at the moment but the the goals of the council plan um there 's three uh they are livability growth and sustainability and essentially what we 're looking for when we 're stating that we like applications or projects to align with the goals of the of the strategic direction of council is to just ensure that things that the community grants program are funding are going to support those high-level strategic areas that we see ganawara are aiming for into the future so when we talk about for example um and link links i can say links to the all we refer to are all within the smartie grants portal so you can connect straight into to have a look at the the draft version of what the plan is at the moment and understand sort of uh the layout of it and what it what it looks like and what it might mean um so the livability goal for example is about enhancing the well-being and livability of of ganawara that could be through creative infrastructure and services so that that goal uh connects back to community health and well-being and livability of our area so if your project is about enhancing that sort of area that could be around facility improvements for example to make sure that the community has access to two nice services or nice buildings or nice areas to to undertake whatever activity you might be looking to do growth is around growing the ganawara through a diverse and broad economy and then we 've got sustainability which is around long-term financial and environmental sustainability so your projects could link in with that in a number of different ways we 've given a few examples main takeaway i guess would be to ensure you just look at council 's website or have a look at those links that take you to some of our strategic plans that we refer to through the application guidelines just to understand that there is a connection between that high-level strategic place that the council works on delivering to and how that can relate down to on the ground execution of events or activities or programs that our community are seeking to deliver to enhance whatever area of the community they might be involved in um [Music] if that hasn 't quite answered your question at least i 'm more than happy to take it offline and i can elaborate with you one-on-one if you 've got a particular project in mind but essentially it 's about understanding that that things that we 're looking for the community deliver will in some way connect up to that high level strategic plan um of council right thank you katrina um i 've just got one question for you too um the there would have there may be some people online tonight um how much funding do you um does council give out in this funding and um yeah do we do we we tend to get a few a bit more than uh over subscribed i get than what we normally have so what are we looking at that might help people understand the context of you know something you said not because we don 't have a good project because there 's just enough money absolutely um and alan mentioned that just before um so for some context um i believe off the top of my head paul i haven 't got the figures in front of me but off the top of my head the last round of the major community projects fund um so the the the bucket of money for one of a better word is 250 000 in our annual budget for that program and i believe the last round we received just under 1 million worth of applications heavily oversubscribed many many great projects were submitted it simply came down to the fact that there was not enough money in that that allocation to be is um always every year heavily oversubscribed we often have in excess of 20 applications to the community grants to the community support um category um and um overall the community grant the community support and event um categories have i think it 's about 84 000 um to support um applicants and we always far exceed that 84 000 allocation so to give a bit of context that 's why it 's so important to really plan your projects and really communicate to us what they are and why you want to do them and what benefit they 're going to have to the community to really make them stand out and and justify the investment from the community grants program great thanks katrina um as we don 't have any more questions we might um i think finish up so in closing out the forum i just want to thank those who have helped pull this evening together including katrina and denise frizzo at council there 's been a considerable amount of um uh time to enable this event to occur uh even online one such as this and participated in the forum um this evening um it takes your attendance and contributions to make these nicer success and this is our first one and um we hope to do them on an annual basis um as well and finally thanks to our presenters um tikki ellen um your experience um in this space um and i guess it 's inspiring and opportunity to understand how it all works in the back end often um but obviously your community experience as well really um gives us some context into how a project can be formed so um thank you all again and um best of luck with um with your future funding rounds but um as katrina said council um you can touch base on grants again gsa.vic.gov_._4903.719 iu email us and if there 's anything else we can help you with very happy to help so thank you all for coming thank you paul thank you katrina bye everyone _"

kanina can catch up um so i 'd like to start tonight by acknowledging that i am broadcasting from beautiful traditional lands of the grundy tomorrow people um i 'd like to pay my respects to the elders and past and present and their emerging leaders and acknowledge the deep connection the aboriginal people had and still have with gundy tomorrow country that we are broadcasting from tonight kanina is here tonight talking about her newest novel all we have is now and kanina can we hear you now can you hear me now i can hear you now [Music] so uh welcome she started television production at um she went on to work in television including roles as a script assistant on all saints which was one of my favorite shows at the time a storyline on headland and a script writer on home and away since becoming a mother she 's turned her attention to fiction writing for the better for us writing boot camp coffee chocolate and champagne are just some of kanina 's favorite things and ellie is here celebrating her newest novel called the code breakers ali is an adventurer at heart and has won multiple awards for her riding she 's lived in lots of different places including argentina peru and canada and has climbed some of the world 's highest mountains worked as a tour guide in south and central america and it 's traveled the globe not at the moment though i 'm guessing ally no she enjoys immersing herself in exotic destinations cultures and languages but australia has always been close to ellie 's heart so kanina we might start with you and i have got your books here so your newest book and i 'm just going to have is now is your newest novel can you tell us a little bit about the story and what inspired you to write that one yes thank you tinia thanks for having us on tonight ali and i 've done one of these before and it 's lots of fun doing it with another author um so all we have is now yes is my second book and it is about three women who run a wellness center together so we 've got um a nutritionist a counsellor and um a nutrition sorry yeah and a nutritionist it 's been a little while since i 've talked about it but they they run a place um a home as a like a federation house which they welcome locals into their um sorry i 'm hearing myself back now um my audio is just not doing it tonight um so they they they offer health and well-being and recovery and peace a really nice place to go and kind of get your self balanced and they just want to help people and they 've come together they 've been friends for other and their first it opens up with them looking at a new location for their business because they 've been expanding and they find the perfect place only that they 've got one too many rooms and financially they 're going to have to get someone else in and so the person that walks into their story or into their world is tom who is uh a secret from olive 's past uh no one knows what he 's hiding um and oliver 's scared that everything that she 's been uh you know building her life upon 's all gonna come falling to pieces so the inspiration of why i wanted to write something like that was basically i think the first the first gut instinct to do something about a wellness center was that i was craving that as a writer my debut which was the one and that was its original cover uh it it was about reality television and behind the scenes of tv and at times it could be a bit spotlighty and catty um that fast-paced i think i was craving to go kinder and gentle and i wanted to explore all those different things so i think that 's what originally kick-started the idea um at the time that i started writing it i was my youngest was at preschool which was half an hour away but it would be an hour round trip so i used to go to my local library which is midcoast libraries and i would do some research there so i was looking through lots of wellness magazines and for story inspiration and i think it all just kind of blossomed from there yeah wonderful and ali um your newest novel and i 'll just grab it it 's called the code breakers let 's hold it back so you can see sorry with my background obviously a novel at the background so novice at the backgrounds um can you tell us a little bit about that one and what inspired you to write it because a little bit of a different setting to kaninas yeah just a little bit yeah different getting different era it probably couldn 't be two two different books there um so co-breakers in brisbane in world war ii um i imagine you know most people probably heard about bletchley park in the uk so central sorry i 'm just thinking why i start talking in the dog bath sorry it 's okay i 've got a dog here too and i 'm sorry she 's gonna start barking it 'll be some bird that dares to be in our front yard um so um so central bureau is uh the organization in brisbane and it 's located in a leafy suburb um ascot i don 't know if anyone is familiar with brisbane but it 's a beautiful old neighborhood gorgeous trees and whatnot so the men work in a mansion and the women work in the garage at the back of the property and they call themselves the garage girls so they totally own it um and their job is to encode and decode messages that go to places like bletchley park or in the usa there was arlington hall um also communications between all the you know allied outposts all over the world um part of their job was been intercepted and um making sure that those messages went off into all the right the right places so the inspiration um came from a google search so i know crazy so um i had written a book in 2018 called burning fields and it was set in post war queensland and my main character worked for the australian women 's army service in brisbane and i really liked the idea of actually visiting a story set during world war ii and exploring the kind of jobs that the women did back then um because you know obviously there was a shortage of men a lot of them were overseas so women actually had a chance to do all kinds of different roles uh so i just did women world war ii brisbane this really really tiny article popped up about a woman who worked in brisbane for central bureau and she was a co-breaker like i didn 't even know we had co-breakers here so the research for me went okay i need to know more so it was probably two years of pretty solid research and i managed stories being able to ask lots of different questions um you know about what it was like to keep a secret for nearly six decades because of the kind of nature of their work that they did um they had to sign the official hypocrites act so they had to live with you know pretty much a double life and not ever tell their family and friends so being able to talk to them was really helpful um in terms of um you know understanding what it was like and um and and that was yeah so their stories kind of helped inspired inspire this particular story which follows ellie um who she 's our main character and we kind of go on her journey throughout her lifetime yeah yeah what an inspiring story it is um both of these novels i really enjoyed um and they both explore really important issues in relation to women that are not always talked about um can you tell us a little more without any spoilers can tell us a little bit more about including those sort of themes and and stories in to tell these stories that aren 't always talked about well i think most of the there 's a few big issues in within my book one of them that is pretty obvious from the get-go is this alzheimer 's storyline and that is not a spoiler but it 's something that my grandmother when i was only about seven or eight um was diagnosed with alzheimer 's and so for that i think it had been coming on for quite a long time um that they had all noticed but as a child i probably wasn 't privy to any of that but so she went from walking around and then was hospitalized the next day and then spent the next five years in a nursing home and so most of my memories are of her in a nursing home and i think that 's just something that has always kind of really stayed with me and i do remember the impact that it um had on especially my mum but all her siblings and my grandfather so i think that that was something that i wanted to explore but how it impacts everyone 's relationships and the you know the challenges they face with that there 's other elements within my story that a pretty big issues but they aren 't really talked about and i just don 't want to give it away as a spoiler however the inspiration for that was that um i had several close friends over a period of about five years go through really heartbreaking experiences um each of them were a little bit different everyone dealt with it completely differently i always felt quite helpless and didn 't you know wanted to say the right thing wasn 't sure what the right thing was and maybe the right thing for one person isn 't the right thing for another um so i just really wanted to explore that and honor what they had been through in the experience and i hope that when people are reading the book it kind of allows um a dialogue to open up about it and for it to be a topic that isn 't so taboo and i 'm really sorry that i 'm speaking things i really wanted to explore with all we have is now is friendship and how friendship can get you through um hard times and dark times and house friendship isn 't always necessarily easy sometimes you 're a little bit clueless you don 't know how to support certain friends sometimes your friends aren 't doing what you want them to do or expect them to do and i felt like i i placed a lot of value in friendship and i want to be a great friend to my friends and after i wrote the one even though i had three female characters they weren 't in a friendship relationship so it wasn 't friendship wasn 't something i really explored in the one they had their separate storylines that um that i 've interacted but not like true friends and i think that that 's really something special especially within a workplace so a workplace can allow great friendship but you can also put up different barriers you can tell them what you want to tell them what you don 't want to tell them so i i had a yeah i had a really great time exploring all the issues and you know you spend all these time with these women that you 've made up but you feel like they 're real which is just such a surreal experience and to have people read about them and feel that they 're real too is you know such an honor yeah i definitely um that friendship line i 'm definitely related to a lot of that um very relatable in as far as like you say working with your work friends you often have different relationships with work friends as opposed to very close long-term friends but they 're still as important to you in your life every day so especially when you spend so many hours of each of your days wisdom yeah so yeah some people would spend more time with their work colleagues and friends than they would with family members so it 's just yeah for sure and ellie there 's some pretty there 's there 's a lot of really important issues in your novel and you 've touched on some just just tell us why that 's so important to you to share these stories ah yeah well actually friendship funnily enough is another thing we 're leaving with that one yeah um you know i think you know anyone who 's uh you know had an intense experience um you know whether it 's you know traveling or work or you know where you know you you 're with with a group of people for a certain amount of time or or a specific event that the friendships can become really intense um and and also very important in your life um so i wanted to explore friendship between the women who worked for central bureau because they lived and worked with each other actually lived in an army barracks and term side and then they worked in in ascot um and the kind of friendships that they had they really only could rely on each other because they knew they knew what each everyone was doing so you know they they knew the kind of secrets that they had had to hold on to they knew the pressure family and friends and so they really supported each other quite a lot during the war but then after the war they all went their separate ways and it was really interesting like to see how the friendships um pretty much disintegrated because a lot of the women couldn 't cope with keeping secrets and so um even though these friendships were really dear to them they found it really difficult to maintain them and then we sort of over the years find out what what happens you know when they see each other um but i also wanted to explore women working non-traditional roles um during the war um our main character ellie she starts out working as an engineer for qantas um her her passion has always been planes but because she was a female never had the opportunity um her dad was a pilot with qantas in in rural queensland um so it was a passion but she didn 't get that chance until world war ii and she was really she 's really conflicted because she 's finally getting to live out her dream by working with planes is because the world 's you know in the middle of another war so um she kind of battles with that quite a quite a bit um and then after the war you know i mean these women you know dealt with some of the biggest secrets that australia 's ever seen um and then they 're expected to go back to the kitchen and you know they 're privy to some of the biggest secrets out there uh and then the war 's over and then it 's like okay see you girls yo go have family so my character is quite ambitious so she struggles a lot with that and ends up painting her own way um and i used a lot of really great australian women as inspiration um for my main character you know women who have paved their way in the aeronautical field um in lots of different areas um so it was really nice to actually be able to um i guess you know use real life stories as inspiration um behind my character and and give readers a chance to learn we 've never heard of before yeah absolutely for sure so as i 've mentioned i love the strengths of your female characters in both of your novels they 're really really strong and often following their own paths and and but relying on each other for friendship as well so did you have an affinity with any particular character in your novel and and why was that and and kanina that might be asking you to achieve a favorite three characters there which is probably nearly as bad as choosing your favorite child i imagine i 've got three children actually they 're all the favorite when they do the right thing [Music] i now yeah as i said they 're like they 're all my they feel like they 're all you really good friends but i think i did have a a bit more of an affinity with olive yeah um but that 's also i think it 's linked to i wrote a short story um a couple of years prior to writing um what we have is now and it was published in the underdog 's 12 short stories for young adults and they none of us at the time had been published so this was my first publishing excitement so that was a huge deal and the um and the story is involving olive so i took i somewhere along the way i decided when i was creating what we have is now that the character of olive who is very particular about things um like likes to be in control and likes to be everything to be ordered um is kind of quite judgmental uh she wants to be helpful all the time but she 's also quite secretive i just felt like i really knew exactly who she was she 's also craving to be liked and craving to be craving to be someone that she 's not neces that she isn 't but she just can 't_''_1219.76 so she can see how other people are really likable but she can 't let herself be more free or um yeah so she 's there 's a few moments within the books that she keeps watching how easy going brees one of the would like to be like that but you know she 's someone that when she 's really stressed she just cleans every surface and she um you know tidies everything and does accounting for fun and but i could just really get into her her headspace um she 's a really good business woman and she is definitely successful um but it 's something happened in her life so this is this is what i imagined is her backup career and this isn 't what she was going to set out to do all along um but that kind of comes clear within the pages of the book so even though i wouldn 't say i have a favorite i felt like i knew her really well i knew her voice and a way that i 've described it before was that um there 's something there 's line in there about her not wanting to wear her slippers outside and my sister sent me a message and said is olive based on me because she 's a little bit like this and i said no she 's gonna use i don 't wear my slippers outside either and i just i think it 's a really great way to think about it because then i thought about well bree bree would probably wear her ugg boots which i have said before through like wet grass whilst elsie probably doesn 't even own slippers you probably like you 're someone that pulls socks on so it 's just like i think just getting into their different headspaces and knowing who they are and how they move and what they like and what they don 't like but i i definitely always instinctively instinctively i think i said that i know what you can say instinctively um knew what oliver 's gonna do yeah yeah it 's interesting how with how much to me who 's not a writer um how much detail you think about the characters when you 're talking about them in that way i know because they 're real up here yeah yeah absolutely and ally who 's your who 's your favorite do we have to ask or um listen i love mrs hanley mrs hanley was going to be not even a secondary character like a thirdly or fourthly character i know there 's no such word is that but anyway um so mrs hanley owns the boarding house that ellie stays in um and mrs hanley until she goes to the barracks and is you know recruited but this is how many features throughout the book and she came really she came fully formed um mrs hanley is i guess she 's just she 's the glue for a lot of the characters in the story um she has a thing where she will take him straight on a sunday so she has a sunday roast and she makes it a point of um you know meeting a young soldier and you know inviting him in for a home-cooked meal um and so how to yeah gosh i interviewed so many so many people not just people from central bureau but i remember someone i think it was a gentleman at the macarthur museum in brisbane and he was telling me about how his mum used to do that during the war and i to mrs hanley to do that um and uh you know she mrs hanley also baked sympathy scones so you know if there was a neighbor who lost her husband in the war then what she would do is she you know take the kid in and and you know while the mum was you know sort of trying to figure out what to do next and get over the shock of the news um you know she 'd get the kids in and then make scones and then take them away into the neighborhood and and those sorts of things and so mrs hanley 's really definitely the glue for a lot of the characters um she 's lost her own sons in the war um she lost her husband as well just as world war ii broke out um and so she 's had a lot of loss in her life but she still has so much to give and it 's that giving that actually keeps her going um it gives her a sense of purpose and it makes her feel like she can um you know know that she 's lost you know um so yeah so mrs hanley definitely um surprised me that she got as much airtime as she did but she deserved it because she 's a really everyone needs to mrs henley in their life i definitely agree with that and it 's funny you say that ellie because mrs hanley as soon as she appeared in the novel and she was in her kitchen making out i could picture her instantly in my head or have a picture in my head instantly of what she might have looked like much what she might have been wearing and even to the the smell of the kitchen because i want to talk to myself i love baking and cooking so i could kind of put myself there so yeah i think she 's probably one of my favorite characters in your book as well oh good there you go so for both of you can you give us an insight into setting your base three novels like do you always have a particular setting in mind when you write or does it sort process of planning for a new novel you should start that one ally you 've written way more books than me oh gosh i guess by my bye i 'm i 'm definitely i 'm a traveler at heart so my first three books um get them right linda tango under the spanish stars and um beneath the parisian skies what happens if you get the titles when you 've written that many oh no characters it 's terrible it was like me saying just like you 're right yeah you write it and then you move on so don 't tell my characters i forget them um so they 're my what i call my armchair fiction um stories so you know they they 're set in you know argentina spain and and france um and uh yeah i mean i love writing i i love writing stories set in in different destinations um and yeah finally i just can 't help myself that 's just the i guess the nomad in me um but i guess in the code breakers was a little bit different because um obviously actually happened in um but i always the next two are definitely a destination type novels as well so that 's good yeah it 's just i 'm gonna have some variety yeah absolutely and look you know if we can 't actually jump on a plane right now i 'll just do it on the pages i like that philosophy what about you kanina do you always have a setting in mind when you write write your novels or think about writing well my setting for the one was very tv based and my with my background in tv i felt like it was a world that i knew um the tv set so to speak and what happens in location so that was the basis for it however i 'm definitely not as game as ally but i haven 't traveled as i did around the world trip for a year but then other than that haven 't really ventured to a place that i feel confident enough to write explicitly about so my locations so far are pretty much an hour from my hometown i 've in is an hour north i go into gloucester which is an hour inland um and then in all we have is now i went to wingham which is about half an hour from where i live so all locals love the local references they really appreciate um the little place like the name drops of different cafes or the hospital or um different landmarks they all really appreciate that but i i think it 's more to do with my confidence level of well i know that place um wingham is a really beautiful country town and it embraces alternative and um they 're into health and well-being they 've got lots of healthy cafes and um you know they have a busker 's day where everyone 's on the street busking and um yeah i felt like healing hands which is my fictional wellness center would be a place that you would see in wingham so it was a believable location for me but yes um the manuscript that i 've just finished i i did go further afield to sydney and um and a few other locations too more adventurous might go out of the state next time if we can right now [Music] but you 're right kareena people love it when they read a book and they can recognize the setting that you 're in or if you 've used a cafe name that 's really similar to the actual cafe um and um i guess maybe they probably look for themselves in the characters a little bit then as well well i had a really lovely experience that um for my local book launch three local businesses it was uh two different cafes and one in wingham and one that 's on the beach that they went to they donated gift vouchers um like for lucky door prizes and soju there 's uh they go to a maze um which is a real place too and they donated a voucher so it was really lovely that they all looked but all the owners got a great you know thrill out of being in the book and said that they 'd lovely love to donate a prize that 's fabulous yeah that was a bit of little bit about the research in your book ally and um i 'm just wondering what type of research in bit more detail do you do either of you when writing a book like how much time is spent into the research behind there would have been quite a bit in your book i imagine ellie and and evan canina with all the different topics that you cover and um some of the different themes there would have been a fair bit of research in yours as well do you want to go ali i imagine there 's so much for you oh so so much um you know i gosh um yeah i look research is my my thing um sometimes i prefer researching over writing um after i write the code breakers i i remember saying to my editor oh it really broke me the next one 's not going to require as much research but lo and behold guess what next story idea is going to going to require a crazy amount of research i can 't help myself so um yeah so with the code breakers in between me writing other books um you know i i 've i consulted with you know um professors at the university of new south wales about you know the history of signals intelligence um and the ex-head of the australian signals directorate which is our big um i guess um cyber organization um as well um which uh central bureau was kind of like the precursor to that um you know i of course consulted with the people who work for central bureau um historians you know in brisbane like so many the list is very long um but i do i absolutely love it it 's you know research is a passion of mine um but it 's actually really nice to know that all the research that i 've done and all the contacts that i 've made um for this particular book um we 're now making a documentary so oh that research is now actually really helping um us develop the documentary um because we 've had to i 've had to deal uh dive into a lot of you know like the national archives we can actually now sort of you know put it together in a documentary so people can um you know can watch it and then um yeah then read the book and forgo oh yeah okay i remember that that 's super exciting is that going to be um out on television or um through one of the streaming or you 're not sure yet yeah well we 're we 've been in talks with um everyone on broadcaster um so uh we hope to have it ready to go uh early to mid next year uh and then i guess i 'll just depend entirely on you know how it fits in with their schedule but um i will definitely be shouting it from the rooftop one once i can yeah but and my jokes there and coverage are just amazingly very experienced doing documentaries so it 's also been a big learning curve for me as well which is great yeah fantastic how do you go about researching for your books well i i 'm just feel you know if uh in awe of ali and other writers very overwhelming to have so much you know fabulous stuff to work with and just know what to pick and what not to pick and what 's too much what 's not enough um i find that enough and that 's with the contemporary novel um so yeah as i said earlier i for this book in particular i spent a lot of time looking through wellness magazines and would read different articles to kind of get in the right headspace and vibe of the of the place that i wanted to create in the healing hands environment itself um but yeah it 's funny you think i don 't you don 't necessarily need to research much but then kind of nearly every storyline or every scene requires something that you don 't know about and then you 've got to be finding out more um for a lot a fair few of the subjects so i spent a lot of time in different forums where i would read lots and lots of people 's personal experiences and what they would say in conversations they were having with one stages of grief and experiences and what happened when to different people to kind of try and get what i wanted to happen within my story to work with i also had a really great beta reader that had been through one of the experiences and um gave great feedback on a draft and then we you know would help with different kinds of wordings and tone um and just suggestions to see whether i would wanted that to take them on board and a lot of i guess just reading different books or googling it sounds terrible but just i don 't know about that so whack it into google and see what else i can find and then there 's one article that links to something else and um yeah and then just talking to people i mean with the alzheimer 's storyline i did talk to my mum a lot about um things that i didn 't remember as a child that i suddenly learned a lot more about and then that would often lead to other people who had been um through different experiences but yeah talking to people and seeing how they 've reacted or how friends and family have reacted in that kind of situation and just taking that on on board and seeing how that relates to the character because yeah i think that 's you know the importance what would be at their heart and true self but yeah it 's definitely not on the same level as ali 's research no well when you 're you 're facing a novel on true historical things though imagine what you 're wrong to get it right because somebody reading it will notice if you don 't yeah that is my biggest fear i 've got a really fabulous editor and um yeah we 're always crosstalking triple checking everything so um yeah which means it 's really hard to let go once it 's done because it 's just like oh no well let me just check and she 's like ally we 've we 've checked it 50 times just that 's it so just a quick reminder for people joining us tonight if you 've got questions for ali and kanina in the chat and we 'll be happy to ask them for you so i 'm moving along a little bit to what your writing process is like and i guess we 'll mention the topic at the moment um covert and it 's affected everybody 's lives we know that but has it affected your writing process and how was the writing experience for these novels different compared to your previous works or was it the same i 'll i 'll go first um so my writing experience so i 've got two manuscripts that are on my computer that haven 't seen the latter day so to speak that i wrote before uh the two that i 've got published so i 've been writing for try and i guess trying to get published for over ten years and in that time i started writing when my son was about seven months old and he 's now 11. so my sleep my sleep my writing has kind of adapted it i first wrote when he was sleeping like having these day naps and so then that kind of 's kind of looked a little bit different for me because i added another two children and so i would try and work when i could but many many times that was pretty impossible to work with three little kids and then um all we have is now was actually i try to think last year at what stage it was at when covert hit i can 't remember but the bulk of the actual manuscript itself would have been written um and the edits would have been done which was horrible homeschooling last year was horrible um this year it 's been horrible i don 't know how anyone enjoys it um this is my year where my youngest went to kindergarten so this was supposed to be like a run free like smith um and i think i think i 've probably done this less writing this to you than i have in many years um yeah i think it 's had a massive impact on me just that my kids are between the ages of 5 and 11 and it 's still even though they 're not home school that 's needing a lot more attention and just that them being in the house like they might they 'll definitely leave me alone more than they did when they were under five but they interrupt all the time and there 's so much chatter and you know sometimes they can 't even have a conversation without me having to referee something so yeah i 'm hoping that life goes back to normal i 've had two glorious days yesterday and today with them being at school my husband 's a teacher so he was back at school and it was raining and it was just delightful like it was just perfect conditions for being a writer at home and i have been working in the school myself and this i haven 't_''_2453.599 this week so i 've you know really relished it yeah and i 'm sure a lot of people can relate to your experiences with homeschooling and and the interruptions and you know just the challenges that it presents to people yeah definitely yeah ally how about you yeah a bit bit of a mixture so the obvious um but um i was right in the midst of probably my really big structural edits um sort of when the whole uh news of congress started happening victoria went into their first lockdown um so i i found it really hard really hard to concentrate um yeah and adapt with you know the online schooling for the kids um and so yeah it was actually it was really really tough i wasn 't feeling creative i was you know struggling quite a bit you know dealing with the whole world news thing as most people were uh and then i got the book in uh and things just kind of started to smooth out i 've got to say this year 's been a lot easier in that regard um my two kids are now in high school though so a lot easier when you go to year seven and year nine um younger kids so it has been a lot a lot smoother um i have actually been probably more productive in the last 18 months than i ever have um i probably put that different sports every single day um often you know i 'd be riding in the in the car while the kids are at swim lessons those sorts of things um so silver lining i 've actually had a bit more time to then pursue other projects as well um you know the glory of technology you know being so lucky to you know be able to do these kinds of events i was really nervous about launching a book you know in the middle of a pandemic because you know you normally get to go and do library events and book signings and all those sorts of things so that has been a really different experience um and yeah i mean it 's been really enjoyable too you know i mean i do love the face-to-face events but the fact that we can do these sorts of things is also really fantastic as well and i think it 's kind of i don 't i i my thoughts are i think in the future book launches will probably be a mixture of both in person and online because i think anywhere and and join in the library event which is really cool yeah and i think i agree with you there that we will move to a mixture of both and um one of the only advantages of you know probably one of the few advantages of covert has been [Music] something that was too hard for too long you know now we can and that means that we can talk to each other even though we 're in vastly different places and and it gives smaller libraries in rural areas like ours an opportunity to connect with a lot more authors which is just fabulous for us oh great for us too yeah yeah for sure so um for both of you um what do you think are the most challenging and rewarding aspects of writing for you kanina do you want to start us off with that one well one of the most challenging that i 've found is um is writing with kids but also writing when you have to write so and i guess i 've done that for many many years but sometimes the um but you 've got an hour you 've either got to sit down and write or you just lose that opportunity so um i 've had to push through plenty of those over the last decade but i must say this morning i was just getting out of the shower and an idea that i 'd been i couldn 't quite grab it before then and i wasn 't planning on doing that creative writing i had other few other jobs that i was going to do but it just came to me and i was like oh my goodness i can just write it down not just try and file it for you know nap time or for when someone 's watching a movie or you know late at night when everyone 's gone to bed so it was just such a you know great moment to be able to write when i could but yeah i think that 's been one of the challenging things when a story is not working and you 've got to just keep working at it it 's another you know challenging part and did you say rewarding as well i 'm rewarding surely the reward is just saying that the end product but you know yeah i think that 's out of it well there 's so many rewarding aspects i think you know when you get to type the end or uh when you get to see the cover um but definitely by far is hearing from readers and you know having them write to you and you know say that especially with all we have in that all we have is now i 've had such lovely feedback from readers who have been through different experiences that they 've seen within the book and just wanted to share their own and you know tell me how much they 've valued what i 'd written and that you know it 's just such an honor if people are taking their personal time and choosing to read your book and be swept away in your imagined world with your characters it 's yeah that 's definitely the most rewarding yeah for you too ellie oh yeah absolutely it 's um it is um it 's funny like sometimes you know a reader will send an email be like oh i know you 're really busy it 's like we always have time to hear from readers um and and and i do the same now because you know if i really connect with a book then i will take time to then you know go right to author and it 's amazing how many times either i 've received an email or i 've sent an email to someone to an author and and you just and it 's just arrived at just that right moment you know authors generally we 're quite neurotic and and we have our ups and downs and and often we all we doubt ourselves and our books and all you know we 're like i would write another one those sorts of things but sometimes you get an email and it just hits you right at the right time and it just gives you that confidence like okay there 's somebody out there who loved my last story i 'll keep going um so yeah those don 't be afraid to reach out to authors and tell them that you love their stories um talented advice yeah look authors love it we spend a lot of time behind the computer so hearing from the outside world is very nice and it can really make your day you can just be lump and then that picture right up absolutely yeah exactly yeah so that 's that 's really that 's really nice um challenging for me is writing the first draft um i i i find them really hard i it 's it 's funny i i think with authors you kind of sit in one camp or the other i love edits i love going back and revising and polishing and adding layers and that kind of stuff i really really love and i thrive on but for me writing the first draft is just quite quite the challenge it is like pulling teeth for me um and i think also i don 't i don 't know whether it 's because i have so much weight like i do a lot of research before i 's other areas i need to go off and research so my first drafts are full of lots of question marks or notes go and research this or you know check this website out and you know so there 's a lot of they 're really scrappy no one ever sees my face they 're terrible um yeah yeah and i find dialogue really easy to write so um there 'll be a lot of dialogue and then there might be you know you know just describe back street on a sunday night or whatever you know like first off i 'll go back and build in later because description takes a lot longer for me to write um and i don 't want to break the flow of the story um yeah so that 's always a challenge i always and and the other thing is um i my writing friends do know me very well because i 'll start complaining about a story that i 'm writing and they 'll go okay so you 're twenty thousand words in and sure enough i 'm twenty thousand thousand words and ninety thousand they 're my oh this story is terrible i hate this why am i writing this i love that that 's consistent each time and the people know you well enough to know that yeah that 's wonderful and um how does that differ from writing a novel for you is that is it more of a team writer yeah yeah absolutely i haven 't done that for quite a long time now that i 've been living regionally and with children but yes it was definitely a collaborative effort and it was lots of fun you 'd sit around to a story table everyone 's tossing different ideas around it 's um one idea sparks another idea which is such a great way to produce story because everyone 's bringing their own personal experiences to the table and you know if i say you know shell to one person each of you would be thinking a different thing about a shell so then if you 're tossing those ideas about um it just creates more opportunity for what to plot for your characters so and in that when you 're writing by yourself there 's only yourself to kind of come up with all those different ideas um but in tv then you 've got a you know compromise you 've got a there 's someone that 's the boss the script story producer is the boss of what actually happens so there 's a obviously a lot of compromising at different points um but when you 're the author you get to decide everything you get to choose so that 's you know it 's lovely having the power of doing um you know your own your own version of the story also in tv there 's lots of production requirements i worked on um home and away so there was different requirements about actors being allowed on only certain number of episodes per week and those different set you could only have so many scenes in each set and so many scenes on each location and all those kinds of things would be taken into account so yeah so that was something that you would be mindful of when you 're plotting the story you you really want it to be an outsole an outdoor scene but you just don 't have room for it so it has to be inside or then sometimes it 's you know moved inside because it 's been pouring with rain for three days and they can 't shoot it outside um i also with tv there was you were riding with commercial breaks and because when i learned there was commercial breaks it 's not just all streaming like it is these days and cliffhangers and things like that which is really influence the way i write myself i don 't write chronologically i write these scenes that come to mind and then you know flip and flop from back and forth all over the place which i 'm sure is a really silly way to write um your daughter writes this thing no my brother my brother 's an author as well and he 's he 's the same yeah he just he 's got like lines and little scenes and paragraphs and you know when you 're saying that about the first draft i was they write about 20 drafts within that first draft and i 'm sure i do that i write and i go back and i change and i write and i go back and then oh i don 't know i really every time i 'm like no i 'm gonna write it in order and then all of a sudden i have this you know idea for what that massive scene needs to be and then i go oh i better write it so i don 't forget it and and then i 've got to fill in all the things that happen before we get to that this point so but that 's how tv does it they mark up those big how i was taught to mark out those big points and um yeah feeling later yeah one of our guests has said that tim winton writes that way so you 're in the company very flattered um ali you 've hosted writing workshops and retreats for aspiring authors um perhaps both of you can touch on what what 's your best advice for those wanting to make write the story that you would want to read um because you know all writers are readers um and you 're going to spend a long time with um with your characters and your storyline so you have to be really connected with them there 'll be days where they 'll just drive you crazy if you don 't want to be in their company but generally yeah write the kind of story that you you would love to pick up of the bookshelf and um and read read lots of books because that is really the best training you know you know read a story and and then you know try and figure out what worked for you and or what didn 't work because you can learn a lot about stories that don 't appeal to you as well um so that 's that 's a really important thing to do as well um but yeah read across the board read widely um go to author events ask questions that 's always really good sorry i 'll let you do something yeah i know you 're taking them definitely write what you want to read and i think that 's a great point about learning from what you don 't necessarily necessarily like in books and i think that um i 've been in a book club for over five years now and i find that that 's been a really constructive way to kind of talk about books but also take on other points of view because um generally it 's odd if everyone agrees on everything within the book and kind of discussing different things i think that 's kind of always in the back of my mind when writing um different people 's reactions to certain things in the story to get published i think my biggest advice is to be really stubborn i know that i was like i 'm not giving on this um yeah i went to writers events writers festivals would do all like courses online and at the new south wales writers center and the australian writers which were both near me at the time when i was first starting out um yeah network take chances put yourself out there with new south wales there 's writers victoria here yeah um yeah go when you can face-to-face do networking events face-to-face if not you know do it online um and um [Music] you also get newsletters and those sorts of things and often in those newsletters you 'll see you know deals being made and which publishing house acquired what particular kind of book and and those sorts of things because then it 'll give you a really good idea as to you know what 's happening in the um in the publishing world so yeah because it can be opportunities yes yeah and contests and ali and i both members of the romance daughters of australia which i think is possibly where we first met ellie yeah and that 's just such a welcoming uh community of people that just that 's where i did my pitching for the one and where i got my first deal too so there 's yeah there 's lots of opportunities just have to be open and willing to try everything i think like you said stubborn no it 's just yeah yeah three manuscripts as well so 10 i think something used to don 't put any of any photos off but i think 10 years is probably you know yeah it 's a hard slog yeah it just takes time yeah yeah and commitment yeah yeah and i 've heard a couple of authors now refer to like the writers associations and and uh the romance writers um australia and that sort of thing so i think you know that 's great advice for people who are looking for opportunities out there yeah yeah yeah and writers are a really generous bunch um we we like to pay it forward um you know i 've had authors help me along the way and um and now i you know try and help other authors sort of coming up through the ranks um you know we all started at the same place um and yeah writers i think really love to encourage each other and help each other out so it 's a great it 's great industry yeah yeah yeah definitely so um i 'm aware we 're just starting to right we 'll keep going because everyone i 'm sure is happy to keep listening so um we will um move on to the next question which is what would you like your one thing for your audience to take away from the experience of reading your books yeah i can see you looking at me yeah you know each other well mine 's probably a sense of hope yeah simply is a sense of hope i feel that yeah you know if they 've gone on the emotional journey with my characters i feel at the end that they you know feel that they are rewarded with you know a hopeful future oh definitely yeah i i 've been wrecking my brains oh my gosh there 's oh there 's all so many things different one of them guess i guess because my book said there 's so many facts built into my books i i would like yeah someone who 's finished one of my books to close close the book and say wow i didn 't know that that whatever it is that they 've learned um know something related to a culture that you know my characters are involved in or whatever yeah they 've learned something new yeah yeah yeah so um what 's next on the horizon i know kanena you said you 've got a couple of manuscripts still sitting there waiting um have you are you working on your next novel both of you those two that i mentioned earlier are ones that i wrote prior so those ones i don 't think will be looked at again i think they 're kind of like the practice you know i 'm trying to find oh yeah but i yeah i have written another a book three what i hope to be book three and it 's currently with my publisher so i 'm just waiting to hear trying to channel patience and yes yes please do um i 've got two novels on the go um one 's my passion project and one 's that my publisher is expecting to see um and i will also yeah got the documentary and um i 've been working with the producer um trying and oh wow yeah she 's based in l.a so every time i wake up in the morning i 'm like emails so we we 're making progress so yeah so lots of balls in the air at the moment but um i 'm happy for it to be like that i i like to be busy and like to know there 's possibilities of lots of different things out there yeah for sure yeah so i guess we 'll hand it over to the audience and and see if there 's anything that they would like to ask i 'll just i 'll read a couple of comments only um that have come in the chat so far um kathy says ellie my favorite genre is world war two books thank you so much for writing the australian co-broker story which i was totally unaware until i read your book so thank you so she learned something and to kanina your characters are so relatable and i agree with that wholeheartedly um all of them in one way or another they 're characters that stayed a long time after i said andrea said that tim winton writes the same way that you do anena so i think you 're in good company there anybody else got any other questions that um they 'd like to ask either kanina or ellie and i 'll just wait to see if anybody starts typing otherwise it 's always that waiting that awkward waiting game to see something in the chat [Laughter] but i guess while we 're waiting so just a reminder of the books again hold it back tanya the code breakers is ellie 's book you could find it online at all good book stores i 'm sure locally here at our local newsagents or portland books and gift they would be happy to look into ordering you a copy we of course have it at the library as well ellie i really enjoyed this story and like so many others i learnt a lot that i didn 't know i i knew about bletchley park i had no idea that it had happened here um and like you say so many important themes in there about women working during the to go back to their normal life holding many secrets afterwards thank you and canada 's all we have is now um kanina i don 't want to spoil you not give any spoilers but i did i really um loved that you explored the themes and the issues in this novel and although i didn 't have personal experience i had friends that had similar experiences and i had like you said earlier not necessarily knowing how to to talk about it with them or broach that subject at the time and so i found this really um enlightening and and i love to the characters i felt i could feel a part of their world and imagine the wellness center that they had and and relate to the friendships and and the way things don 't always turn out the way you think they will ah thank you so much tony that 's lovely all right so there 's no more questions there so um i think we 'll just say thank you very much for joining us we 've really enjoyed it i 've enjoyed the chat will um put this recording up online for those who 've missed out and thank you so much no thank you for having me thanks for attending everyone yeah thanks so much thanks for having us it 's been a great night thank you bye you _"

    "text": "all right thank you for joining tonight everybody first of all my name is casey and i would like to welcome you all here tonight on behalf of the glenelg libraries i 'd also like to start by respectfully acknowledging the traditional lands and the waters that make up the ghundijmara country that we are broadcasting from tonight i acknowledge the elders past present and emerging and through them all aboriginal people i 'm very excited tonight to be chatting with the best-selling australian author brooke mccallery about her newest book care the radical art of taking time author of international best-selling and one of my personal favorites slo brooke is passionate about slow living and is also also has a podcast the slow home podcast which i recommend you guys checking out so six years ago brooke was completely overwhelmed she had two young children a husband that worked long hours a business and a home filled to the brim with all of the trappings of a successful life and a severe case of postnatal depression which i 'm sure some of us can relate to and everything changed and her husband are self-employed and enjoy life-centered on the important things which turn out not to be things at all so welcome brooke i 'm so excited to have you oh casey thank you thank you very much for introduction too i 'm really i 'm really stoked to be talking to you yeah same um in person or not it 's great to have you soon one day very soon so we 're here to chat about your new book which i enjoyed reading myself very excited to read that so can you tell us about the book just in a couple of sentences yeah so oh that 's a that 's tricky a couple of things i know hard question first off yeah that 's okay we start we dig in um [Music] it 's essentially an a really deep dive into what care is you know um going beyond the stereotypical ideas of care and self-care and looking at all the different ways that we can show up in our lives in acts of care and it 's arranged around like nine core kind of ideas that was probably two sentences no that 's okay that 's great so going off that what 's the difference between big care and self-care and small care yeah so as a bit of context um last year like a lot of people i think um i found myself completely cared out at about april may of 2020 and i mean looking back there 's no surprise that we felt like that and probably still feel like that in some instances because we had the drought and then we had the bushfires and then we had the floods and then covert hit and then 2020 took us all on that very wild ride and 2021 's you know put on its heels um and i found myself as someone who i pride myself on you know caring i care about the world i care about the people who live in the world i care about my community and you know the planet and um that 's something that i 've always identified myself as and then one day i woke up and i couldn 't i couldn 't care like was when i started to think about well what does caring mean you know and i realized that there 's a spectrum of care in that on one end you 've got what i call big care and that 's you know covered that 's climate crisis that 's uh you know social inequality and racial injustice is like the big systemic collective global things that are really important really big and really overwhelming if that 's all we focus our time and energy on and then i sort of i thought well what if i dive into the other end of the spectrum and go into self-care well that helped me to you know regain some of my ability to to feel and engage and um you know show up again in ways that i want to and it did to a certain point but i also then found on that end of the spectrum that self-care has a like it 's kind of problematic in a lot of ways in that the way it 's marketed to us now means we need to spend money and it helps if you 're wealthy and you know you 've got access and time and energy so i thought you know is are they the two types of care that we have access to um and i didn 't_''_300.96 i didn 't want to believe that it was so i looked at what remained in the middle of this spectrum and that 's where i landed on the idea of small care which really are those those small and often tiny active leave us feeling uplifted connected cared for in any number of ways and they can be self-focused but they can also be other focused um and what 's different i think about small care is that very rarely do those acts of care exist in a vacuum like everything every kindness every act of connection every moment of noticing has ripples and those ripples reach out as well you know into our families communities workplaces yeah i liked that you touched on that um commercialization about care and the fact that you know it 's not all about paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to a a accessible to people and you know since covert hit us it 's very rarely accessible to even go and get a facial or a massage um yeah so i loved that you touched on just the little things that people can do for themselves um and there 's no cost to a lot of it like you said it 's not things and belongings it 's um yeah yeah so one of the threads that was really important to me to weave all the way through the book was like how can i break this idea of care down into ways that are accessible to the vast majority of us you know regardless of our finances or our time or our physical abilities or capacity or you know um space and access to facilities all that sort of stuff it just i think that came almost from a place of frustration that there 's so many benefits to be experienced when we practice this idea of care and so many of us were being left out of the conversation because of all of those you know all of those qualifiers 're here to talk about care but how does care um relate to your previous book slow i 've read them both um and i know the answer to that but i just yeah let 's share i think um in one in one way it 's a continuation of exploring time you know and how we spend it and why that um is important like in in slo i talked a lot about living life according to the things that are important to you so firstly figuring out what those things are and as you said they 're very often not things at all um but people and you know legacy and and what we stand for um and and slo really looked at how to create that space and time to do that and care is kind of a continuation of that in that how do we then show up in our lives so that we 're in you know alignment with our values and our priorities um and we can do that through all those different kind of acts of care that i explore in the book 't considered super closely until you mentioned it a second ago is that um slow obviously was about that idea that what is most important in life is not material it 's not the stuff we own it 's not the status symbols that we collect um it 's about who we spend time with and how we spend that time and care really is a um a digging deeper into that idea of you know extracting ourselves from the capitalist side of absolutely yes air in these movements and looking at it through the lens of humanity and um you know connection and i guess community in a very broad broad manner speaking yeah and i think more than ever people need community um more than things you know i think if anything covered has taught us that community and connection is so important um it looks slightly different now obviously but all the things that we 've got gathered don 't actually bring us joy in a sense some things do obviously but you know they don 't um keep the loneliness at bay either you know we and be perfectly comfortable but there 's i don 't think there 's stuff that you can buy that will um lead you to that sense of belonging um you know that comes with community and um you know taking up space in the world and and being seen to do that as well there 's something so powerful and i think we all need it um and i 'm a super introverted person and covert has been really interesting for me because it has highlighted that as much as i like my own company i absolutely need to have that interaction with people yeah yeah yeah i think yeah i think so too so um what was it like riding through covert and lockdown and what what did you find filled your cup while doing that um how did you balance that i didn 't know that i balanced it very well i 'm perfectly honest um i it was tough you know and i had so many conversations with fellow writers and creators um throughout that time and we all found it really really difficult to focus you um there 's so much information pouring into our heads daily that um at some point during the day you max out on decision making and you know the amount of energy you can give things and writing obviously takes a lot of both of those so i stopped writing for a couple of months and in the end i think it was the best thing that i could have done a because it gave me permission to just let this really weird time in the world be a really weird time in the world and not try and carry on as though everything 's fine and nothing 's free i think we 've tried to do that for a while didn 't we everyone just kind of went oh this will this will go away yeah yeah yeah um you know so i think that was really helpful and that is funnily enough kind of what i reflected on when i was writing some of the later chapters in the book like what happens when we give ourselves permission to not just push through um you know and that healing chapters i loved the rest thank you that that chapter and that resonated with me um who sits for 15 minutes and does nothing like that is so it 's strange and hard yep um like i i meditate myself personally and stuff like that but to just actually be and sit with your own thoughts it 's quite daunting for a lot of people i think yeah um i think that that chapter was really those last two chapters yeah i 've read them twice that 's really good that 's cool they were really cool because it 's not something that people talk about it 's not something that society let 's be okay who acknowledge that we need to rest and resting is not it 's not consuming it 's not like binging netflix and listening to podcasts and reading they 're all fine and great um and but it 's also rest is also not producing as much as we like to think we 're being kind of chill when we 're pottering and you know doing little bits and pieces at a leisurely pace where we just sit and we think our thoughts and that 's it like yeah just be um there was a i referenced it in the book actually there was a study done a few years ago where a group of men and women were invited to sit in a room by themselves um for 15 minutes and they had no stimulus at all in that room they just had to sit there and think their thoughts and they had a choice they could sit there for the 15 minutes and think their thoughts or they could self-administer electric shocks yes two-thirds of the men self-administered electric shocks rather than sit there with their own thoughts um and it was about a quarter of the women so you know we 're really uncomfortable with the idea of being alone without our thoughts yeah that 's something i 'm going to start adding to my life i think i 'd really like to give it a go and just practice you know it 's like a muscle it 's that 's what i discovered because i i tried myself i 'm do anything for 15 minutes and i could have sworn an hour had passed and it was like two minutes you know just not ripped necessarily so you practice and then i think once you know what it feels like to just sit in your thoughts and settle into that space in between you can start you know going for aimless walks or sitting in the garden or you know throwing the ball to your dogs or whatever it might be and still be in that space but you need to practice you need to build up um the strengths yeah exactly yeah exactly so um a lot of people are at home obviously with their children and families is there anything um you know how can we bring care or teach our children about care um i feel like um you know there 's so much tech and stuff at the moment especially with homeschooling and stuff and and connecting with friends is always obviously now not in person it 's all online so how do we teach them and bring that into their little lives yeah and i to strike that balance but so important because as you said so much of their time is spent digitally and it 's by necessity you know and so we do it but um one of the things that i find probably the most powerful and it takes such a short amount of time for kids to switch into this mode is to go outside um you know into any outdoor space that you have access to whether that 's a balcony a front step a backyard a park the footpath out the front of your apartment building you know um and encourage them to just sit and pay attention to something tiny whether it 's an ant crawling along the ground or a bird 's nest or you know seedlings starting to pop out of the dirt digging in the dirt finding worms um and do it with them and kind of find that sense of wonder in those tiny little details um and you 'll find that your kids are much better at it than you are because they just have that ability you know that everything is a with them even if it 's for five minutes a day or if your kids get a brain break do one of the brain breaks outside you know looking at something anything cloud watching um listening to the different bird songs the thing that happens is it 's kind of like a multi-pronged benefit to it because a gets everyone outdoors and into you know into wild spaces um and the footpath out the front of the of your house is a wild space um you know and as we start to sense the the rhythms and the movement and the other beings and creatures and plants that live there we begin to gradually see ourselves as part of that kind of space um that that allows us to you know feel a sense of stewardship and belonging to our own little corner of the world um but it also invites all into our days and ore is super powerful as an emotion as an experience uh and the benefits of ore are basically a laundry list of all the things that we need more of in life at the are happier you know they have higher happiness hormone levels so as a result they 're less stressed they are more patient i know i need that my kids are homeschooling they 're more generous they 're more likely to feel cooperative and collaborative and the thing i think that most adults eyes light up at when i talk about is that people who experience ore frequently feel like they have more time and even though we 've got the same amount that we had before and i think that that is quite literally a list of things that we all need at the moment so yeah with your kids back and simplifies it which again that 's that passion for slow living it 's going back to that exactly i just i love it i love like looking at the tiniest of mundane details and finding something joyful or delightful or unexpected there yeah yeah so reconnecting with nature is one of the key ideas in care and a personal favorite of mine i really enjoyed that as well how did you become to realize that you were disconnected back into the natural world and becoming a part of nature because that 's we are yeah the natural world yeah i think that is so important for me um which is why i always encourage people to get outside as much as possible um but for me i like i grew up as a really outdoorsy kid and i think i thought that i i automatically became an outdoorsy adult and it wasn 't really until i was um older i was married i had kids that i realized like i hardly ever went outside except to hang the clothes on the line or maybe walk the kids around the block in the stroller and it 's strange that that 's how i ended up because i had a stack of um veggie gardening books on my bedside table for years and i read them cover to cover like back to front inside you all the details about crop rotation and the importance of composting and you know getting heirloom seeds and all that kind of i knew it all um but i didn 't have veggie garden instead know i think that was a very clear sign from my gardener that i needed to get outside into nature but it took me a little while like i wasted many hours of my life like planting pretend crops and stuff not being able to eat them exactly and like i would rotate the crops in this game it didn 't matter didn 't do anything it was just it was it was an absurd thing to have done um but when i finally figured out that actually probably what i really need is to get outside um i was then overwhelmed by the process like how do you go from screen you know screen addict to organic vegetable gardener and going back to what you said i decided to adopt that idea of going really small and really slow with the changes and instead just spent one minute a day walking through my garden after i 'd hung the clothes out and looking at the flowers that were blooming or the bees or you know what the ants were doing with their nests or whatever it didn 't matter sense of understanding of the seasons of the movements of you know the other things that lived in the same area that i did um and from there it just started to really grow and i started bush walking and you know my kids got to the age where they could come with me and it just became this sort of expanding relationship um and within a couple of years i realized that usually the answer to whatever question that i have or whatever issue i 'm struggling with can if not be found can certainly be shaken loose when i 'm outside so yeah it 's just to me if i 'm feeling cranky if i 'm restless if i 'm feeling unwell um obviously not if you 're feeling unwell in the ways that we 're worried about at the moment [Music] go outside if you 're feeling well um but generally speaking the answer can be found in time outdoors you know um i go for a bush walk and within five minutes it doesn 't matter how bad a mood i was in to start with cheshire cat because tree medicine and this smells and the light and the feel all just um connects me to something much much much bigger than myself and as a result i think you gain perspective and your problems become right-sized rather than oversized i agree and the tree medicine that was i didn 't know that we spend lots of time outside and we do lots of bushwicking as well so it was nice to know that the feel good was actually a feel good like it 's yeah it is actual medicine it is actual medicine it 's yeah it 's magical isn 't it it really is and that 's part of the reason i included so many of those facts and you know so much research in the book was because often we know that things are good for us but if we don 't know why i think we kind of tend to underestimate their power so i could say yeah i know i feel better if i go for a bush walk but if i can say to myself no but you 'll be system will function more effectively for six weeks afterwards or you know if you go for a barefoot bush walk you will change like the way that your feet move and the ligaments and um bones in your feet will move like to know that kind of stuff i think is really it 's good for the skeptics yes as well yeah i agree um so what makes you think that kindness and particularly self-kindness is the key to unlocking one of humanity 's superpowers good question i was excited to ask okay so i had a really interesting relationship with the idea of kindness in that i i 've always thought that it was important and powerful in like a nice way um but i didn 't necessarily know that you know we often and this is me probably from three or four years ago talking we talk about if we 're faced with hatred or you know anger or rage or you know those sorts of really scary negative um emotions from other people we we face it with kindness and i got it like i thought that it could match you know rage and kindness how do they how do they match each other is that a fair fight um so i always brought my kids up to be kind and i always um tried to walk through my day kindly but i didn 't necessarily think it was a world-changing idea until um covered actually and it it offered this incredible counterpoint to so much of the aggression and the greed that we saw particularly in the early days you know people fighting over bags of rice and flour and that kind of stuff and it was just fear people were just afraid um but almost as soon as those stories started dominating news headlines there was this whole other movement of you know good news and kindness and random acts of kindness and i felt like they created this incredibly beautiful bond between strangers so you know i started reading about kindness and i was sort of beginning to to write the book at this point started reading about kindness and discovered that it is so incredibly powerful um as an act that we can of us don 't is because we don 't necessarily have a lot of space for kindness for ourselves and that i think ended up being why i had such resistance to the idea of kindness because in order to offer it freely into the world i needed to offer it to myself and that is not something that i was ever good at and it 's not really something that we 're um encouraged to do or sort of shown really a society thing isn 't it like lots of you know if you 're super kind to yourself you 're almost looked at as selfish exactly exactly consensus yeah so i think you know i took it two ways initially the reason i wanted to practice this idea of self-kindness was because i was desperate to raise kids who liked themselves you know if we 're able to raise children who like themselves most days the world will be very different by the time they 're adults because so much of what we 're sold going back to stuff and you know so much of what we 're points are things that we 've been taught are like wrong about us we 're broken we 're not good enough we 're not you know whatever enough so if i was able to raise kids who were a lot more resilient against that kind of messaging imagine like can you imagine how different their lives would be and hopefully as a result you know um their friends lives and their their schoolmates and all that kind of stuff their communities yeah exactly so and if you 're able to kind of see that through a 10 000 foot view you can really see how teaching people to like themselves or to be kind to themselves um can be a genuinely world-changing idea because all of a sudden those pain points aren 't so painful anymore because we just we like ourselves and then we don 't give in to all of those you know buy this and you 'll be happy or exactly spend money on this and you 'll be happy and because they 're basically just telling us that there 's something wrong with us you know realized that i had to do that work for myself and on myself um before i was able to gift it to other people and it 's hard like it 's really tough it 's not something that i think we 're particularly well equipped to do um but even just turning up the volume a little bit a little bit on that voice that says that was great well done or you know yeah you got out of bed today and you didn 't want to or you know whatever in yourself that compliment that you give other people exactly exactly um and learning how to you know deal with the awkwardness and the guilt factor of spending a bit of time being kind to we just need to allow ourselves to to do it um and to learn to be comfortable with it and um to encourage it in other people too yeah definitely so the chapter on play i found that really interesting um especially because i have two younger children at the moment um and you seemed nervous writing it yeah you said you were nervous it did you find anything that helped shift that nervousness or you know do you find now that um i don 't know play doesn 't always come naturally to adults but do you find that there was a shift after after that um i do actually which is wonderful because i had a very complex relationship with the idea of play i had just convinced myself from when my kids were really little that i i wasn 't playful i wasn 't_''_1758.48 the fun parent my husband 's a fun parent you know he 's the jumper sampling parent he 's the wrestling bad parent um he 's the parent who will make a joke when i would probably get cranky you know he 's just i don 't have and i do think that probably broadly speaking it 's women who struggle with this um this kind of you have a certain role to uphold i feel exactly yeah and play is not something that is put up as a priority um and that 's what i found i think this is why i was so nervous to my kids playful you know i did um i was happy to do it because i knew that it was benefiting them it was benefiting a relationship it was important um so i did it most of the time uh you know but i started to research what play actually is and the people who study research who study play um incredibly intelligent people lots of them they can 't actually agree on what play is uh because it looks different to everybody um other than plays needless and this was the really big realization for me when i wrote this chapter was that when i was playing with my kids and finding it kind of like a chore sorry yeah uh that 's because it wasn 't play it wasn 't needless i was doing it for a reason uh and that 's that really switched something in me so you know then the question became well what does play look like for me um and i had this conversation with my brother-in-law one sunday morning we 'd gone to a water park with our kids uh and he and you know how that kind of weighed heavily on us and we felt guilty about it and i didn 't realize until later that we had this conversation while we were to go on a water slide and we were lining up to go on a water slide without our kids like our kids weren 't with us we were just doing it for fun so even that was important to go well this is play you know anything that gets me out of the effects of gravity that 's play and that 's why i love roller coasters and you know riding a mountain bike and skiing and that kind of stuff um so really broadening the picture broadening the um the definition of play has been so helpful to me um in accessing that lighter side and i have found that unexpectedly i 'm more likely to laugh now and make a joke rather than get cranky um and that 's probably partly because my kids are a bit older and i feel like i 've got a bit more capacity um in that sense but it i want to dance in the kitchen when i 'm cooking breakfast that 's because i 'm trying to be playful um when i want to dig in the in the veggie garden and like squeeze the mud through my fingers like that 's play and it 's incredibly um joyful yeah yeah it is all right so lastly um what is one of the go-to acts of small care that you personally enjoy um and practice um i think practicing doing nothing is actually one of the ones that is super important tough to as we 've already discussed but learning to just be in even that doesn 't need to be 15 minutes is brilliant and if you want to set a timer and put yourself away somewhere quiet for 15 minutes then go for it but even 30 seconds you know of staring out the window in between writing emails or scheduling five minutes at the back of every zoom call that you do for work and giving yourself that time to stare out the window or to doodle in the corner of your notepad to daydream memory it doesn 't it doesn 't matter what you do with it but really scheduling that time and creating an offer that allows you to simply be and really learn to resist the temptation of picking up your phone or checking the news headlines or you know scrolling through facebook or whatever it might be because those that tech particularly will steal every single free moment of your day if you let it um even if we tell ourselves it 'll only be for a minute it 's usually for longer than a minute it 's never a minute never stop for a minute i get on my phone to check my bank balance and then suddenly i 'm on instagram and i 've checked all three news websites and my emails and and and you know yeah so i think that learning how to create boundaries around our tech use is is probably one of the um more boring acts of care that we could all benefit from um one of the ones that i think is just a delight is to find a sit spot you know a view of something green whether it 's a pot plant or you know next door neighbor 's yard or your own backyard and just sit for a few minutes a day maybe while you 're drinking a cup of tea or coffee maybe if you journal you write a one-line journal a day or something but just develop that sense of settling into a physical place and observing the way it changes over the days and weeks and months and um you know i love i get a genuine thrill when i hear the black cockatoos now that fly over my house some months of the year because it feels like you know you can see the the shifting seasons and that feels like a sense of yeah belonging yeah and you can kind of own that spot exactly you know your body will just start to recognize that spot and relax as soon as you find that spot it becomes kind of part of your ritual or your routine yeah yeah i 'm a huge fan of the idea of ritualizing like normal things because that elevates them 't have to go and do anything um extravagant you can just go and grab your cup of tea and sit on the back step um that 's a ritual and it 's like a settling into a moment the other thing that i view as a ritual every day and it 's such a strange little thing is opening the curtains in my in our living room um and like gritting the day regardless of the weather if there 's just something really grounding in doing that um yeah i like that um now are you happy to answer any questions if anyone 's got any questions um they can pop them into the chat so maya is wondering sure she would love to hear how you got your book contract okay good question um so i 've read is my third book um and i wrote a book called destination simple in 2015 and i self-published it um on amazon and you know thank you um it did fine and it was like it 's a nice book it 's a lovely book that kind of really like ritual and rhythms um and then i started my podcast at about the same time and i think to be perfectly honest it was the podcast that really got the attention of who became a published show a woman alan um she got in touch with me asked if i 'd ever considered writing a book and this is sort of three years into our podcast so asked if i 'd ever considered writing a book about slow living and i had like i 'd written a proposal based on a template i found online at some point about six months previous and i sent that to her and looking back it was very overblown and would be about you know 200 thousand words long but i put that off to her and i didn 't hear anything for months probably three months maybe longer and um i had written it off as something that wasn 't going to happen and then i got an email from her asking if they could um if i would be interested in writing the book that i had pitched but then they also of my ebook and publish that as a print book so it was kind of a bit of a convoluted process but if i was to give like a headline it would be that i had been writing online as a blogger and podcasting about this topic for many years and i guess i had a body of work that i could um show you know that that showed that i understood the topic and and had um a point of view on it too which i think mattered rather than just um rather than just kind of following the trends of slow living yeah great fabulous thanks maya said does anyone else have any questions tracy um so is care available in an audio format i know tracy has listened to slo twice she has so she 's yeah keenly waiting for the keenly waiting for care um the short answer is yes it will be and it should have already been out except um that life had other plans so i had recorded the first day of the audiobook back in april first day of five and then thank you he thankfully has recovered but he spent um 14 weeks in icu so it was pretty intense and i ended up living most of the time with my mum supporting her so it got put on the back burner understandably and i have just started this week recording the audio book in my wardrobe so the studio is closed great i think the um the roosters and the cockatoos might add to it i think so i mean i don 't think they 'll do anything bad to the recording does anyone else have any questions um let me just have a little look no one else is writing it 's always that moment like at a live event exactly just wait a minute we 've got someone caroline is just riding so we 'll just wait a second so caroline 's wondering what do you like to read good question um i read a huge amount of fiction and up until um last year the beginning of last year i read a lot of dystopian fiction which i can 't do at the moment um and haven _''_2446.4 so so as a result i read a lot of middle grade fiction um and young adult fiction and i just find it a delight so yeah yeah i mean the hunger games is like my go-to read because i just think the world building in it is phenomenal but um i really i think i 've shifted a lot to fantasy and magical realism and that kind of that kind of book a because my daughter likes reading that sort of genre and i like reading what she reads um but b because i think there 's just so many well-written um kids and young adult books now that have a sense of lightness that you know equivalent adult books don 't always have so yeah i read a lot of a lot of young adult and middle grade fiction um what else have i read recently though that i 've really enjoyed um i 'm a big stephen king fan um which i have not really read any of his books in the last year and a half i 'm just trying to protect my heart a little is the most recent um non-fiction book that i read future studying by jade miles um it 's wonderful it 's so brilliant such a practical book um about the you know the the byline is living like tomorrow matters but it 's so beautiful and so practical and she breaks down life on um you know life for anyone regardless of where you live whatever your um your location in the country is um she breaks things down into like a seasonal approach but much more um you know much more ritualistic seasons rather than order autumn you know winter spring summer like the awakening and then i hate and um it 's just it 's brilliant i really highly recommend it for anyone who 's interested in slow living who 's interested in growing food who 's interested in strengthening community through you know um through a multitude of different ways but obviously centered around food yeah it 's awesome interesting um caroline said thank you um sans just said you 've planted the seed we 'll just have to slow down now and read your book now more questions coming through i don 't think um so you can purchase care online from any good bookstore or locally here in portland our news agents has both care and slow available they got that in so you can drop in and see them or give them a ring to pick it up and purchase it and of course we have both copies of brooks books in the library which you can borrow for free and if they are out which they are because they 're popular um you can pop a hold on them as well so thank you so much brooke it was really lovely to speak to you um tracy thank you yeah we loved having you so um take care and thank you everyone for joining us um uh margaret 's at the portland news agency we 've got great job thank you ladies thank you can you see the the comments brooke yeah it 's really lovely well thank you all very much for coming out this is my final book tour event virtual book tour event so it 's such a nice way _"

    "text": "like most coastal locations the bridgewater bay foreshore is vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding historically storm surges and king tides have been severe enough to warrant the construction of an informal rock wall to control coastal erosion and protect the foreshore amenities including the road car parks surf club and the local dune system therefore a properly engineered dynamic rock wall is necessary before investing substantial funds into renewed foreshore amenities the rock wall is designed for future storms and if properly maintained will be able to protect the foreshore for decades to come the dynamic rock wall will be just over 400 meters long and will follow the alignment of the existing rock wall which was built informally over decades the department of environment land water and planning authorised this alignment following a thorough site assessment leading to consent for the works under the marine and coastal act walls are commonly used in australia to provide a physical barrier to ongoing shoreline erosion a nearby example is the dutton way seawall which was constructed following years of coastal erosion along the foreshore while a rock wall does not processes and impact the natural flow of sand across and along the beach this is sometimes observed in erosion at the end of the structure an erosion of sand in front of the rock wall after storms this is likely to be a temporary issue at bridgewater bay because the beach compartment is full of a large volume of sand and the structure has been specifically designed to minimize these impacts periodic inspection and maintenance of the foreshore will manage any minor beach erosion should it occur along the regional coastline sand generally flows from west to east in portland the flow of alongshore sand around the cape is around 50 000 cubic meters per year enough to fill about 20 olympic swimming pools the coastal erosion at dutton way is associated with the interruption of this alongshore sandflow by the portland harbour breakwaters which prevent this flow of sand from reaching the shoreline at dutton way currently the beach is in a building phase and is not eroding significantly however the volume of sand on the beach naturally fluctuates and the beach can erode when this natural sand availability by nature and presently there are no indications of a reduction in beach volume coastal erosion of the cliffs to the west of the site will continue to provide uninterrupted large volumes of sand into the bay for years to come also at bridgewater bay there are no man-made breakwater structures nearby this is different to dutton way which is located near the portland harbour breakwaters which act to reduce natural sand flow along the coast the sand movements will remain natural at bridgewater bay however it is important to consider that sand volume fluctuates over time as part of the natural beach erosion and rebuilding cycles the shape and volume of sand on the beach changes over time and is shaped by the tides and waves currently there is a lot of sand on the foreshore however future storms could result in local beach erosion generally sand flows from west to east however the natural rate of this sand flow along the coast is not constant typically it moves in large scale sand bars and has large sand slugs depending on the position of these sand bars the dry waves erode the sand from the dry beach dunes and deposit this sand into near shore sandbars this is known as the beach erosion phase in the weeks and months following the storm karma waves then push the sandbar back on shore and replenish the beach this is known as the beach accretion or beach recovery phase these natural cycles of coastal erosion and coastal accretion are essential to a healthy and dynamic beach environment the beach will generally recover in the weeks and months following a storm after extreme storms there are some localized scour effects that slow the beach recovery in front of the wall however this is likely to be a temporary issue at bridgewater bay because the beach compartment is full of sand and there are no major man-made interruptions of the alongshore sand flow within the bay the existing rock wall has not reduced the ability of the beach to recover after storms and the proposed engineered rock wall will have a similar effect the existing rock wall is in poor condition and was constructed reactively after storms and slowly over time the existing structure against powerful storm waves it requires a substantial upgrade to perform effectively and manage coastal erosion it is not physically possible to provide a lot of car parking space along the foreshore car parking on the beach is only authorised for the surf lifesaving club and for emergency vehicles because space along the foreshore is limited a balance must be achieved between car parking space public safety and the quality of public amenities traffic on the surf club hard stand must be safely managed pedestrian access around the car park will be provided to manage safe vehicle and pedestrian interactions shade vegetation and pedestrian access along and across the rock wall are essential ingredients to preserve and improve the local amenities several access ramps stairs and viewing platforms have been included in the design all based on the master plan the main purpose of the rock wall is to control storm erosion along the foreshore rather than letting the beach and dunes retreat into the foreshore car parks and threaten assets the rockwall will provide a last line of defense against coastal erosion while some armor rocks could be displaced however the rockwall is not a coastal levee and is not high enough to manage extreme coastal flooding events the infrastructure behind the rock wall remains vulnerable to coastal flooding during major storm events the renewed structure will significantly reduce the potential for coastal flooding however the land levels behind the wall will not be raised and the rock wall may be over topped by breaking waves during major storms the landside works have been designed to be resilient to the harsh coastal environment _"

community workers who provide inspiration and pride to australia day events this year the australia day council has put together the ambassador via an address of on video today we welcome virtually major brenton nottle commanding officer of the salvation army in melbourne and 2020 victorian australian of the year finalist as commanding officer of the salvation army major brendan nottle has dedicated over two decades of his life to working with the most vulnerable people of in our society leading salvo 's melbourne project 6 6 14 he works with a team of a thousand volunteers to help people who are homeless or suffering from mental health issues addiction or social poverty going out practical support including meals clothing and counselling as well as working with clients to connect them with services that can facilitate their transition back into society but most importantly he forges one-to-one human connections that help people feel less marginalized and alone brendan is a member of the premier 's ice action task force and the victorian housing minister 's rough sleepers roundtable and frequently advocates for issues facing those risk of homelessness in 2013 he was named melbourne melbourne of the year in recognition of his tireless efforts to support disadvantaged people it now gives me great pleasure to introduce you to the 2020 australia day ambassador major brenton nottle to begin i would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we are meeting wherever you may be today and i pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging what 's great about australia day one it 's an opportunity for us to celebrate the fact that we look out for each other especially when our backs are against the wall too it 's an opportunity for us to celebrate our indigenous culture world and that 's something we should be incredibly proud of and something that we should celebrate my grandmother was seven half months pregnant with my mum back in 1928 and she had three little kids and uh her husband died at a pretty young age and he had some pretty serious addictions so he left very little money in the bank for the family and it was the local salvos that turned up with a box of food and i think the salvos were back then incredibly helpful to our family and so it almost got embedded in our dna one of the things for me is there are an increasing number of australians that feel overwhelmingly isolated and i i think that 's one of the drivers for me is what can i do to actually address social poverty and it doesn 't take much and when you you just spend time with people and uh when you actually see them not just uh emotionally doing better but actually physically they 're upright they 're able to look you in the eye and you think wow you know on this person 's life that drives me to to actually do more i think one of the things about australia is we 've actually led the way when it comes to addressing covert and i think we 're a we 're a world leader in that area there 's no question about that but i think where we 're leading the world is also in the area of the way that we 've looked out for each other i think that 's absolutely critical and i think it 's one of the things that we often overlook but we are remarkable in looking out for those that have been given up on we 're remarkable and looking out for those that have fallen through the gaps and that 's something that we 're great at but it 's something that we need to continue to be great at going forward so this australia day i 'd really encourage you to think about someone that feels like they 've just been given up on pick up the phone go and have a coffee with them and remind them that they i said at the beginning everything 's a little bit different this year but i i think that was a really good reflection from brenton brendan okay it is my pleasure now to welcome back to the stage um for all of us that enjoy the music the stumpy gully

Simon Lewis well I guess it 's my time to speak and it 's got a lot to follow and hopefully the rain stays away I 'd like to acknowledge the indigenous owners and past present and emerging leaders I come from there you will a man of the bluring nation in the coulomb member of the Kulin nation and with that it has taught me that where I am I get to be privileged enough learn about the history and you know I 'm a humanitarian I 've been around the world but I still have that Peter Allen song in me you know I still call Australia home and why is that why on Australia Day you know when we have ambassadors we have mayors we have new citizens you know what 's that community spirit what is that essence about being home last night I saw the pride in the community I saw everyone embracing John Stephens on that stage and having a wonderful time you know the community got together and I saw people on date night I saw kids running amuck I saw teenagers enjoying New Deal 's and a lot of wonderful other things that all passion pop but I did see you know this community spirit this this local a gathering of love and it was just such an amazing thing and you know when you gave it to John you know he gave it back and you that support in that community you know no matter how much money you had what religion you were what creed or you embraced the local kind of spirit and you know I didn 't see any one board I didn 't see anyone you know kind of being disappointed but I all I saw was people enjoying themselves and again you know in the community no matter where you travel you know why do you still call Portland home and I think last night represented that you know it was such a wonderful evening and it was such an amazing experience to be a part of so congratulations because you don 't see that in many communities in 2014 I ran eight marathons in five months a ridiculous kind of undertaking I was 90 kilos but essentially after 336 kilometers I got to see every major city of Australia and I 've got to see people achieving goals and you know they weren 't all the fit athletic people there were people running their first marathon so marathon is 42 kilometers and you have to be really committed you have to have purpose and you know it 's not all about the time thank God on the medals they don 't age I 'd actually just know how I achieved it not what time I got because times are thing with runners so having learnt how to run having learnt how to make a commitment having learnt how to find purpose I had to actually do it and having an idea actually doing it and learning from it is what we all can do no matter what you come from or no matter what you fearing of you can go and run a marathon and achieve it or you can walk it because at the end of days to get the same medal so it 's very easily to get that goal and get that achievement I did it for the indigenous marathon project the indigenous marathon project was done by fellow Australian day ambassador Rob D Castella you know obviously Rob has had a running career but what he focused on was you keep your head where your feet are in other words don 't overthink just try and marathons and taking the biggest problems you can achieve with small steps one step after the other get to the finish all do every day we wake up we take steps we achieve little goals and then at the end there 's a bigger picture whether you know you started on the journey to become an Australian citizen well today you 've just achieved and now you 've got your your medal but it 's only the beginning there are many more things that you can do in contribute and maybe one day you end up in the Australia Day Awards or as an Australian day ambassador speaking to many communities but for me my journey is very simple you know I started in school I had no idea what I was doing in school I kind of finished and then I went okay well what I 'm gonna do next so I thought I might become a cop and I did a diploma of justice administration no idea why I did that but I needed a diploma because I wanted to get a job so I thought I was gonna work in the courts didn 't really like it at the end of the day so I went okay I Arts in media and culture and marketing no idea where I kind of really kind of wanted to do it but I just did it because I thought I needed a degree and so I 've got this degrees I 've got diplomas and I 'm not really using him so I just when I would go do a job what can I do and so I started lifesaving and then I started lifeguarding and then I started ocean life-saving and then I started working in search and rescue just as a job I had no idea where it was going to take me or why it was going to be a bigger picture later in my life but what came together was I saw an image of a drowned Syrian boy called Alan Kurdi that was all over the news and I said to myself that kid has two arms and two legs and yet I save people and he is just a human why am I not helping save people in the Syrian refugee crisis so my diploma of justice when I went to Greece I had to words I knew what all the big words were deployment of justice came in handy I had the media I had seen in I had the front cover of the age I had the media coming for me bachelor of arts media and culture I knew how to speak to them I knew how to give it together and give them a story that actually was not about me Alice is the narrator of their story and so I painted pictures of what the people went through to go to freedom and that also allowed me to get donations and so I got thirty thousand I wanted just the trip just to get to the lesbos which is in the Greek islands it 's between Turkey and Greece and it 's the shortest route it 's about ten about ten eleven kilometers on a journey across the ocean so the people who are escaping the war were taking this journey for freedom they 're putting themselves in boats up to 80 per boat with fake lifejackets sold by smugglers full of box wrapping styrofoam and other things but packaged on legitimate one you 'd buy at Burke Marine but when you sink in the water it takes 30 seconds to drown in Australia it was taking 18 seconds for them so 18 seconds is what they have and when when they 're escaping you gotta remember you take all your gear with you so you think you sink very fast again I learnt life-saving what do we have in life-saving we have we have jet skis we have boats and so when I ended up getting a lot more money than I had thought of I mean how can I solve this problem how can I go from 18 second how can I solve this 18 second thing because those medical containers you know MSF Doctors Without Borders were there so I simply applied the fastest way possible and what we do in lifestyle Victoria is we have different jet ski teams so I built a rapid response team it was taking ten minutes to launch a boat and to be on the scene to assess and save up to a hundred people with the jet skis we got it we were able to make it out to about 25 seconds because of the rapid response where we could put floats and save their lives now I used every bit of random knowledge that I 've learned through many communities through schooling through diplomas and that to just apply my skills to the world you know whether you 're a lifesaver in a surf lifesaving Club you 're a part of the SES you know some Johns Ambulance person you work for counsel you 're a plumber and that 's the other thing being in a humanitarian crisis you don 't need to be a lifesaver to save a life the guy who digs the toilet saves more lives than the actual people in the front line because health and sanitation is all about making sure everyone is not spreading disease and he 's actually being in an environment that allows for them to move on and be processed and go forward but I wasn 't done because what I learned is that when you help one group of people you open to helping everyone and so then I saw off the coast of Libya and then in itself is its own beast of of the worst of humanity and the best of humanity simply you have people who have going in the ocean going 50 kilometers until they run out of fuel on a compass bearing and just sitting there waiting for rescue needle in a haystack and sadly thousands upon thousands of people who have died but when they wake up in the morning they make a single choice today I 've got a 50 chances of survival on a 50 chance of making a difference for my lives of my children and the lives of my family why would you not risk it so they do and sadly we can 't_''_1766.76 say for everyone but when we do save people they say thank you with a handshake and they look you in the eye they nod and not a single word is spoken but you understand the message that they deliver you know I was lucky I was able to rescue 1906 people more people than this crowd today but the crowd today is essentially what we on one on a13 wooden boat sitting 60 kilometers off Libya just hoping for rescue taking on water and sinking but the thing was is that I was an Australian working for a German NGO with a Spanish rescue crew off the coast of Libya controlled by the Italians rescuing Africans who can speak French now that complex mess is is certainly what Australia is we have many cultures we are multicultural but being Australian taught me how to learn that Spain is made up of two countries Basque Country and the rest of Spain and don 't get it they 're very very passionate about but even that you know what we 've launched in Australia what we 've learnt in our communities is that you can engage with the French person you can engage with the Spaniard you can engage with the Italian the German because every day it doesn 't care what your background is you know you make a difference to be engaged with each other whether it is buying that you know German sausage or buying there you know the pork roll or by buying 's not where we come from it 's how we use it to be part of our lives and that 's why the whole journey of rescuing people the whole journey of using my skills I simply started as a lifesaver I simply started going to school and I simply did just simple things that resulted in bigger achievements but the bigger achievements only came from just achieving it things every day the whole journey has taught me if Humanity is seen by many but it is only action by some you can all be that action and I 've seen it in that community last night whether you were there to be part of the inspiration and inspire John or you 're there to support the fellow council the councillors the mayor CEO and the wonderful volunteers who actually have made the hooked on Portland a very wonderful event but whatever you do you can change the world by taking those small steps so thank you thank you so much Simon it 's always enjoyable to hear our ambassadors talk and reflect on the difference that they 've made with a gift in appreciation so we 're just going to before we move on to the awards we 're going to invite Melissa back and we 're going to hope Simon that there is a 50 chance of us not getting wet so I 'll hand over to you Melissa thank you [Music] I 've in the cities and Neville rules now Oh [Music] I still call [Music] always travel my heart lies way [Music] Oh [Music] oh yeah [Music] and someday we 'll all be together once more ships come back too soon and I realized something [Music] Oh [Music] but no matter [Music] Thank You Melissa I think everything 's coming together as someone said was that planned and I think I know it 's just that 's the way it is isn 't it it reflects on why we 're here in that community spirit that you talked about so we 're now going to move on to some more community spirit with the Australia Day Awards an important part of Australia Day is to recognize and celebrate our local community and volunteers last year we calling for nominations for the current year in the categories of community group of the year senior citizen the year young citizen year and citizen of the year and I 'd also like to acknowledge last year 's recipients who may be here today as well and thank them for their contribution that they 've made solution of the War wards was undertaken from the Advisory Committee based on people 's and groups exceptional contribution to our community we are proud to present these awards as they acknowledge individuals who have made an outstanding contribution and the positive differences you talked about Simon in our community so we 're now going to move on to the announcement of the community group of the year for the Glenelg Shire the recipients of this award have provided service to seafarers visiting the Port of Portland for over 50 years 8,000 seafarers have visited Portland each year on 350 vessels with the minimum stay of 3 to 7 days this community group is open every the day of the year and supports the welfare of seafarers under the maritime Convention Bill of Rights 5000 bus trips annually and a run by a team of dedicated 20 volunteers as part of this program they are a nonprofit organization and received no government funding congratulations to the members of the flying angel Portland Inc or commonly known the mission to seafarers I invite you to come to the stage to collect your award congratulations I 'm going to invite Simon to participate and hand over the wards to Neville and members of the mission to seafarers make the presentation and if you 'd like to come forward and make some comments you 're most welcome thank you my rank and councillors and to Simon your speech was very inspiring something similar to what the mission to seafarers does where we dealing with overseas seafarers are not necessarily Australians so I 've written a little response here so I hope you don 't mind we 'll take a couple seconds to read through so thank you on behalf of our wonderful hard-working and generous volunteers you were know some who are here today the orange army and my wife and family for putting up with my to acknowledge past volunteers managers chaplains and committee members some of their volunteers have been volunteering at the mission for over 25 years also the generous support from the Port of Portland in particular Jim Cooper and current CEO Greg Trenholm and when five years ago I met with Jim and Greg I said the mission could not survive the property here in Cliff 's tree had been sold from under us we lost our main source of revenue leasing the property we were trading insolvent and you bent over backwards to help us financially to secure airport shuttle service and to continue to provide a premises inside the port for the mission to operate I wish to thank the previous chaplain Padre Roy Howe for his vision in relocating the mission inside the port a move that has been very successful in terms of the changing ways that ships operate fast turnaround and the increase in number of seafarers that visit the center thanks to the respect that Roy established we are very lucky to have such great support from the churches local businesses shipping agencies customs quarantine pilots case in in other missions in in Australian around the world I know there will be some critics that will say that we support seafarers not locals or Australians rather than international seafarers from countries around the work world so let me say this on Australia Day the mission has operated in Portland for over 50 years without seafarers you you would not be wearing the clothes you have the food that you eat the TV that you watch over 95% of trade is handled by a Seafarer the port and associated interest industries such as the timber industry has grown to be one of the largest employers and and would not be so without seafarers the mission receives no government funding so why do we do what we do because it 's the Aussie thing to help you mate regardless of who you are or where you come from no matter of your religion your race or your Creed the flying angel logo is recognized around the world and is highly regarded as a welfare agency that fights for the basic human rights of seafarers thankfully we don 't of abandonment unpaid wages privacy piracy I should say seaworthiness of vessels lack of food and other issues seafarers are the lowest paid hardest workers away from my family for up to nine months per year in a foreign country seafarers are very much a part of our community and spend money in our local businesses we were pleased to hold the regional national conference here in Portland in 2017 with 50 delegates attending from around Australia New Zealand Fiji and London which was a huge success and showcased all that Portland has to offer we are proud to be part of your community and it supported the cruise ship visitors visits coordinated the blessing of the fleet as part of the upwelling festival and support other community organizations such as the Navy Cadets and the volunteer Coast Guard Paula mission has also established partnerships to support our the much smaller Australian missions Hastings and Port Giles and we 're excited to have just entered a partnership with Monrovia in Libya Africa so when you see is he for you in town stop and say g 'day_''_2647.17 how you going and I working to make a living and to help their families thank you congratulations and

health services and above all our communities health and well-being over the past year together we have faced adversity we 've embraced new opportunities and we 've overcome substantial challenges by working together with new initiatives programs and services that have been quickly implemented to help those in need from medication and grocery delivery care packages online music therapy virtual

like to see more of her work you can go onto her facebook page and check it out an important part of australia day is to recognise and celebrate our local community and volunteers last year council undertook a long and broad advertising campaign starting on the 27th of january calling for nominations for the australia day awards in the categories of community group senior citizen of the year young citizen of the year and citizen of the year selections of the awards were undertaken by the australia day committee based on a person present these awards as they acknowledge individuals who are extending role models and who have made a positive difference to our communities may i take this time also to thank those who submitted the nominations and i may i congratulate all nominees the nominations were such a high caliber and it made this selection quite difficult each of you have contributed in extraordinary ways and you 're all winners an important part of australia day is to recognise and celebrate our local community and one of the ways of doing that is by the australia day ambassador program however we 'll be doing things slightly differently this year australia day ambassadors are past recipients of the australia of the year awards their sports people scientists business people actors and community workers who provide inspiration and pride on australia day this year the australia council has put together an ambassador program by a virtual message and one of those ambassadors is major brendan nottle commanding office officer of the salvation army in melbourne and the 2020 victorian australian of the year finalist as a commanding officer of the salvation army major working with the vulnerable members of our society leading the salvo melbourne project 614 he worked with a team of over a thousand volunteers to help people who were homeless suffering from mental health issues addiction and social poverty going out on the streets of melbourne brendan and his team provided practical support including meals clothing and counselling as well as well as working with clients to connect them with services that can facilitate the transition back to society but most importantly most importantly he forges one-on-one connections that help people feel less marginalized brendan is a member of the premier 's ice action task force and the victorian housing minister 's rough sleep round table and frequently advocates on issues facing the risks that homelessness face in 2013 he was named melbourne of the year in recognition of his tireless efforts to support disadvantaged people we are now going to see an address by the australia day ambassador major brendan nottle thank you to begin i would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we are meeting wherever you may be today and i pay 's great about australia day one it 's an opportunity for us to celebrate the fact that we look out for each other especially when our backs are against the wall too it 's an opportunity for us to celebrate our indigenous culture which is the longest surviving culture of anywhere in the world and that 's something we should be incredibly proud of and something that we should celebrate my grandmother was seven half months pregnant with my mum back in 1928 and she had three little kids and uh her husband died at a pretty young age and he had some pretty serious addictions so he left very little money in the bank for the family and it was the local salvos that turned up with a box of food and i think the salvos were back then incredibly helpful to our family and so it almost got embedded in our dna one of the things for me is there are an increasing number of australians that feel overwhelmingly isolated and i i think that 's one of the drivers for me is what can i do to and when you you just spend time with people and uh when you actually see them not just uh emotionally doing better but actually physically they 're upright they 're able to look you in the eye and you think wow you know i 've actually had some some sort of impact here on this person 's life that drives me to to actually do more i think one of the things about australia is we 've actually led the way when it comes to addressing covert and i think we 're a we 're a world leader in that area there 's no question about that but i think where we 're leading the world is also in the area of the way that we 've looked out for each other i think that 's absolutely critical and i think it 's one of the things that we often overlook but we are remarkable in looking out for those that have been given up on we 're remarkable and looking out for those that have fallen through the gaps and that 's something that we 're great at but great at going forward so this australia day i 'd really encourage you to think about someone that feels like they 've just been given up on pick up the phone go and have a coffee with them and remind them that they count and that you care reflect respect [Music] celebrate i think that 's a great presentation and reflects what australia day means and some great messaging there um i think we all know brendan and the work that he does and uh and we 're grateful for that work um we 're now going to ask jess to come back being one of the finalists um to perform again jess as the video suggested is one of the familiar faces as part of the glen elkshai 's musical mates she also plays at the united church arts program music and me program and sing alongs at harbourside lodge so we 'd like to welcome jess back to entertain us give her a big round of applause thank you very much [Applause] i was asked to sing a song about community so i thought this one was quite moving to portland and starting a family here because it 's a wonderful place to be so this is my family tree song can you feel it in the air i feel it everywhere i think it 's time i found a place to settle down wheels have been turning round in and out of many towns and now time to find out patchy ground let 's sow some seeds grow a family tree they 'll look like you and me slow down slow down watch them grow up grow up this town small town lots of land and love love let 's sew some seeds grow a family tree they 'll look like you and me [Music] let 's sow some seeds grow a family tree let 's stay right here where the grass yet i you and me [Music] right here where the grass is green thank you very much [Applause] thank you very much jess now we 'll move on to the awards and it gives me great pleasure in

church as a bail justice and a jp but i 've also helped out at schools and for the car club and all of those things and i think it 's one of those things that makes our community is the amount of

page whether you were someone that posted videos or simply supported and encouraged the musical activity i thank you all i 'm forever grateful for my parents loving encouragement guidance and patience when it came to my musical endeavors that gave me the confidence to study music and develop my musicianship 2020 will be a year that we all remember for many reasons there are moments that we wish to put behind us and there are moments that we wish to cherish during our initial isolation the one thing that could connect us all many ways was music staying a saturday night and then being able to watch it again on replay show the invaluable benefits of connection the page took off very quickly at the start as people could see how much fun it was and they wanted to be part of it it required a very strong admin team to assist and maintain the integrity of the page and to make sure it remained true to the initial purpose of the page which was purely to connect to locals through music there is no way i i could have done this on my own and i wish to acknowledge the incredible support i received from my musical mates the admin team kerry colliver trish thompson jess cook sophie von tunk dean atrium david bartel and a massive massive shout out to my right-hand man german oakley who was regularly on speed dial for tech support till early hours of most mornings i would also like to thank the assistance i get from business and industry in in portland the musical mates community made a safe place for people to feel comfortable to share their voice in song before our eyes why because they are heard supported and encouraged by their musical mates community it gave people a positive focus to get through their day in which it was a very trying time for all it 's extremely beautiful to know that family members and friends interstate and around the world were able to see their person perform from afar in a supportive musical environment and receiving such warm responses from so many musical mates has also rekindled the love of music in the hearts of many musicians that haven 't played in years inspired community members to take up an instrument to sing again or to simply stop rest and listen to their favorite song musical mates is inclusive of all people that was one of my highlights for me seeing such musical diversity on the page for some people that was the first time they had ever shared their love of music with anyone for others it was a familiar feeling in an unfamiliar setting either way the musical mates was was and still is an uplifting positive experience for all that are involved on the silently engaging admins see the activity on our page and we are delighted that approximately 3 000 people per day check in on their musical mates you may

    "text": "hi i 'm sarah from glenelg libraries and thank you for joining us today for an introduction to ancestry.com so what is ancestry.com ancestry.com is a free online research database it 's available through our glennard library 's website what can it do so you can search birth deaths and marriages records military records passenger lists and census lists and probably a little bit more to research your family history i hope the following tutorial will get you started on your family history journey susan is going to show you how to log onto the website how to navigate the website and give you some tips and pointers on how to begin your search thank you for joining us welcome i 'm susan and today i 'll be showing you how to use ancestry library edition and sharing some tips to help you enjoy researching your family history now just to be aware that from home you will be able to have access to ancestry library until december the 31st so take up this time and this opportunity to be able to use this normally it would be in the to get started you 'll need to put in the library 's website so the library 's website is www.glenelg libraries.vic.gov dot a u once you 've typed that in then you 'll come to this screen and uh so if we go to resources where i put the cursor and come down to online research click on that that will take us to this screen where we have at the top ancestry library edition so if we again come down a little and log in here to access ancestry library edition we 'll need to put in our library card number and a password of course one more click click here to access ancestry library edition and here we come to this front screen you can see across here we have a number of different tabs telling um indicating different information so search allows us different access points where we can specifically search through different types of lists the one i would like to draw your attention to is charts and forms so here we can see an ancestral chart which we might like to download and fill that history that you have all right so back to the front screen the home screen on this screen too you can scroll down and you can see here down the bottom that there are a number of other ways to get to those same links i 'll more about that later first up though we 'll begin searching and just clicking on that big green button right and just also to show that there are is a basic search here but to show more options you can click on that there all right i 'm going to um also indicate that um when you 're searching um be aware that there are various different spellings so um what has been come down through the generations might not have been how the name originally began so just be aware of that as you 're searching and something else to be mindful of is that um to double check your results against other findings so maybe if you have a marriage certificate to check the information there of the different people with their names and then to check it against say a you 've got the same person that so i 'm going to pee an ancestor of mine just to give an example of some of the types of records that you can find his name is frank richard uphill i know he lived in around the fort mcdonald area but i 'll put south australia and that he was born in 1869 now it also has options with these uh other options that we 've opened up that you can put a father a mother sibling spouse or child so if you click on those it opens up i know that he 's wife was her name was ellen lydia and herself or her maiden name rather was embarry so let 's see what we find for frank richard just to be aware too you can explore by location so if your ancestors were from other areas you can click on different maps and it should default to different searches so go back to australia we 'll do the search on frank richard and we 'll see it displays 20 results with um 822 records that potentially um are there so um the first one i 'd like to show you the type of record that you can bring up so an australian world or one service record so if we click on this image here you 'll see um something in very bold so if we go over to the right and click on the minus we can bring it down to a size where we can actually see what the information is so australian military forces um attestation paper of persons enlisted for service abroad so this was from the first world war and if we go either side we find out all sorts of information that uh about frank richard and we can i have been in here before so i 'm changing the page number we can go to a specific page number and bring up different information so here we can see that he actually died of malaria back in 1918. okay so i 'm just going to go out of there and just see what other information that we can find about frank richards all sorts of things i 'm going to um just a grave and it actually displays the um a photo of the graveside and we can see he was in the cemetery in beirut so the actual information is there go back okay so if we look at marriage index it doesn 't bring up the marriage certificate but it supplies some information that you would find on the marriage certificate so we can see from this his father 's name his spouse 's name spouse 's father 's name the marriage date and where the marriage took place all right so what we 're doing is building more data and more detail about this person now there 's an awful lot more information that could be retrieved from there but just to go back to oops the front screen again okay back on the front screen we have as i said before quick links and another thing to that might be of help to you are the public member trees now just to be aware i 'll click on there but just to be aware that there is a disclaimer from ancestry library edition that they cannot guarantee the submitted but you accept the data as it is and then verify it against other access points so i 'm just going to again go in under frank richard uphill and we 'll see if someone else has loaded any information i 'm just going to leave it at that and see what we can find searches now um it appears as though he appears in a couple of family trees we can see here um george uphill which was listed in one of the previous records the marriage record so if we click on here and this is a wonderful resource but again as um as mentioned before you need to check the information and so you can go up or down the family tree um so frank ritu it gives information down this right side about his family so his parents his children if we were to click on his one of his parents it then brings the parent 's name to the top and the connections to and so on so you can keep going until it goes no further now obviously sometimes you 'll come to to find ways of maybe looking sideways looking at other information that will find information for you it was really exciting when one of the other staff was looking through her family tree and she found that um one of her forebears appeared on one of these assisted and unassisted passenger lists and just had a quick look at that the gentleman 's name was john bipond so if we can bring that up and it 's a little bit hard to read whoops we 've gone the wrong way there but sorry to do this to your eyes but what we found over here john bipond um he was a coach builder so uh he was an adult when he came out and um it just um made things come alive so he was uh 30 and um other information where the different people have come from english irish scottish or foreign so all sorts of different records that can be um gathered from um ancestry library edition we were also amused to find that um walter healey again another ancestor of one of the staff here appeared in up um walter charles healey um birth 1889 [Music] again um i 've just got to find where he appears here he 's here sorry about that um so attempted breaking and entering with intent three years probation and prohibited all sorts of information so physical characteristics about the hair and the eye color and um i think medium refers to oh no it 's not filled so um interesting so scar above left ankle and it looks as though he appeared in another police gazette too so he 's got a bit of a checkered history that one okay another thing to be aware of is that from time to time uh new data and new information is added so if you go to the new collections you can actually see that records are being updated all the time and more information is being added so in summing up i would say that periodically repeat researches as new data can appear again as i mentioned at the start be mindful of various spellings also that either putting in too much information not enough information can affect the types of other findings so that you can verify them and don 't forget to record your information so that you can hand that information on to other people i hope this has been helpful to you and happy hunting you _"

found in Australia sandals bit confused and that 's why it was such a good opportunity to move down to Hayward because it 's my country in a very strong spiritual connection English to our country that 's that 's what people need to understand about about Aboriginal occupation of Australia that it 's very long-standing we were talking at a minimum of 60 thousand years probably a lot longer than that as technology improves that occupation and continuing connection to country that 's really important the people that I belong to the Gilgal good each people were along the lava flow and so we know that the lava flow is resource rich in food sources resource rich in materials so we were able to build hermit housing the men who have manipulated the landscape to make food gathering a lot of you here particularly the fish and the eels and we lived a structured lifestyle the food resource in western Victoria was was extremely rich plenty of water in fact if you look at the budget people lava fly for example where we reconstructed permanent dwellings in in stone houses and where we constructed the stone fish traps and a very large scale that was purely because there was a great water supply and therefore a great food resource that was Erin and enabled good niche power of people over many thousands of years to construct these permanent places and it was because there was that great resource based on the the rivairy reliable water supply you can see actual evidence in the stones and thousands of years old a lot other places you go to you can hear stories about things that are thousand-year-old and what happened here thousands of years but we can actually point to when you can go point to a place and say you know there 's been people sleeping in this little circle here for 8,000 years yeah Oh people actually slept in that little circle that could happen for 8,000 years Wow you can Charlie 's fish that we were fished and hunted so we 're lucky that the rocks the rocks really have saved us in acknowledging the rocks is still there in the land and that 's the way it was for thousands of generations and till the sailors come along and of course the year ago and it 's from Portland sad and never out of Portland to project their women from the sealers and took them up to CAC bondage and the next thing that happened was the 1832 convincing ground Massacre all of the kill Cara but two people were killed and that coincided with the settlers and the squatters bringing their sheep grounds and putting their sheep on it not just a kangaroo who eats the kangaroo grass but the Sheep as well so by destroying our kangaroo hunting grounds that are replacing the sheep on it and then thought well we 're just got to go out and take a sheep instead of going hunting for kangaroo and of course the settlers the squatter which would then retaliate I mean it might have been just two sheep that you took but when they come in looking for it they 'd kill for five times as many people in retaliation or taking their sheep now there are 37 registered Massacre sites just on our country there are many that haven 't been recorded so you know and numbers which were great because we were on such a resourceful landscape declined very quickly but wasn 't just the massacres it was the introduction of the common cold measles chicken pox smallpox took a lot of our people so the combination of all of those that really decimated the Gunda genera the mission was built in 1866 and all the ghanoush malva rounded up the banks of the Kara the canal River they were brought across and placed on like Conda mission you might think that was a lot there was actually only seven people in total you know that 's not even the population of my my family group which is very small bill Gurgaon ditch we numbered between forty six hundred people was the mission good for people that 's it that 's a fundamental question people ask now I look at it sometimes my god yeah isn 't that the worst place that have happened to us yeah look what they did to us they stopped us talking our language they stopped us doing this they stopped us doing that they try to replace things with these Christian beliefs and Christian values and all these other things but it also was the only reason we survived because the devastation of our people was was huge now if even if you believe there was 1,000 good amount of people which is one of the lowest estimates you can do the most people who ever made on like Condor mission 130 that 's number now people talk about there being up to 10,000 good Gemara people now if that 's the case we don 't talk about point one three percent of survival rate come along it become a place where they still try to do more things to us but the one thing they didn 't do was break our families as much as I could one of the things that you couldn 't do was teach your traditional arts crafts beliefs to your children so my grandmother didn 't teach my aunt Ida Kiley hard to basket weave she had the sneak around and look around corners go and steal a stitch or two when the women went in for a cuppa but I was able to pass it down to my grandchildren and they always all my granddaughters weave I think it 's very important to know listen and learn and then be able to pass that knowledge and those stories on you know to future generations and my sisters and you know cousins who don 't live on country but when they visit you know it 's good to reg is an iconic Aboriginal man Cornish Mara and his father Chris honours was in World War one and rich was in World War two and became a captain in the Australian Army in Korea and the only Aboriginal commissioned captain at that time so you know obviously an outstanding leader to be appointed in you know for an Aboriginal man to be appointed to that type of Commission it just demonstrates that the type of character the man was visit Canberra you hear of the stories of the leadership he 's done for Aboriginal people across Australia not just for our people but for all Aboriginal people was legendary and many of us wouldn 't be doing the stuff we are today without that leadership from bridges the future looks really strong you know the conversation around treaty is really really important to me and people get understanding what treaty is about you know and it 's not about taking things from people it 's about growing communities and things that impact on Aboriginal people today still is over representation in the criminal justice system and in the early is really important to be a sustainable person that participates in the world we live in here today so reconciliation is a big part of that and that 's why you know this whole you know this year 's reconciliation week I think is so important yeah we 've got to get the truth out there because the truth will you know like I say will set us free and that 's what it does to happen I just love it don 't keep his dream mystery come learn share and grow but be prepared to open your eyes I reckon to open your hope in your years and to be receptive to a different point of view or another point of view that you may not have heard before that and to come in on country we can 't lose sight of the past when thinking about our future because those mistakes that have been made by us or by other people towards us should not be forgotten should be forgiven that taken forward [Music] simply don 't hate history a mystery you know we 've almost lost our their stories and knowledge and we don 't want it to happen again you know pretty much we 're moving forward now we can reconciliate and come together as one the Glenelg Shire has been working with our indigenous partners for many years through our Aboriginal Advisory Committee but it 's only now that we are truly making inroads to acknowledging the traditional owners of the land and waters of the good deeds Amara people reconciliation week is a really good opportunity for us to acknowledge the important contribution that Aboriginal people make to our cultural identity we have a responsibility to keep our history alive and to tell the story of the original inhabitants together we need to continue on our journey for true reconciliation [Music] you [Music] _"

Tony right Tony is the associate editor and special writer for both the Aged and The Sydney Morning Herald he was born in Hayward and was raised in schooled at Hayward portland and hamilton tony has been a journalist since 1970 where he started as a cadet reporter at the portland observer since his cadetship he has worked at numerous newspapers and magazines in region regional and metropolitan australia he is a member of the federal press gallery since 1989 when he became the chief political correspondent for the Canberra Times he has covered 13 federal elections since 1983 and numerous state elections and is known and traveled with seven prime ministers he has since worked as a senior writer foreign affairs correspondent political correspondent and national affairs editor for The Sydney Morning Herald The Bulletin magazine and the age he has reported from them from some of the most world 's war-torn areas and has Portland and Hayward district home and with his family and friends and spares and spends spare time here and his house by the beach here in Portland ladies and gentlemen please welcome mr. Tony right Thank You mayor and congratulations to to Claire it 's kind of nice to hear say a good story come out of the term citizenship after what happened last year in Canberra and good morning Portland I woke this morning to a big Sun rising over a wide sea a couple of boats fishing bobbing about and afraid her lying at anchor in the other direction cattle grazed beneath the grassed Hill and then of course this being Portland clouds blew over and the weather changed people in Melbourne seemed surprised that I 'm so keen to travel for hours most weekends to this area and that I spend my annual summer holidays here it 's actually pretty simple this is where I feel I belong when I 'm driving towards this place and I crest our Hill over there near Warrnambool and look west I start to breathe differently I 'm home but why 's Australia Day Australia day between the barbecues and the afternoon nap and the knowledge that the summer break is coming to an end is a chance for us to cogitate on where we 've been where we are and where we might be going in this country we call home I 'm lucky enough as a journalist to be able to get out of the office pretty regularly and to wander about trying to figure out this nation through its stories it 's a better way than asking politicians to explain the place could anyone imagine them agreeing on anything a few months ago I visited a place near were dongho that has had a lasting effect on Australia 's modern history it 's called born Aguila it 's an Aboriginal word that 's supposed to mean deep water hole but to most people who lived there after the Second World War it 's pronounced Bourne Nagila and means the first place I tasted fatty mutton it was from 1947 to 1972 Australia 's bigger biggest migrant reception centre 3 of a million people from around 170 countries started there back in the early 1980s when I worked at the Aubrey paper I discovered there were plans to bulldoze the last of those huts it seemed to me that bulldozing such an important part of Australia 's history was a very poor idea so I wrote a series of stories based on interviews with dozens of people who had lived there before setting out to build new lives in Australia almost all of them came from countries wrecked by war and conflict and the resulting disappearance of opportunities the sort of stories that never seemed to end and continue right now their stories sparked new interest in the old place and an entire section of that camp was kept intact and turned into a museum and a visitor 's centre I felt a small sense of distant guardianship of bono Geller ever since when I visited there last year it was the 70th anniversary of the day in 1947 when mana Giller opened its gates to the world i sat down with an old man who as a boy spoke no English but came from a war ruined Germany big projects that built the new country dams electricity plants and the rest and some years ago he 'd left Australia to live in America with an American bride but he told me he found he was restless and unhappy in America and he and his wife had come back to Australia and settled in a country town he had discovered he said that Australia was home despite finding at bewildering and uncompromising and unpromising when he was a young man he 'd come back to visit Vaughn Gila to relive his start in the country that had captured his heart emigration of course has always been the story of Australia often like right now it 's been the source of much controversy and pain all parts of my own family arrived here in southwest Victoria in the 1840s and 1850s and often think of the loneliness experienced and the toil that went into building new lives burdened with the knowledge that they 'll never see the places of their birth again I think too every time I take a dip in the ocean or drift along a near deserted chosen this district to settle last year I spent a few days a long way away beneath a vast artwork daubed sandstone rock shelter in the northern Australian bush where the ideas of time and home took on entirely different meanings I was taken to a secret place in kakadu national park by an archaeologist professor chris clarkson who had been digging there for some years at an old campsite as they dug down Clarkson 's team came up with thousands of artifacts food scraps shells the remainders of campfires 13 human skeletons grinding stones and axe heads right at the bottom layer two and a half metres beneath what is the surface today lay an axe head next to a grinding stone left as if it were yesterday that axe had turned out through the oldest tool with a ground blade ever discovered anywhere in the world by testing and retesting no less than 28-thousand 5-hundred separate grains of sand each that turns out as a tiny time capsule scientists discovered that the bottom of that archaeological dig where the axe head lay was 65 thousand years old that the story and it went around the world the knowledge that Aboriginal people were in Australia sixty-five thousand years ago means they were here more than 20,000 years before the first humans arrived in Europe put another way they were here almost 50,000 years before the first humans found their way to the Americas down here in Southwest Victoria we don 't need to be persuaded about the ancient nature of indigenous occupation right on our doorstep is one of the wonders evidence of engineering works in the stones of bosom around Lake condor and Turin Dara the constitute the oldest known aquaculture works in the world last week an old mate of mine from politics came tramping through our district he 's walking from Geelong to Adelaide and he stayed a couple of night my night of nights at my house on the coast here I was anxious to give him a quick education about our area of the world I led him around these lovely old blue stone buildings explaining how Portland was the first European settlement in Victoria showed in the plowed field up there and talked him out the Cape Nelson to introduce him to some of the most dramatically beautiful cliffs and seascapes anywhere and we went out to tour and Dara we crossed Dalitz Creek and wandered through a great silence surrounded by the remnants of stone villages and handmade channels and beers and eel traps of this area that are a minimum of six thousand seven hundred years old or almost three thousand years older than the oldest part of Stonehenge I wanted my friend to get a bit of an idea of the real history of the southwest I tried to explain the brutal tragedy of what had happened when European settlers took the lands of the people who had survived for var sweeps of time in this landscape and I tried to explain how against fearful odds the gun Dutch Mara and other people 's had remained a living culture around here and how I had the great fortune to have gone to school with some of these people and learned a few of their stories my friend was undertaking his merit walk in the footsteps of an adventurer who became Adelaide as a boy in the 1880s and wrote a little book about the trick called the diary of a but like the people of his time he had somehow failed to notice that he was surrounded by a heritage that was as old and rich as forever and so I wanted to bring my friend up to date today of course we recognized that Bujji BIM the ancient lava flow of what we knew as mound Eccles and which became the citadel of the gunther gunder tomorrow is so significant that it is on the way to becoming Australia 's latest world heritage site up there with uluru kakadu the Great Barrier Reef and the ruins of convict convict prisons in Tasmania you know said my friend the long-distance Walker we 're not finished showing him around and we 're sitting back having a beer this whole area is one of the most fascinating places anywhere yes I said I know it 's my home Australia Day Australia Day is a day to think about all this and about how Australia has evolved to the successful democracy and economy heated and growing national argument about whether the 26th of January the date a fleet of British castoffs arrived only in 1788 123 years before Australia actually became a nation with that name and whether it 's an appropriate date for our national day it seems to me that if modern Australia can unlock ancient secrets through a single grain of sand that it 's not beyond us to recognize that if there is something as simple as a date and the calendar dividing us then we can deal with it meanwhile here we are Australia Day in one of the most fascinating and beautiful areas of our old old country our home thank you Tony could I just invite you back to the lectern I just wanted to take this opportunity it 's obvious that Tony is a very good storyteller as well as story writer so I thought I 'd take this opportunity if you don 't mind just to ask you a couple of questions no not likely um Tony I suppose you didn 't touch much on politics but um and I suppose it 's fair suppose yeah I suppose disillusioned with federal politics with regards to what they anticipate leaders are supposed to do instead of you know becoming involved in political RG bhaji over your time who would you consider as an example of you know one of the good leaders that you 've come across some and it doesn 't matter which political party or whatever but who did you who stood out to you as one of our our best leaders all leaders are different level grab different styles hawky was pretty interesting because he was a bloke who was about consensus he would let everyone around him have have a view and let them voice it and then he 'd make a decision and he and Keating stick to it and that and that worked very well for a long time John Howard was a completely different form of leader but he had an instinct about what he believed Australians wanted and and and and would and would back now I didn 't agree with him or I didn 't agree with all on everything either but he managed to hold any beat Mark Latham which is worth knowing save this saved us all together and then of course we had that sort of bizarre period of Rawdon Gillard and Rudd and Tony Abbott now we 've got Malcolm Turnbull so I guess I 'm being a bit I 'm reminiscing a bit by going back to hawk and Howard but both of them managed to hold their governments together for long periods and you can do things when you 've when you 're in government for a long period you 're in government for a short period you become very short-sighted and things don 't get done have you ever been kicked out of the press gallery have you ever been kicked down depressed gallery no I haven 't been kicked out of the press calorie I certainly have had a few run-ins with with politicians and others Paul Keating was fairly keen on ringing me up and giving me a free character assessment quite regularly when when I was a political correspondent of The Sydney Morning Herald which of course was his local newspaper in Sydney and he would start the conversation or even how he would continue it because I 'd probably be get arrested for the use of language but it was a fascinating experience to be to be yelled at by Keating he would he would go for about 45 minutes my parents used to come up and know it he listened damaging Jenny when running the country and it says it here in a list of the things that you have done that you once spent a morning in the palace in Edinburgh Scotland chatting with about horse racing with the Queen I did I was in as in Edinburgh for a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and I got this invitation and it said you know a reception with the Queen and I 'd seen what those sort of receptions were previously about 700 people in the TR are bobbing down the other end of the room somewhere and I wasn 't very keen on going but a colleague of mine Jim Middleton from the ABC said well you know the choices we go to this or John Howard press conference so off we only 30 journalists invited and there was the Queen Prince Philip and Princess Anne and it was I I had a hangover I 've got to admit I had a bit of an evening out with some Scots the night before and you can imagine what that led to anyway yeah we 're each given a nice little tin tea cup with tea in it and mine would be Guinea rattled and the Queen came over and said you don 't really want that tea do you a small sherry perhaps we 'd sort of break the ice and anyway I knew that she had a couple of horses out in Australia for the upcoming Melbourne Cup so I asked her about those and and she could became quite effusive and talked about how wonderful who that wonderfully well the horses had travelled and and how she was quite optimistic of a good run and so forth and and then of course the time went on and and and she had to move off to another group and I found myself with Prince Philip and I said I 'll look there for the Melbourne Cup are in pretty good shape will it be worth having a bob on them dummy bloody stupid they 're both got colic they travel very badly and I have no idea why she 's got them there and and it became a fascinating morning as time went by it also it also says that here you are you 'd like to share a bottle of reds with malcolm turnbull unfortunately this is not a bottle of Granger like a bottle of local red so thank you very much Tony

    "text": "i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land that we 're meeting on the jaja rung and pay my respects to leaders and elders past present and emerging this week we 're celebrating national volunteer week it 's the biggest australian celebration of volunteering that we have annually and we know that people have been volunteering across the city of greater bendigo in huge numbers and i 'd love to thank people for all those efforts over a long period of time people volunteer across activities to do in the city of greater bendigo and also across a range of community organisations we know that we 've got about 23 percent of people in our community volunteer and we know from census data in 2016 that compares to 19 across the state of victoria so we 're here to help we 're very active and interested in our contributions and that culture of contributing and volunteering is very strong in bendigo we 've got a community volunteering strategy and that 's important because we as we come out of a pandemic we 've got a range of culture of volunteering this video will enable people to find out a lot more about what that looks like not only across the city go to bendigo 's activities but also across a range of organisations in our community this week 's volunteer week activities are framed around three things of recognising reconnecting and reimagining volunteers give the gift of their time and talents to support others in the community and i think it 's important to say thank you very important to say thank you i think it 's super super important to recognize volunteers because the work that they do is honestly in value they play such a vital part of the day-to-day functioning where it 's absolutely necessary to acknowledge and to recognise the wonderful work of our volunteers so it 's important to say thank you and do that privately to the volunteer but also publicly i think it 's really important to say thank you and to acknowledge them publicly whether it 's a morning tea or something in the larger scale couldn 't exist without the support the active participation passion the interest of volunteers that have carried us through those most difficult times it 's very rewarding it makes me feel good because i 'm helping other people and it gets me involved in the community being able to go home at the end of the day and just how many people did we make happy today it 's like we have one big happy family and so for us a lot about reconnection is really about starting to reassess where we 're at as an organization what needs have emerged within the community it 's important that we connect with them and you actually have to reach out and remind them how important being part of the community is we need to really revisit that when we engage their volunteers to ensure where everyone 's at at this time we kept in touch with all of our volunteers by our team emails but also individual welfare calls we wanted to make sure that they were traveling okay we 're going to have to work really hard to make sure that we get our current volunteers back but also that we open up volunteer work couldn 't continue obviously because of code and we need to make sure we 're getting those people back into the room when we were able to go back and work and study and do our volunteer cooking that was easy because everyone was desperate to get out of their homes desperate to get away from the tv and come back to work and do something fulfilling corvette 19 has brought a lot of challenges but it also opens many new ways of doing things we did create some remote opportunities so some of our volunteers were doing zoom calls with our aged care residents i think we need to consider potential partnerships within our communities to try and share volunteers or think differently about the way that we do things i 've been able to continue volunteering despite the pandemic in fact the pandemic has made me more active in the community through online channels i use social media to translate a number of coveted messaging from english to my native language even though we don 't need to do video calls all the time right now wonderful opportunity to review their programs and look at how we can make them different make them flexible to encourage people from all walks of life we had community members who were in isolation so it was really rethinking how we could use those volunteers and their skills and apply them to connecting with those community members for me reimagining is actually taking what we have learned at bendigo food chair and continuing to grow and strengthen it like any change you 're going to go back to where you were and just keep doing what you do there there was always someone or somewhere that needs it my vision for volunteering is that it would become equipment volunteering is community and community is volunteering _"

    "text": "hello everyone and thanks for joining us tonight on uh the city greater benigo presenting an information session on the windfall game stack so firstly i 'll start by introducing myself i 'm going to try and host tonight and then in our web platform and it 's going to be recorded throughout the uh through the entire session as well so before we get into some other introductions i might hand over to uh citygradebenigome councillor andrew metcalf to uh to officially welcome the uh event thanks very much ben i really appreciate being here tonight and i 'd like to acknowledge that the city of greater bendigo is on jar country i 'd like to acknowledge and extend my appreciation to the jaja rung people the traditional owners of the land that we are standing on today today we pay our respects to leaders and elders past present and emerging for they hold the memories the traditions the cultures and the hopes of all georgia wrong people and tangarang because i 'm assuming there 'll be some from tongarang country as well we express our gratitude in the and cultural costs of that sharing and our hope that we may walk forward together in harmony and in the spirit of healing i will say ben um that the idea for this webinar came from the farming and agri-business advisory committee and our rural communities committee so i just want to say thank you to them for coming up with the idea of having a webinar on this topic and i know it is jam packed so i 'm going to leave it there and hand back to you ben thank you and i hope everyone finds the session really informative thanks a lot andrea and yeah as you said it 's um it 's really good to get some feedback from some of these advisory committees that council has on what 's important for um not only residents but businesses and other members of the community so it really did start the the process for us tonight to um to get some experts in the field to talk about this new this new tax and how it is going to affect people um and we 've got a tonight in dennis from afs and associates and also mark from tech legal and before we do this uh [Music] the format tonight is obviously online and going to be recorded and what we 're going to encourage everyone to do is to do question and answer on the bottom of the screen they 'll come through here and at the end of the session we 'll be able to go through and uh answer the questions at the end if anyone does have any uh difficulties with that um you can put up your hand and i 'll be able to access it when we do get to later in the question so before we do that i will firstly um introduce you to mark thanks a lot for that ben um we 've been very happy to be invited to speak here tonight this this new windfall gains tax is a very major piece of law that 's affecting um our primary producers in the city of greater bendigo but also our private property developers as well the tax that uh was thrown uh on everybody 's head since then to get some more detail around what it actually means and um we finally got that uh that detail late last year and and everyone 's starting to make sense of it now so um i 'll just take some time here to share my screen all right so i just have to start obviously being a lawyer i do have to um put a bit of a disclaimer in um tonight just to say that everything that we 're we 're talking about here is obviously provided uh you know a general overview of the topic it 's not meant to substitute for specific legal advice obviously um when you do have your own individual circumstances we highly recommend that you you come and see a lawyer whether that 's us or a regular lawyer that you 're using and also involve your accounts as much as possible and as early as possible okay so i 'll just start with a pretty uh simple overview of what uh the windfall games tax is i 'd assume that everybody here has pardon me has some um idea and but we 'll try and keep it as simple as possible in the limited time that we 've got it is it is a complex tax and there are still some grey areas that we 're waiting for some definition on but we 'll try and give you as much detail as we can tonight so at its simplest uh this is a new tax on um the value of ray 's own land in victoria um it 's it 's quite a high tax it 's uh it 's based on 50 to 62 and a half percent of the value of re-zoned land and it applies to any land that is re-zoned in victoria um so it 's it 's not just uh the the typical greenfield reserve uh residential subdivisions that this would uh apply to uh we 're talking about even small rezonings um in any parts of victoria it applies where there 's an increase in the value of land after rezoning occurs where the value of the land goes above 100 000. so there aren 't too many valuations sorry too many rezonings that so we need to operate on the basis that it will apply to pretty much every rezoning where this tax has been most controversial is that it 's effectively a tax on unrealised capital gains which occur after rezoning um and and most as i said most uh resignings do involve an increase in value and that that increase is immediate when a rezoning does occur so oops sorry i 've come to the end there are some uh rezonings that this tax will not apply to but they are pretty limited i thought i 'd just take you through some of those now rezonings between schedules in the same zone will not [Music] attract the tax so that 's effectively the examples there are a neighborhood residential to a general residential so if you 're staying within the same zone residential commercial industrial the tax won 't automatically be paid or pay a ball what this is trying to achieve is a tax on change in use from things like farming to a residential or an industrial to a commercial there are some limited exemptions for melbourne properties so the the gake or the growth areas interest infrastructure contribution is payable on those properties will not attract wgt rezoning to public land also won 't and there 's also a general catch-all which we 're hoping will be of benefit for the regions in the future for re-zonings which are excluded by declaration of the treasurer i 'll talk a little bit later about how the regions um may be um copying an un or disproportionate um whack of this tax so we 'll see what the treasury has to say in the coming years about types of rezonings which which won 't be affected at the moment we haven 't had any indication about um what those those reasonings will be the key question around who pays this tax the answer is pretty simple it 's the owner of the land at the time the rezoning occurs they 're liable to pay the tax in full so if you 're an individual on title it 's a liability a liability that you 'll incur individually if there are multiple owners on the title it 's a joint and trustee themselves will be liable and land that is held by related companies or trusts are subject to grouping rules so we often see family farms which are owned by multiple farm members and their trusts if those parcels are going to be part of a rezoning they 'll be all grouped together and then all members in the group are jointly and set reliable for the for their proportion of the the tax there 's a simple uh calculation that we need to consider when we 're trying to calculate what the tax outcome actually is the first step is to calculate what 's called the aggregated value uplift so that is the difference between the capital improved value of the rezone property immediately before the rezoning and then after degree zoning so what we refer to there is civ1 and civ2 those valuations are undertaken by or on behalf of the valuer general this is going to be an area of quite a lot of controversy and dispute in the coming years because parties will obviously have an interest or landowners will have an interest in achieving a order to try and minimise their tax liabilities and when the laws were initially announced there wasn 't going to be a mechanism for disputing the valuations valuer general was to obtain fortunately now there is a mechanism but it is limited it 's a period of 60 days after an assessment is issued by the sro after the rezoning and we 'll come to that a little bit further on in the presentation there are the second step there are there are some deductions which are allowable unfortunately they 're not actually known and specified in the in the legislation as it has been passed they will be announced in regulations uh in the future um it 's important to note that this this tax will apply to all rezonings which which occur from 1 july 2023 so we expect to have the the regulations around what will uh be allowable deductions well in advance of them expect that they will be the usual planning costs that uh the landowners or their appointed developers incur when achieving a raise earnings so that 's engaging their town planners their lawyers planning panel hearings or heading into vcat and then the last step is multiplying it by the applicable tax rate so it 's a question of uh working out what the taxable value uplift is after the rezoning and when you 've considered the the cib1 and crv2 valuations the first hundred thousand dollars in uplift won 't be taxable um the next four hundred thousand is taxable at a rate of sixty two and a half percent uh and then after that the uh the fifty percent of the the taxable value uplift uh is uh will uh be used to form the tax rate so as i said it 's quite quite a high tax rate and it becomes payable immediately subject to some deferring rules so the as i just said the wgt is payable at the time of rezoning once the reasoning occurs the sro will be issuing assessment notices to all land holders um who own parcels within the the subject land the owner then has two options and one is to pay the amount in full within 30 days i 'd be surprised if which is available here the owners can defer payment of all or part of their liability by responding back to the sro within the first within 60 days of receiving their notice deferrals are available currently um in metropolitan areas for the growth areas infrastructure contribution if anyone watching is familiar with how gake works it 's a similar model for the wgt but it 's not quite the same the the wjt can be deferred effectively once um not not multiple times as it can be for gake and it can be deferred until the first of the following events so um the words are highlighted here in this slide are words that are quite commonly used in the um duties act so um the first of the events is a dutiable transaction so that 's just more most commonly a sale of the land or a transfer of the land that can be to a third-party purchaser for value or it can be to a family member for value otherwise relevant acquisitions uh are captured so that 's uh sales of shares in um in land holder companies unit trusts uh sales of units if none of those events occur um and 30 years passes after the the the day of the legislation uh the win full gains tax becomes payable in full i 'd expect that uh if there are some uh properties that haven 't been resigned by that point in time that that would be extended out further on the industry the government has responded to industry pressure around giving land owners an ability to actually fund the payment of this tax so um if the land sits there for 30 years um we would expect that there 's some mechanism or that there would be some mechanism in the decades to come when you do defer interest is payable that 's the usual part of the growth areas infrastructure contribution as well it 's quite a low rate of the 10-year bond rate but it will keep accruing until the tax has been paid down in allowing you to defer the sro will hold a first charge over the land so what that effectively means is that they 'll register a notice on the until the windfall gains tax has actually been paid out in full it won 't preclude you necessarily from being able to obtain finance on the land but it will mean that before you transfer the land and sell it out whether you 're transferring to a family member or you 're actually developing and subdividing the wgt which is attributed to that parcel will need to be paid if the land is subdivided the the wgt is apportioned across the lots which are in the subdivision based on area now there are some and this slide relates to the deferral method but there are some dutiable transactions and relevant acquisitions which won 't be um which won 't mean that the deferral ends so you will be able to have what 's called an acquisition and economic entitlement so this is relevant for landowners who might be discussing plans with a developer to come in and develop their land um when a developer does that they generally have to pay duty on the the share of profits that they receive from entering into that agreement that 's called an 'd be getting two hits if the of duty or tax effectively if they were to get duty on the economic entitlement as well as wgt so entering into a development agreement doesn 't trigger the wgt nil consideration transfers so this this is interesting from the point of view of family transfers when land is being gifted um between family members it 's often for no um no monetary value and the law recognises that those transfers shouldn 't trigger the win full game tax in full um but the transferee in that instance must elect to to defer the wgt transfers within deceased estates will be as will be okay as well so if you 've got a parent who who passes the transfer in within the estate to the legal personal representative or the so the executives of the estate won 't trigger the wgt and transfers of land between charities as well some relevant acquisitions which uh which are excluded um so the first one there is an acquisition in a land holder due to a pro rata increase so if there 's a share issue proportion of shares in accordance with their original shareholding um they that one won 't trigger the the tax and then there 's a relevant acquisitions of further interest in companies or trusts so if you are taking a further interest from another shareholder or unit holder land holder duty is already payable on those types of transactions so again the the sro doesn 't double dip and will allow the windfall gains tax to be deferred and sit on the land there are other broad exemptions the first one listed there is it has been of most interest to most landowners and and developers who are dealing with the the new landscape with the wgt so there 's a residential land exemption um for dwellings and two two hectares around um the dwelling which will be excluded from the valuation uh for the civ2 so if there 's a dwelling which is capable of being occupied or for which a building permit has been granted uh then the two hectare exemption will apply uh importantly it doesn 't have to be a principal place of residence so if you dwellings which is quite common you 'll be able to use that exemption multiple times we 're doing we have seen some deals in the last six months where parties are looking to obtain building permits in order to try and minimise the tax i think that 's going to be an interesting area to explore um again the charitable land exemption exists but it 's important to note there that it has to be used or have been used for a charitable purpose for at least 15 years um rezoning errors do occur um historical areas that need to be fixed up um for for an odd uh or an incorrect um zoning outcome that won 't um it won 't trigger the windfall gains tax and then there 's some transitional exemptions as well which have been quite interesting to deal with within our industry in the last 12 months so if you had an option or a contract in place before the laws were originally announced on the 15th of may 2021 and under the contract or the option the the rezoning would happen before the settlement 't be triggered um and and won 't apply which is a really um fantastic outcome if you 're lucky enough to be in that that circumstance if you 've got a long-term contract in place at the moment as well it 's important to note that if you are looking to amend that contract to try and fall within um the exemption for wgt um they 've closed that loophole um in that um the the contract date uh if there 's any any variation after the 15th of may 2021 the new contract date will essentially be treated as the the date for um assessing whether your the exemption applies or not so um that 's a an unfortunate gap that has been closed bree zonings that were underway uh before the 15th of may 2021 as well are exempt if the rezoning happens after 1 july 2023 so in those cases there you will need to demonstrate to the sro that you had a serious rezoning application underway that would involve either engaging with council um employing employing consultants to assist you with the rezoning um or so there are some high evidentiary um burdens to to make there in order to obtain the exemption um so just wrapping up and some key points um it 's these are really onerous laws they 're um in some ways the way they 've been announced is a little bit um has been a little bit difficult to deal with but we are starting to get our heads around them now um the industry 's adapted in the last kind of three or four months to start treating the windfall gains taxes effectively a development cost but it 's important as landowners to know um that there are some some structuring options available to you which um dennis will will talk about in his uh slideshow a little bit later um in order to either remove the wgt or very least minimise it um the exemptions though are pretty minimal and it doesn 't apply just to your typical greenfield developers who are used to government taxes being imposed it 's going to apply to anyone who 's trying to do even a minor rezoning perhaps of a commercial residential subdivision perhaps um it 's it 's uh it 's very broad in application um when you 're involved in the rezoning it 's going to be important to know you 've got very limited options and a very limited time frame to object to any valuations which the value general obtains the sro often does have discretion to consider applications or requests out of time but in this case it 's been made very clear in the legislation that the 60-day time frame to object uh is it there won 't be any ability for any parties to make any uh requests for the the commissioner to exercise their discretion if you 're a landowner and you 're involved in the negotiation of the long-term sale contract or perhaps a development agreement for your land uh where rezoning is contemplated as part of that development um the wgt is going to be an inescapable part of the the negotiations that you have to deal with there we 're seeing in the work that we 're doing for our clients in the last six months there 's been an the terms of development agreements that are being entered into so depending on which party is willing to effectively bear the liability for the windfall gains tax um the the those agreements are being heavily affected by the laws now and the last point that i 've seen in the regions as we are um there is a school of thought at the moment which i tend to agree with around regional properties actually being a little bit disadvantaged um the gake the the gate exemption that is available to melbourne properties uh means that wgt isn 't paid on that land but unfortunately regional properties don 't attract cake uh at the moment and the gate rate is much lower than the tax rate um that the wgt will impose so there 's a real concern there that um affordability in regional areas is going to be um adversely affected so the run that we 're seeing on people to the regions now may um may be affected by the the outcome of the wgt simply because having housing affordability uh will become less in the regions so hopefully 's all for me um for my slides i 'll hand it back to you now um ben and um happy to take questions at the end um if anyone 's got any from the material that we 've talked about thanks a lot mark it was uh very informative and as you did mention we 've had uh we 've got a few questions that have come through in the q a box some might be answered and i reckon dennis might pick up a couple of them as well but please um if you 've got anything that 's front of mind at the moment or something comes up as as dennis goes through i guess from an accountant 's point of view over the next 15 or so minutes put them into the q a box they 'll come through and and the panel can have a look and we can um definitely answer them at the end so um appreciate the work that goes in prior to the meeting today and and i guess your informed info on this market was great so now i might uh talk about um i guess the the accountant side of how this tax will uh will affect and um maybe even some tips on how we can manage it thanks ben uh and thanks to mark i just want to touch on um your last point mark around the impact on regional victoria uh this tax will have impact on on two classes of uh people uh one being the landowner and one being the regional victoria as a whole it is unfairly geared towards taxing regional victoria and as a result we will see the uncertainty around what the land may be revalued at um [Music] possibly push develops to pay premiums for land that 's already resigned in in the classification they 're looking for um and we 'd also expect with the implications of windfall gains tax uh without that tax will be passed on to the purchaser and therefore um house and land packages may become uneconomical um the house prices will go up and land prices will go up so there are broader ramifications as a community and as a regional center and tonight necessarily the impacts on the region but all the impacts on on the land owner and where accountants fit so mark went through uh comprehensively on how the windfall gains tax applies and who it 's uh who it 's relevant to and and what the rates are and when you consider the information mark provided um you might question where the benefit of an accountant uh being in involved is uh it 's critical that as soon as you go down the path of thinking of rezoning or a developer approaches you as a landowner that you engage with your accountants your lawyers and trying to try to determine what is the best outcome to minimise the overall tax there 's very little you can do to minimize the windfall gains tax as mark alluded to so it 's that broader tax picture that we can look at and see what or where we can go from there so tonight i thought what i would go through is just a bit of an example um we have the benefit of working with a number of clients and so i information on on some circumstances and i hope it sort of highlights uh exactly how this might impact the landowner there 's also one of the questions that has come up i 've been watching the q a as we go and i think it 's it 's probably fairly relevant to address right now and it 's the impact of the windfall gains tax on the capital gains tax um outcomes from the salary for property uh so there 's two things that matter here uh the first is is it classified as being on revenue account and so that 's you 're in the business of property development or are you holding the land on capital account now there 's been no correspondence from the ato yet around the deductibility of the windfall gains tax however what we 're expecting is that it will form part of the cost base of the the land and specifically item four uh when you 're trying to work out the cost base of your assets so we will expect any windfall gains tax that is applied to you will actually be overall profit on the sale so i 'm just going to jump in and share the screen and so right now uh just a couple of different scenarios and examples um and the background on this one is uh it 's a farm that 's been in the family for 30 years and it 's 20 acres so i 've been fairly deliberate with some of the information in here just to start to get some consideration around uh items that might be relevant now 30 years puts us outside the capital gains tax um rules so the property will be subject to capital gains uh 20 acres may not seem to be large for a farm but depending on what you 're farming it can be quite viable at 20 acres in this case the owners of the land are approaching retirement and the developer is approached under by the land so at the moment the lands has a market value of 800 000. so i think generally a lot of those conditions there might be applicable to most so in this case we 're going to start with going to do a straight sale of land to the developer or the second is to rezone the land first and and then sell so as i alluded to at the start um we expect that um developers where land will fit within uh growth zones they may be expected to pay premium prices particularly if it is zoned uh with the right classification to begin with uh but in this one uh i 've just said well the land 's worth 800 the developer really wants it so they 've offered 850 000 very simple transaction uh there 's no windfall gains tax because there 's been no rezoning and therefore uh the sellers uh walk away with 850 000 the planning opportunity here is around how the land has been used how long it 's been known for what it 's been used for and for how long uh what was the original purchase price of the land um particularly where a farm has been owned for 15 years and uh the owners apply or qualify for the small business concessions there 's the ability to potentially exempt so your first opportunity to engage with your accountant at this stage is around what is the impact with you and can there be anything done to uh to minimise the overall capital gains tax there are a number of concessions and it 's making sure you 're eligible and able to access the ones that provide the most benefit to you in the second scenario i 've put forward that uh we 're actually going to re-zone the land prior to uh prior to uh selling so the rezoning has generated an uplifting value of 100 that 100 depending on the area uh it could be quite normal um in the examples provided by the state government um they 're talking rezoning increases of up to 400 um quite impractical for i think a lot of our area however not unrealistic so with a 100 uplift in value we 've got a window windfall games tax of 400 000 and i 've already zoning costs of 140 000 there so net proceeds before tax at 1.06 million so if you 're talking to your accountant through this stage you provide the most money in your pocket because typically if we 're retiring we want to do comfortably so just by having the the conversation with your accountant in this scenario you potentially walk away with an extra 200 000 in your pocket on a very simple transaction although rezoning isn 't necessarily a simple uh process uh by using skilled and um expert advisors in that uh it definitely does make it much easier what we 're seeing at the moment is developers actually approaching landowners and asking to enter into a joint venture with them or a partnership for one of a better term and so i 've just explored that to some extent uh down this track as well um in this regard the developer is actually asked to do a development with the owners by way of a joint venture and the developer has said if the land 's worth eight hundred thousand i 'll contribute costs uh of eight hundred thousand as well uh to make us a 50 50 arrangement now under a 50 50 arrangement if we simply took the land value and 's all fairly square and even at that point and if you look at a contract purely based on how much they 're contributing and your current situation it might be quite easy to think okay everything 's fair uh but if we look down we 're converting the land to a total of four million in sale proceeds so two million each uh because the windfall gains tax the land actually hasn 't transferred uh or the windfall games hasn 't been triggered with a developer coming in typically uh it 's a joint venture it 's a separate agreement but the land stays with the current owner so in this case if you were to retain um the land the windfall gains tax would be levied uh completely with you and so your 2 million would be reduced by the 400 thousand in one full gain stacks and your net proceeds before tax uh is 1.6 million and just for comparison i 've put on the the right hand side of the screen uh the impact on the developer and being two million in in sale proceeds let to again engage with your advisors uh is around trying to make sure the deal is structured in such a way that it 's the best outcome for you and i 've just changed it slightly in um including or incorporating the windfall game stacks and there 's a couple of different ways this can be done whether it 's a joint venture or the creation of a new company the opportunity to share that windfall gains tax and make sure it 's a legitimate expense realized by both parties um we can still maintain that 50 50 ownership but we can see that the costs of the landowner are halved uh because windfall gains tax has been shared and so again just in this scenario it 's a two hundred thousand dollar advantage to uh the land holder so what we 're seeing is a really great opportunity to work with developers developers are have been up until this point very keen on exploring the areas around benigo and the way they 're putting together deals and arrangements uh certainly many and varied um there is no one rule 're certainly trying to make sure they maximise their returns and it 's critical that you as lean owners also maximise your own so engaging early with advisors thoroughly recommended and if you can structure the deal in such a way that if we consider that development uh or moving into that development option a real-life example of one we 've been through is uh it was a farming land uh held for an extended period of time within the family what we did was we maintained the value of the property and still being used as farming land up until when it will be rezoned and what that does is it up or increases the cost space of the asset we can sell the land to the new development company at the higher rate which increases the return to the land land owners because they get a greater share but also it means we get a higher portion of tax-free income and then on the back side when the land 's sold we also get a reduced tax there because our cost base is higher so if there 's important to talk to your advisors i would strongly recommend it uh ben that 's it for about me um i 'll throw back to you thanks uh thanks a lot dennis for that um and thanks for the questions that have already come in um we might join get dennis and mark to join us in a bit of a panel to to go through these questions and please um if there 's any more we 've got a couple here to go through but if there 's any more um if you put in the in the q a tab we can definitely have a look and have some answers but um yeah sex does that i think it 's really good i can talk about the way my brain works it 's really good to see some different scenarios rather than some hypotheticals so hopefully that helps some of the attendees so um we have an actual hand of uh of heather so we might start with uh mayor if we can unmute heather and let her uh ask the question we might start with that one you hear me yes i can thank you i couldn 't write it all down because um it was just like getting mashed up in my head i 'm actually um a resident of morong i 'm actually president of the morong community action group and my question is really broad around i understand the developer and i and the land that 's been identified for residential um subdivisions um and i do have concerns as you spoke around the impact that it 's going to have on housing um affordability in our community i 'm also concerned how that will spin off into employment and and that much broader picture but my question at the moment is there is um a lot of development identified for morong one area is the new regional bendigo regional employment precinct and the second is an area that 's identified as um for a for a new school and some ovals and and public spaces that are going to all implement um impact on the city of greater bendigo so my my question is around how is city greater bendigo going to have going to be rezoned in time out this out this way before this tax comes into place how 's that going to impact on city of greater bendigo and and i guess my other add-on is that we are in huge need of infrastructure for a lot of things to go ahead um so we need we for that business employment precinct to go ahead we have to upgrade the water to to marong we certainly need a lot of work around um vehicles moving through murong so there 's a lot of stuff that needs to go on out here who and then all of a sudden all this money is going to state government um what commitment is there back to so i 've really got a layered question here um what commitment is there to help us in some of those areas so that we don 't become a second-rate community and what 's the impact going to be on city greater bendigo with their plans to develop out this way thanks thanks a lot heather um and we might break that into a couple of parts this about the um the treatment of i guess the employment precinct which is now council owned land um and then i guess the the areas earmarked for schools and the rezoning so we might um unpack that and and then um maybe to both mark and dennis if there 's anything around has there been anything about does this new tax go into consolidated revenue or is there commitment to money coming back into infrastructure if there 's anything that um that you may or may not have heard yeah sure um really good questions thanks um heather um so just going back to the point that we discussed any any land that 's going to be used for a public purpose won 't attract this tax so that 's that 's i suppose a key key part of this council won 't be stuck with this liability the question around that that 's around the employment precinct that will depend how that land is actually designed um if it 's to be zoned within a general uh if it 's designed differently to as it is now um be paid but um it is a tax that 's designed um on private development um so depends how um i i don 't um i don 't know how council 's um developing that yeah and i can probably probably give a little bit more information it 's gonna help that 's land that council now owns that that will be rezoned from a farming zone to some form of industrial zone to allow industrial development so that piece of land that will be um i guess the process over the next few years that 's right sure the last question you asked there uh heather is an interesting one um around what actually happens with this this income that the state government will receive at the moment there 's no obligation um to use those funds in any particular way it does go into consolidated revenue it 's something that the the industry is really pushing back on on the government on um to i suppose better utilise the funds that are going to be coming here there is a general school of thought about the way gake degree um the the with targeted policy and precinct structure plans and the like but at the moment this tax doesn 't doesn 't require the government to use the the um the funds in the area from which the the taxes are paid which is a very controversial issue yeah that sounds like a good advocacy piece for uh for not only the security of indigo but i 'd say every every regional council uh around the state about um advocating for hopefully um having some of this money put back into the infrastructure that is needed so and look at something that private developers are really uh interested in as well um if they 're going to be picking up part of the text they they would prefer to see it used in the land that they 're actually developing so we definitely need some some guidance and um clarity there from the state government and are we likely to get that in the short term how long is the piece of string yeah it 's a look it 's a loaded loaded question heather we 've we one way to say it from the government about this tax when it was first announced it was vague in some respect and very wide reaching so i wouldn 't expect necessarily to to get that indication anytime soon we do have quite a long lead in time here as well to one july 2023 um so yeah i wouldn 't um wouldn 't be holding my breath no so um one of the other questions was is that we have a a structure plan or a city council have a structure plan um with the with the planning minister at the moment and it 's being um re re re reworded refined as we need it to um but in the structure plan city of greater bendigo made a bold um bid that in that as such um they would perhaps purchase the land themselves that would become a new school site and then when department or of education decided that we were actually needing a school here that they would then sell that on because they 've already identified a site for um as an education precinct and build something like they 've done at marist in maiden gully where or council became you know became partnership and council put in some playing fields and things so is how how does that impact with council if they were to follow that plan with the um and do that because a lot of a lot of the residents in there are senior people and so they 're in a situation now where they finding it really difficult to move forward because um they they 're getting to a point in their lives where they want to move on but they 've got this structure plan that hasn 't gone ahead yet over their heads and all this other taxes and etc it 's really locked those people into a lifestyle at this moment that they they don 't where they don 't want to be yeah that might just jump you know that 's a it 's a really good question and something that i know council will be working through on this particular instance and particularly for school and public use that i know mark had used earlier of mind and something that um council has a structure plan and we 'll be working on to um to not only progress what we 've got in the structure plan and the employment precinct but also working through i guess the tax um the tax implications on this in the in the particular instance particularly if it 's a council purchasing land to then be um to be given to our school it 's something that we 'll be working through that particular instance on so so do you think it will come under that public purpose land uh i dare say and i 'm happy to be pulled up by dennis or mark but i dare say from a council point of view that 's what we would be pushing for because it would be for a public purchase sorry but on on the individual instance um we would need to go through probably like i said a little bit of um information on the run something we 're definitely working through um through these individual scenarios okay thank you that gives me a little bit of hope other questions here we might jump to so um first one i might ask around we 've got one here around when do you apply for an exemption on the on the rezoning of the sale uh yeah i 'll i 'll take that one so uh you don 't necessarily apply for the exemption um if you get a notice and you think your property is exempt there will be an opportunity within that 60 days after getting the notice to uh to object so it 's uh it 's a question of getting your advice if you do receive a notice um i can 't stress enough that it 's a very short time frame um and the ramifications if you do miss that notice are uh yeah potentially um well they will be quite burdensome so um yeah the the trigger is the rezoning itself um it 's not an exemption that you have to apply for before the rezoning thank you um got one here which i think i know the answer to but we 'll ask is this tax only applicable in victoria yes this yeah there are other states that are looking quite eagerly at this to see how it goes and um looking to introduce things like it themselves um i 've got another one here and a nice little scenario that 's been tossed up on can a family member transfer you who defers for 30 years then transfer the property to another family member within 30 years to defer again so yeah the way it works at the moment the answer is no it 's it 's the first and only of those three events that we went through in the presentation um again a little bit different to the growth areas infrastructure contribution where you can continue to roll over a deferral on transfers that hasn 't quite happened here thank you and uh we 've got another little question here a scenario that 's been put up of a land purchase back in 2020 with a four year settlement agreement as then engage your local council and discuss rezoning later in that year and again in 2021 um asking is that saying that will be exempt from it um you can see the question there i think it 's around the timing um rezoning some farming to commercial land yeah based on those facts there from from josh 's question which i can see here there 's some really good potential for that to be exempt as i said in my presentation it 's going to come down to the evidence that you can present this would involve an application for an exemption to the sro once an assessment has been delivered and so getting as much detail as you can around what you 've done in that period late 2020 early 2021 um will be really important but from what josh is saying there yes starting that discussion around um the resigning with council um hopefully they 've preferably they 've engaged some some outside consultants as well that 's the type of evidence that we need to we would need to demonstrate to the sro but yeah all signs looking good there thanks and i think that 's um and a couple of these questions to me are probably really highlighting dennis 's point of if you early as possible make sure you 've got your advisors there that are going to be up to speed with things um and that 's going to really help in these scenarios and having the time stamps by the sounds of it so it 's probably really i would i my opinion for from what i 'm hearing in the last hour or so and from what everyone else is if you 're not sure go to your advisor and ask a question because uh it could be a very very good spend of a little bit of money to make sure that you 've got the right answers so another one this is probably got a few different scenarios here and it 's probably uh probably yourself again mark around um how much notice do you get around the land being re-zoning i guess there 's lots of potential scenarios there um yeah there are a lot um probably an important point here is that you you can be dragged into a rezone you don 't necessarily have to initiate it yourself um typically you 'll you 'll get tend to spring on people but yeah it 's a hard one to answer because every scenario is so different you won 't get a notice about the windfall gains tax being payable though until the rezoning itself has been completed so um rezonings aren 't fast processors even the simplest ones you you 're talking you know realistically 18 months so large ones where the psp is involved you give a number of years in the making there so um it would be hard to imagine a scenario where a rezoning would be a surprise yeah it 's sort of it 's not going to happen overnight and as you said a lot of them um not saying it doesn 't happen um without the owners sort of being informed but he said it 's not sort of thing you gotta wake up tomorrow and say we 've been being rezoned and you 've got a big tax bill in the in the mail it does take uh it does take a lot of time so that 's right um and we 've got one last question there around like you 're dominating the questions on this mark so that 's okay so uh the question is uh if council 's marked area is a growth area and a proposed general residential zone although you are zoned farming and developers are visiting but with long contracts how much noise do you get of your properties very zone we were just they 're probably really covered that but how quickly can this happen so um yeah the again depending on the scenarios most developers who are talking to um particularly farmers know that they 're in for quite a long process um here there 's example around the wrong that 's obviously a hot spot full development at the moment that 's that 's going to be a year 's long process there um so there is a very very small opportunity for some uh owners or developers to try and achieve their rezoning before the laws kick in in one july 2023 um unfortunately with the way um most most uh rezonings get caught up in the system um and particularly since these laws have been announced how many wouldn 't hang my hat on trying to get uh get that get a resulting done by the middle of next year to beat the tax yeah it 's definitely um i can speak on behalf of bendigo there 's definitely a a backlog there of um of rezonings and plantings but i know it 's a pretty statewide process with a lot happening working through things so um unfortunately uh it 's not something you can you can turn around overnight that 's right um really good question here around um the region 's seemingly being disadvantaged and is there any mechanism for lobbying state government to move to an all playing field to an or even playing field um really good question that i know it 's something that councils are doing i know it 's something that developers will definitely be doing um but uh once again we 're open to the panel but one of us would be the more we can speak to the local members about it and individual instances you mentioned mark i guess the the fleet of the regions is great uh but to do that we need land available and we need land that 's affordable to be able to do it so i am definitely i know it 's something the councils will be doing and developers would be um the individual um done the right way individual proposals about where it is and what 's um holding up development i 'd say definitely doesn 't hurt in that scenario is there anything mark or dennis from your and i know most likely um the reiv and others will definitely be um would be lobbying but uh yeah look i i think mark will probably be able to provide a little bit more detail but i think your spot on ben i think loving local members when the state government first announced his tax it was really about trying to level the playing field was how they described it and sharing some of the um uplifting value with uh organizations or community groups around building skill schools infrastructure and other items like that so the best thing that can happen is that people make noise sir to council but more will be talking uh long and loud about it but we need to make sure particularly with benigo being a labor area at the moment um for me it would seem more as a direct line to have those conversations assuming victoria remains a labor um state after the next state election so just make sure you 're asking the questions make sure you you 're harassing your local members yeah it 's a that 's a really good point dennis makes there about uh yeah having insight and availability to to labor members the the private property development industry the peak body the urban development institute has done a lot of lobbying around this tax um and also the the social housing tax that was proposed in the last couple of weeks they 've been a la a loud voice in this front they 've they 've been lucky to get a few small wins i think in this winfor games tax legislation but in terms of the regions they they do have a very uh metropolitan focus um we would love to see um yeah we 'd love us um and i dare say we 'll see councils um lobbying quite hard there is that discretion for the treasurer as a as i pointed out that is a catch-all there um when they drafted this legislation they knew that there 's a lead in time and there may be some modelling that needs to be considered before we see what the effects are in the region so hopefully we 'll see some action there in the next in the next year thank you very much and i want to say looking at the time and we decided i want to say um huge thanks to dennis and mark for tonight and um and for everyone to to log in and ask some really valid questions on on what is a a pretty complex new year um new change uh in this space that 's also come across pretty quickly you know in the scheme of uh what we would normally take on things that take a long time so mean um i want to say a huge thank you for for bringing your expertise and taking the time as it has been recorded tonight and will be available for uh for anyone to view or if you 've got other people you think they 'd be um that would get some benefit to have a look on the city of greater bendigo website but um i want to say thanks to everyone for joining tonight um thanks councillor metcalf for the introduction earlier and and the farming and advisory committee to to raise this idea and it 's something i can say as an economic development area of council we really want to try and make it um help get the intro out to businesses and businesses and community to make sure we can make educated decisions so if you took nothing out of tonight other than i 'm going to go and call my accountant i 'm going to call my lawyer because i 'm not quite sure well then i think we 've got something together tonight um so thanks a lot tonight and i want to say a special thank you to sally beer and the team who 's uh who 's done all the that and and i hope everyone has a great night and got some benefit out of the session thank you you _"

bell pepper bridge I have someone to move Thank You Council of five and seconded councillor Metcalf all those in favor against carried I now move to suspension of Standing Orders I 'm someone to move Thank You Council flag second and counselor Iman all those in favor against carried as we have done always in this term of council we come to our community recognition section and I would like to read a message out to our community we live in interesting times as someone said to me today it 's very uncharted waters that we are in and I would like to thank our residents for their cooperation and understanding as you can appreciate the advice around kovat 19 coronavirus is changing constantly a new advice is being received only from state and federal leaders and health officials Council is doing its best to respond to this advice which is why our seats are further apart tonight around the council table to help limit the spread of the disease we are also live-streaming tonight 's council meeting via the city 's Facebook page so you can see and hear us while we also continue to broadcast by our phoenix FM over the radio and online in response to the victorian government declaring a month-long state of emergency the City of Greater Bendigo has closed facilities run by its Bendigo venues and events unit this includes the capital and alum borough theatres doubly housed the engine-room the town hall aside from holding the council meetings libraries have also closed from today but our Visitor Information Centre Bendigo art gallery and polls remain open for the time being but this could change very easily you may have noticed the presence of security tonight this is to helping pause social distancing and to convey information to residents that our preference is for you to watch or listen from home in regards to April 's council meeting and how it will be run we will continue to monitor advice provided by state and federal and health officials and hold future meetings in line with this regards to what council is doing to help our community during this time I was kind of a meeting today with business health and community leaders to discuss how we are responding as a community to coronavirus we are hoping to make weekly and we 'll share various information relating to how residents can manage their own health and well-being ensuring that they are also communicating the best ways to support business and how businesses can access the financial support they need while also ensuring we look after our more vulnerable residents onto other news we were very excited to win the gold at the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards in the destination marketing category for our promotion of the Tudors wins this campaign the win campaign attracted 75,000 people to Bendigo which was the result of a collaboration across the tourism industry and with Bendigo art gallery highlights of the campaign included a royal pop-up tram at the Piazza in Rosslyn Park the Royal train from castle main to Bendigo a giant Western instant lego display at the Bendigo Visitors Centre the royal street art and royal accommodation packages so like to acknowledge the finalists in the Bendigo District Cricket Association and EMU Valley cricket leagues and congratulate all teams that made it to that point I believe Emma Creek is deciding tonight about the future its competition and it is a real shame that we 're now seeing grassroots sport cancelled although we can all understand why I would also like to acknowledge that Bendigo was rated very highly in the top three out of a RMIT study on livable regional cities across Australia I think there were 21 regional cities and we were rated in that that top three so we all know why our city is most livable and it means something to each and every one of us in a different why so that was really good news as well I think we can all look forward to the time when it can 't becomes business as usual for our community but in the meantime what we ask is that you stay safe ensure your personal hygiene regime of washing hands is regular be kind to each other at the supermarket and make good informed decisions I 'll close the community section of the meeting will now move to public question time council allow up to 30 minutes of public question time for questions on any matter except for planning others that are on the agenda tonight those who have a question are asked to come to forward to the right barrier state their name and address and direct the question to the mayor I also invite those in the auditorium downstairs who wish to ask the question to make their way upstairs now we have removed the microphone and lectern toward any risks of contamination so please be clearly in a loud voice the mayor will repeat your question into the microphone for the benefit of viewers and listeners a reminder that there is to be no preamble introduction or comments so please just ask one question we 'll start with a number of questions that we received during the week thank you thanks very much Jess and we did receive a number of questions that came in up until 3 o 'clock this afternoon there was some couple of later questions that came in to those people as well in the next day or two so I 'll begin with those and then when we finish depending on the time we 'll work through any others that want to ask from the floor so I 'll just go through the first one is from Karen and Karen Flynn in Howard Street Epson the question is did the council take into consideration the apos separation guidelines when approving the development of OKC a park estate most especially as some of these blocks are less than 100 meters from the treatment plant boundary to Karen and Karen if they 're listening answering the question will require some considerable research into the planning history of the land and what guidelines apply the time of the subdivision given the planning permit was issued in 1995-96 API guideline 15 18 with recommendation separation distances for industrial residual air emissions was released in 2013 so it was well after the estate was actually established given the research time involved city officers will provide a written response to this question the next one I have here is from Ellen Howard a for little didn 't Terrace office the question is I understand the value of general of Victoria will provide a valuation on the land only aspect at the city 's main builds and terraced site as I believe this is likely to be considered by council by a report on the sale of land by May 2020 I and I expect a good many other ratepayers and citizens want to know whether and if not will the city undertake commissioning a second independent commercial valuation ensuring that is done by a value up with established knowledge and experience of Bendigo to ensure ratepayers get the best value for their prime CVD site at little interest Ellen in response to your question in the report on councils involvement in the vinegar gov hub project that was presented in February 2000 19 council meeting it was outlined that the value of General Victoria would oversee the valuation process for the council on site in Littleton Terrace at Bendigo as part of this prescribed process the value of general obtains two separate valuations in addition and to further protect the interests of the valuation information will all be used by the value of general the Victoria to determine the value of the land third question tonight is on github and it comes from Karen Hughes in Bullock Street given the fact that no decision has been reached by Council on the sale of the ratepayer land with a proposed github project can counsel advised if their premature actions have breached any legislation or legal responsibilities or governance appliance Carolyn at the February 2018 council meeting council resolved to become a tenant in the Bendigo gulp hub project and provided in principle approval to sell the little done Terrace site to enable the development to proceed this was and continues to be a clear signal to the community organisation and Victorian Government of counsels intention to be part of the Bendigo gump home in preparation for the project the organisation has taken a number of steps including relocating the customer service center to our Hopeton Street office and relocating a number of staff remote Littleton Terrace offices to office accommodation in Fountain Court that is least on a temporary basis I presume these are of these constitute a breach of legislation or legal requirement nor is Council of aware of other breaches is pump implementing the council decision Council also provided in principle approval to sell the Littleton Terrace site to enable the development to proceed in the council report council committed to sell the land in accordance with the obligations as set out in the Local Government Act 1989 council remains committed to this the lease at that and Court has an exit clause which will enable the council to relocate to its previous office should the project not proceed the feedback from staff within the organisation on the move has been extremely positive next question is about Gulf hub in March twenty twenty eighty three percent of over 600 people surveyed in the Bendigo monthly newspaper poll said that it would be a waste of assets if our existing council buildings were demolished in order to build a new gum home could the city please advise when they will consult and ask their residence if they want the CBD Littleton terrorist council site sold and the main council offices demolished if not on the side of our council assets please provide the dates times and events help to inform engage and most importantly engage residents views on the side of our council assets lindsay sergeant Huntley lindsay the city has consulted with residents on a number of occassions beginning in 2013 with the independent review where recommendation 11 recommended the city applicaiton plan for consolidating its offices as a high priority to enable a high performance culture increased organizational efficiencies and improve the customer experience the community was extensively consulted during the independent review process and the council adopted in principle all 69 recommendations the city interviewed 120 people and reviewed 129 submissions in 2018 the city consulted with professional consultants to perform a full analysis of options on the 27th of july 2019 a community design consultation day was coordinated by development Victoria and Holcomb bending in the Bendigo Town Hall inviting the community to attend and provide feedback to the proposed gap hub in addition there have been consultants with several community business and other stakeholder groups about the project gov hub and councils audit and Risk Committee counsels councillors Lindsay and this includes receiving and responding to 23 of your letters the articles in the Bendigo monthly about the Bendigo gap hub are paid Abbot Orioles Council has not been offered the opportunity providing broad effects to these articles I would also state that the survey is not a validated survey there is strong community support for the Bendigo github project and the other exciting developments in the northern end of the city precinct the next question is actually from Julie and Julie and Joe and whilst that yourself were you happy for me thank you yeah [Music] [Music] thanks very much Julian for your question and council has considered all aspects of collocation with state government and have also engaged the independent expert advice of consultants of PwC on this there has been no issues of conflict or integrity concerns raised there are many benefits for our community and organization of co-locating with key staff from the Victorian state government certainly Council would be on one floor and not mixed with in the other floors in that building they will certainly have meetings together where appropriate on mutual convenient for our community the enhanced services for our customers and improved efficiencies for our organization the revitalization of the city centre and the additional jobs for our economy as we know have all been considered in this PwC value the productivity increases from this project at 16 point 1 million and also assess the project would inject 131 million into the local economy a large proportion of this will be through construction jobs our local firms and tradespeople will be well-placed to obtain work from these contracts and we will continue to work with our local businesses and with the state government to advocate the local content in this and other projects council offices participated in a contractor forum in July last year showcasing the pipeline of upcoming projects including the Bendigo Golf hub there was strong interest in this with over 200 contractors in attendance and represented there was strong interest last year there is now the vital importance that these projects continue the combined total of around 500 men of the investments will underpin the building of confidence in our local community particularly after what we 're we support our businesses to recover from the current economic challenges associated with Cove at 19 thanks Julian our next question on the proposed gap up comes from Allan Stevens at no Eaglehawk one-stop shop could the city please clearly indicate and measure in dollar terms the expected benefits to accrue to ratepayers and the city of Greater Bendigo employees of a so-called one-stop shop to the proposed github and does this mean some staff will no longer be required due to the efficiencies gained not thanks Ellen for your question and there are many benefits for our community our economy and our customers of the Bendigo gov hub project many of which have been quantified by the independent consultants PwC which I 've mentioned earlier that provided advice to Council in addition to the important uplifting economic activity for them to go the Bendigo Cove hub will deliver enhanced levels of accessibility service and fast outcomes for our customers opening up offices currently leased by Council to other businesses and agencies improved quality workplace to increase the attraction and retention of staff productivity increases forecast at 16.1 million an years of in substandard accommodation and the Bendigo Golf hub will enable the city to be even more efficient and customer focused in the way we deliver our services and our community I think I 'd also like to add there in terms of the the outputs of from electricity and certainly infrastructure costs we know that the building will be built to around about the 2019 building related regulations that have just been released last year which again brings it to actually the highest standard building that will be in Bendigo number seven is a suspension of major decisions and this comes from Peter the cynic in Kennedy Street Bendigo as a state of emergency has now been declared in Victoria to combat covert 19 and with the possibility of further rescue being imposed will counsel leave and exercise governance for the community ratepayers and all residents by suspending any decisions that relate to the sale of land for the government hub until such time as this health crisis has passed where residents and ratepayers can again have the opportunity to meet this community to formulate and respond to for your question council is continuing to review its operations and decision making while we prepare for and respond to cope at 19 we are identifying key positions key functions and key projects and we 'll continue to do this and again I 'll reiterate this project will be especially important as we support our businesses to recover from the current economic challenges associated with code 19 we now move on to another question and this is regarding the golden square pool and I will add that this is actually on the agenda tonight however I will read the question and answer but you must bear in mind that it will be obviously debated later in there in the agenda at three point to this there is three questions that are very similar I 'll read each three and then I 'll give a response the first one is from Erin Bentley if the lease of the pool is extended what funding will be available for the broader Golden Square sporting and user groups to keep up with other clubs in the region and cater for women 's sport the the pool have with the participation of sport in the golden square community and another question from Adele trot what impacts will this decision have on the participation of sport in the golden square community as it currently stands the club are already struggling with numbers recruitment of players due to the facilities that are currently there and lack of space thanks Erin Matt and Adele for your questions the number and value of requests for funding significantly outweigh the available budget each year across all categories of expenditure from bridges to sporting facilities our adopter community plan includes the strategic priority of well-being and fairness which is utilized to determine the merits of projects to be included in the annual budget golden square recreation and all tenant club projects will be considered alongside all other requests regardless of the decision council makes tonight it is clear that there will be disappointment from a group within the community who are unable to grow the next question comes which is a Golden Square sporting precinct and the question comes from squat trollop in spring garlic wanna hit with spring go Leroy extremely dangerous and outdated cricket training facilities at Golden Square thanks Scott for your question and the city has been progressively renewing and upgrading cricket facilities in Greater Bendigo over recent years and golden Square are one of the high priorities for the upgrade unfortunately the current facility is relatively small and utilizes a run from the oval which creates maintenance issues ideally when upgraded this facility would be enlarged to cater for the participant growth and relocated off the oval area the master plan process has identified the difficulty in achieving this within the small reserve without impacting on another user and again demonstrates that regardless of council 's decision a user group will be never negatively impacted a next question is Golden Square sporting facilities and the question comes from Ian Calot can counsel please explain why one community facility the golden square pool which has limited season and a duplicated service set to other closeby council facilities should have an extension of four years to arrangements my particular concern is female participants in football netball and cricket are involved are provided extremely substandard provision and facilities with why are you holding back female participation in sport thanks Ian for your question the proposal to expand expand extend sorry by four years is pragmatic council is considering multiple and master plan options for the reserve with each having an impact on multiple user groups it is intended that four years is a reasonable amount of time to a complete the master plan with broader community consultation be undertake design and approval processors and seasick funding support it is anticipated that work could commence to implement the outcome at the end of the four year period in response to council holding back from female participation in sport it is necessary to point out that Council has invested significantly in female friendly facilities during this term and the previous term of Council in approximately the last eight years there 's been additional change rooms at the Strela Park for female umpires the dick Conroy pavilion new netball change rooms at the Canterbury Park dedicated adjacent to the courts new change rooms at the epsom Huntley recreation reserve 18 total change rooms within the stadium at the eager Hawk soccer club Park in preparation for the construction of two nipple courts beside this nearing completion umpires change rooms at Golden Square to mourn female change rooms at spring gallery soccer club Stanley Avenue Bendigo stadium expansion which includes change rooms for external network courts Morris College which includes netball and umpire change rooms umpire change rooms at Canterbury Park change rooms and pavilion at garden gully to cater for hockey in the region change rooms at the qeo netball courts upgraded change rooms at the QIO to be family friendly family female friendly change rooms and umpire room at Deer Park Kangaroo Flat and extensions and alterations to female friendly rooms at the barrack reserve in Heathkit current projects the design of a Pahlavi and Harry trot recreation reserve which will include netball and umpire change rooms design of change room upgrades at club courts travel to a derby female-friendly upgrades to Huntley change rooms to be female friendly and more so I think as you can see from that Ian there 's been a substantial amount of money that 's been expended on female sport and sport more broadly another Sam cane the president of the golden square pool link and Sam you 'll hear tonight would you like to ask that question thanks very much Sam for your questions I 'll read that question again does the city of Greater Bendigo still have confidence in the golden square pool links management ability and why hasn 't the city ever raised or detailed to me as in Sam as the president of the golden square pool league suppose management concerns despite seven years of successful community operation and lease renewals from the city Sam council does have the confidence that the golden square pool link are able to manage the swimming pool and the intention of the proposing council undertake maintenance at the site is to reduce the workload volunteers and to ensure legislated essential safety measures are met next question is the Bendigo swimming pools golden square pool and it comes from Andrew Penner why is it taking so long for the completion of the new aquatic strategy Andrews here thanks Andrew did you want to come forward I 'm sorry I 've reached a question out have you person and your question is why is it taking so long for the completion of the new Aquatic Center strategy thank you yep good on you so I 'm happy Craig if you want to take it but on the aquatic strategy has progressed not as quickly as we would have liked but as you would well appreciate there are 13 sites to be considered it was 2010 when it was last done each with their own complexities and very significant building and operational cost implications and that certainly has changed even in the ten years since that was first written council has progressed the options for the Golden Square Recreation Reserve and is considering Golden Square swimming pool tonight this work has contributed towards development of a draft strategy which is expected to be considered as a draft by Council in the coming months thanks Andrew Ken Hamilton all right so ken has a question and is from Shelburne can counsel please advise how they are legally entitled to carry out fire damage to the golden square pool when under the lease golden square pool is responsible for all themselves using those local trades people in volunteer labor thanks Ken for your question this land is vested in counsel from the crown of the building damaged is owned by the greater city of Bendigo insurer who ensure the asset the city has the right one to take these repairs which if undertaken will not only repair the building but will modernize it to meet modern building requirements next question is about the golden square pool and it comes from Paul Abbott in Pioneer Drive maghen going if the pool remains open how will the council assist the football the netball clubs to cater for the increase in female participation there has been initial meetings to begin a master plan for Wade Street precinct and if the pool remains open this will further inhibit growth in female sport for the golden square community as it stands at the moment the female facilities at Wade Street are unacceptable thanks Paul for your question if the pool continues for a further four years as proposed in the recommendation council will utilize this time to finalize the master plan with the broader community it is obvious that regardless of council 's decision tonight there will be a user group who are negatively impacted Barbara Lomas on I saw Barbara downstairs but she may not have come in so Barbara from Golden Square it is proposed in this evenings recommendation for the golden square pool link to have an automatic closure clause that costs over 20,000 to other local swimming pools who have the city of Greater Bendigo responsible that in sorry do other local swimming pools who have the city of Greater Bendigo responsible for the asset maintenance had this clause and if not why is golden square pool being singled out so Bob old Square swimming pool is the only facility with this cause this Clause does not order medically close the pool but rather it reflects that investment in a single repaired replacement above this value is a significant investment for consideration by Council another question here from golden squid walnuts from Scott Wilkinson Scott 's son from thistle street with the covert 19 concerns being more pressing than any other and given some agenda points for tonight 's meeting have without notice so Scott 's obviously referring to the golden square pool agenda item would it be prudent for council to ship the decision about the future of the golden square swimming pool to a later date which would also allow a consultation to be sought from all relevant users thanks Scott for your question consultation throughout the master plan process has made it clear that regardless of the decision that council makes there will be a user group who will be disappointed while previous council resolutions proposed a response in April this report has been developed and is available for a decision earlier and I do know that the group 's met up until May last year and I think there was communication in August last year saying that the master plan couldn 't go ahead until council actually made a decision Gong Square master plan the question from bud pair oh right Taylor Street asked one it is the feeling of all user groups that an amicable consensus can be reached between user groups about how the land surrounding the golden square pool can best be used as not convened a meeting with all user groups to discuss this since May 2009 Brad as I had just 19 sorry as I just mentioned there has been a final meeting in May 2009 but user groups were notified in August I think that there was no further activities and then there was a recent meeting at the beginning of March another question from Julie Dillon golden square pool hard-working volunteers from a range of clubs and news groups football and netball cricket bowls croquet and the Paul have been looking forward to a decision be delivered regarding the future use of the area this plan was to be delivered in April 2020 can counsel honor this initial pledge and hold this agenda appoint over until the April meeting of council and conduct the promised collaboration from all user groups thanks julie for your question while this was previously to be considering in April during consultation with other user groups it became clear that the master plan as I said could not accommodate all the existing user groups on the small site and the decision regarding the golden square pool the written questions that I have and we have about four minutes so I would ask we can extend for about ten minutes if anyone else has a question that they would like to ask or certainly don 't want to to stop that opportunity thank you if you come forward and just say your name thank you I 'll get you to speak up Mac said that I 'll be able to repay provide thanks very much max so for listeners tuning in on Phoenix and also streaming Max 's question was he was asking how counsel can make a decision regarding the golden square pool when he feels that all stakeholders haven 't_''_2051.179 been giving given that consultation through that process I 'm sorry president the golden squiggle of did I capture that Alright for you mix yeah so max I think you would also agree that 's probably been responses that I 've read out there there has been as I said the master planning work that 's happened with groups with various scenarios for that site in Golden Square it has come to a point where as I said the last meeting was made 2019 there was communication around August 2019 to say that it really was awaiting Council 's decision there still is more work to be done and the information there is felt that as the recommendation said tonight and will be debated that there was an extension as the recommendation so that work would be done in consultation with the community thanks max no thank you thanks very much max any other questions as I said the Golden Square pool is on item 3.2 on the agenda and I 'm sure councils will discuss that in more detail move results of Star Wars Thank You Council fire to resume standing orders and council flex second and all those in favor against to carry we now move to Council Holden who 's doing her report this evening because council REM sees some not present so I 'll hand to counsel Alden thank you thank you Mary Rock this may be the last time for a while that counselors can rattle off a long list of community events that we 've attended of course this these monthly counselor reflections it always highlights the huge range of activities that occur in our community some of which were able to support and participating in but in the near future we 'll need to look at other ways to support groups online and via other technologies have been one way so in the past month there 's been a few openings that I have attended one being the opening of the overview exhibition at Dudley house along with councillors five from the pet the bridge this space continues to be a great support to emerging and local artists another launch was the exhibition launch of the Bendigo post office gallery for the history of the Bendigo Easter Fair how lucky are we to be able to see up-close artifacts of our history and shared experiences and past the hundred and fifty of these two fair celebration may have been deferred but uncertain that next year 's event will now be even bigger than was planned for this year there was the 1.6 billion ways to be Muslim photographic exhibition launched at the Bendigo Goldfields library it was a Bendigo Islamic Association has support from the city of Multan City and multicultural Arts Victoria credit to mr. Ferraro be a member of the Bendigo Islamic Association and counsels community harmony project officer Phillip Walker it aims to support positive storytelling and community engagement in the lead-up to the construction of the mosque and the Muslim community center in Bendigo while the planned school events may be uncertain it will ultimately allow our community to reflect on our commitment to diversity and inclusion artist Peter door was also spoke powerfully buddies Ozzy poster project and his reflections are covered in his book poster boy which I think we may all have more time to read there were several events this month I spoke at the boomerang bags final final celebration after four thousand five thousand four hundred bags were made in Bendigo while the initial project is paused there 's a legacy that 's assisted us to better replace plastic and to contribute to keeping waste from landfill in Bendigo there 's an estimate of some tens of thousands of single use bags being kept from landfill plus over a congratulations goes to Leanne and Loretta and the many volunteers involved in the past couple of years for all their efforts I launched the draught gender equity strategy at Women 's Health Loddon Mallee International Women 's Day breakfast this strategy provides a shared vision to enhance gender equity in our community by providing a framework by outlining structural relational and attitudinal changes aimed at fairness and equal opportunity for all the Zonta International Women 's Day dinner had a terrific speaker dr. Ellie Chapman she spoke about stem science technology engineering and maths and women in technology and design congratulations also go to Nicole ferry for our editor of the Bendigo Advertiser for being named the 2020 woman of achievement by Bendigo Zonta on the evening for her championing of gender equity Latrobe o week is always a good event and there are many enthusiastic new students at Latrobe were again welcomed this year and we wish them well in their studies it may be delivered in a non-traditional manner for some time but I 'm sure they will all progress satisfactorily there was the Youth Council elections for and Billy Taylor and we wish you great success in the coming year the AFL W Richmond and Geelong match that we spoke about that this last meeting was a terrific great day it saw a crowd of over five thousand people and it was fortunate that it was scheduled when it was and people poured in towards Jalan proved to be too good for Richmond on the day I look forward to more of these matches in Bendigo in the future and it 'll certainly act to some inspiration for a young women to kick a footy and then also the visit to the lost trade sphere was such a fantastic day out how fortunate are we in Bendigo with crowds of over 20,000 and again the timing was very fortunate it 's poised to be a future success even further than it was then some highlights for me included the most beautiful puppet from the sculptor with sculptor Boone Smith as the also beautiful porcelain sauerkraut fermenting crocks cheese making stalks and an amazing astronomy cabinet with its rare inlaid woods and an internal solar system made by was the weaving demonstration by gun one her women from Arnhem Land what a privilege it was to observe their craft including creation of Bush dies for the pandanus strips used for weaving their special products we certainly are very very lucky to be able to host this wonderful event and certainly I 'm looking forward to it in 2021 so as we look to the future for many it 's an anxious time indeed with the kovat 19 pandemic the world is changing rapidly around us the nations on a warlike footing and with that comes innovation and resourcefulness it 's a challenge but hopes will provide opportunities to do things like reading and reflecting participating in our online community activities and the thing that I 'm looking forward to most is getting out into the garden with more time to grow veggies social distancing and good hand hygiene in general is certainly the best option for us despite the inconvenience it creates so I hope the community on big in Bendigo stays well and we will emerge to further what we love about our home in the future report I think I did some coffee it 's about that jalan richmond game I must um called call good on those thank you now we 're now keep moving through the agenda and declarations of conflict of interest and I have something that I would like to raise in relation to item 3.2 Catherine McAuley so sorry I was saying that gods group pool being 3.2 3.3 that is about 3.2 Catherine McAuley college I declared no direct or indirect conflict of interests that would prevent me from participating in the debate or boating I am however mindful that some might perceive or believe I have a personal interest in this manner and that this will predetermine the issue in my mind independent of the debate and not because of it let me assure you that as a swan counselor my duty is to the community as a whole and I will put aside all personal interests and bias and determine the matter with responsible objectivity and I just wanted to say that I have two daughters that go to CMC in year 9 and year 12 so with flake to move and counsel a 5-2 second all those in favor against carried we have no petitions and joint letters that have been received so we 'll now move to item mark two in the agenda and that is the planning scheme amendment c2 three to four Strathfield say urban design framework adoption of amendment following a panel hearing and there 's been a recommendation that 's been put forward by the offices do I have someone to move Thank You councillor Metcalf someone to second council five council makeup Thank You Mara rule the recommendation before us is that council accept the late submissions and request the Minister for planning to appoint an independent to consider the outstanding submissions this is the next stage in the process to apply a development contribution plan no valachia the Huntley area this plan seeks to apply a coordinated approach to the collection of levies to be used for infrastructure related to roads internet intersections and shared parts six submissions were received including to late submissions of these two of these two were from affected land holders and four from authorities some 's appropriate when there is an agreement between submitters and the council that a panel be appointed to hear from each submitter and I support this recommendation Thank You councillor Metcalfe councillor five thank you man Thank You council met but then these planning processes the plainest him amendments it 's all like that do take a long time they do involve a lot of community consultation as councilman kafirs alluded to and certainly there are times when we have people who don 't agree with what is going on and it is appropriate that it 's heard by and independent panel I too would support this because once we 've got the independent panel then we can accept or reject that as well but more importantly it gives everybody a fair chance before an independent umpire so always supports the recommendation thanks counselor five other councillors it would like to speak nope summing up council makeup I 'll put the motion all those in favor against Carrie now move to item 2.2 which is the planning scheme amendment c-23 to stress a urban design framework adoption of amendment following council hawk and second accounts on that car for council I think you I 'd like to remove the recommendation that the council accept the panel 's recommendation number one sorry accept the panel 's recommendation number two a dr. Mann meant see to three to two greater bendigo planning scheme with changes as recommended by the panel and to make a minor further change to the proposed general residential zone on part of 528 cannery lane to align with further work completed since exhibition of the amendment and then number three for the adopted amendment to the minister for point of for planning for approval together with the prescribed information pursuant to section 31 one of the Planning and Environment Act 1997 so as mentioned in the report there are about eight steps in this plan scan amendment process and what we 're up to now is some with this recommendation is step seven so the whole process began I think back in October 2016 so there 's been an enormous amount of time and effort taken to get to where we are today extensive community consultation and communication reviewed a panel hearing held and further amendments then made I stay within the report this amendment has solid reasoning to back it up and brings together a number of pieces of previous work that are already being undertaken for strike field so it introduces the first local area plan into the greater bendigo planning scheme so we 'll make the planning scheme more usable and robust for the community the developers the city the direction taken has been supported by the independent planning panel so I recommend that council adopt the amendment with the proposed changes and forward it to the Minister for planning to approve and in doing so this will complete the amendment process thank you thanks councillor honk councillor Metcalfe Thank You mera rule it 's a long road sometimes before you get to an outcome especially with local government this urban design framework for the Strathfield say town center was first released to the public on the 12th of October 2016 which was the final reading of the previous council it 's taken until now to work through all the phases of the planning scheme be sent to the Planning Minister for approval in this settled there is a very detailed list of what the amendment covers in the report and I won 't reiterate these but they will become evident in future planning applications that are received for this area I 'm sure the planners will be breathing a sigh of relief that this amendment is about to be finalised and included in the payment scheme thank you thanks Council make up other councils councillor Oldham Thank You Mary look oh yes as councillor walk has said this is the first local area plan for our planning scheme and it 's a significant achievement with the implementation of the Strathfield say urban design framework and the Strathfield say Township plank there was some concern expressed by some residents about the need for greater certainty regarding some aspects of vegetation management in such a rapidly growing township and the proposed amendment strengthens local policy around the retention and establishment of native vegetation and with the ambition to increase tree cover across Greater Bendigo event the new greening Greater Bendigo strategy will also provide further opportunities a separate amendment process but we look forward to the opportunities to protect and enhance the stress field so environment for our changes such as these we 've seen today 's newspapers opinion piece that as rapidly growing city we 're on the cusp of getting things wrong when it comes to urban planning and design the costs of sprawling community and the necessary infrastructure provision is front of mind for or contemporary planners this amendment will allow for good design outcomes and allow for neighborhoods and small towns where people can readily access their daily needs and where there 's real transport choice rather than rely on cars so I support and accept the panel 's recommendation and and adoption of the amendment Thank You councillor Oldham other councillors that would like to speak councillor Hawke in summing up thank you with that I 'll put the motion all those in favor against curry item 2.3 313 Navy a street vendor go to lot subdivision of land demolition of existing dwelling and the development of two dwellings and there 's a recommendation the officers are put forward Thank You you Mary rule the recommendation is that a sewer to section 61 of the plain in environment of 1987 council issue a notice of decision to refuse a grant to grant a permit for two lot subdivision of land demolition of existing dwelling and development of two dwellings at 39 district builder 3 level 5 0 on the following grounds 1 the development will adversely impact significance and appearance of the Heritage Place contrary to clauses 15 point O 3 1521 point zero eight twenty two point zero six forty three point zero one of the greater bendigo planning scheme the proposal does not comply with Clause 55.0 two one neighborhood character objectives and is inconsistent with the purposes of clause 32 point zero eight general residential zone which calls for near development to respect neighborhood character and three the proposal does not comply with the objectives of clauses 55 point zero two one one fifty five point zero three one fifty five point zero three two fifty five point zero or 150 5.05 for fifty five point zero five five fifty five point zero six six one of the existing dwelling that subdivided into two lights and constructed of dwelling on each lot there is a consistent theme that emerges from the planning officer report on a proposal while the demolition of the existing non-contributory building is supportive the proposed design of the new dwellings is not considered complementary to the Heritage and neighborhood character requirements of the precinct the objectives of the heritage policies said to ensure that infill development and new buildings do not adversely affect the character or appearance of the heritage present and a visually recessive issues identified with this proposal include front and side setbacks and the height scale and bulk of the proposed dwellings setback guidelines set front setbacks that are consistent with the joining contributory elements and side setbacks that are common within the precinct the proposal sets a ground-floor step back at four point five four methods for the no-fee Australian property compared to the neighbouring properties front setback of seven point four meters it is suggested that as a minimum the setback of the neutral and should be no less than the six point one eight leaders of the existing heritage officer has raised concerns that the proposed setback of the upper floors is not sufficient to lessen their dominance within the streetscape noting that there is still significant bulk at the upper level this aspect is a particularly important given the site 's corner location guidelines around their suspect require an overall building height that should not dominate contributory buildings when viewed from both streets the impact of the proposed two-story structure is considered most detrimental to the adjoining heritage building on Maple Street due to it being to it being only two metres from the boundary and having a substantial reform the proposal is also assist as in distant with several rest code clauses these are outlined within the report and essentially the issues relate to those already discussed the applicant has contacted counselors and provided their perspective on the process involved in this application the frustration with the process is evidence of a response to counselors from the planning department addressing the issues that have been raised was received a short time ago council officers have concluded this that scale of the proposed development is disproportionate to the requirement to be visually recessive it is this asset assessment that the applicant is in most disagreement with feeling that this application has not been treated consistently with other developments in the area also believing that the applet application is respectful of the heritage guidelines and most importantly did not attract any objections from neighboring properties given the finality of granting a permit I feel it is difficult for a counselor to ignore the advice and recommendations given by the Heritage and planning officers in this instance as a site 's prominent location and it 's necessitates that any development must be appropriate should counsel move to refuse the permit and further appeal avenues can be sought by the applicant and it may be worthwhile that ways being explored for this application Thank You counsel Metcalf counts more eman thank you very very comprehensive outline of the actual proposal from councilor Metcalf thank you it is a very interesting street driving a passed it again today on that Napier Street you 've got some beautiful mature old Elms and on all the street itself you 've got some mature nice old our bluestone gutter the building itself is a non contribute tree as a heritage item but the big concern is the excessive bulk this is always an interesting position for council to be navigating as we do want infill but we do want to sound protect and maintain our neighborhood character but also the heritage assets there were requests from Council to amend the plans so that the plan wouldn 't actually dominate the streetscape and as this domination of the heritage assets that do exist in that Street if you go for a drive down you 'll see some beautiful old Victorian weather boards and some other contributing buildings as well do have been spent a bit of time and a bit of love and tenderness and they do look absolutely fantastic and I 've seen a lot of negotiations between the planning department and developers and I think the outcomes when we work together are extraordinary and do ensure that these heritage precincts and the neighborhood character are protected and preserved but I think in this instance a potential unwillingness to amend plans has certainly led do support the recommendation and the sentiments of councillor Metcalfe thank you Thank You councillor anyone council Roldan thanks Mary wrote this application meets a number of standards but as councillor Metcalfe has comprehensively outlined the overall objectives of the planning scheme are not met just quite private open space being fenced off there 's issues of concern including the departure from and the lack of respect for the existing neighborhood character by virtue of excessive bulk of the building as Council n monitors pointed out we try to accommodate the rate of growth that may deep but that may decrease the overall livability of our city the process we need is to be mindful not to endorse development for developments sake the challenge is that areas that are highly accessible are also often the areas that if heritage and neighborhood character values these character values mean that high-density housing needs to be a very high design standard according to the state government practice note understanding neighborhood character and areas character can be described as the combination of the public and private realms every property public place or piece of the cumulative impact of all these contributions that establishes neighbourhood character granted there may be frustrations and perceptions of communication issues with many planning applications but those things aside we need to consider the character in the places we love and value in this case I support the recommendation for refusal thanks councillor Olin other councillors that would like to speak summing up council Metcalfe put the motion all those in favor and go KarenT now move to item three well-being and fairness and three point one is the community engagement policy review of 2020 and we have a recommendation from the officers there Thank You councilman Earth and second in council old and councillor Metcalf Thank You Mara Brooke the recommendation before us is that council 1 approved the removal of the City of Greater Bendigo community engagement policy 2016 and so approving a doctor City of Greater Bendigo community engagement policy 2020 in preparing to speak to this tonight a revered the Vargo report on public participation and community engagement in the local government sector it says councils make decisions about a diverse range of community needs and can help better inform local government policies and their transaction into effective strategies to programs and projects the real-life experiences of community stakeholders can make a valuable contribution to decision making and an open and deliberative process can enhance stakeholders perception of the credibility of a decision regardless of the side of the project we would expect to see documented evidence that councils have understood better practice principles when designing and implementing their public participation activities the recommendations from the Vigo report were that all councils 1 assisted public participation policies and associated resources against the International Association for public participation IOP to model and update them as necessary and promote leaders throughout the council and to build monitoring reporting and evaluation activities into their public participation activities and three developer dr. document comprehensive public participation plans and their outcomes state government legislation requires that local government must have a community engagement policy and community engagement principles the drop policy before suspends are an extensive feedback and this in community engagement policy complies with the state government requirements and the Vargo recommendations great work by Fiona I hope the council Metcalfe cancel wrong thanks Marek yeah the local government bill 2019 has just been passed by both houses of the Victorian Parliament and in sections 55 and 56 it mandates local government authorities to have a community engagement policy and community engagement principles the city of Greater Bendigo is community engagement policy of 2016 was due to be reviewed in 2018 but was delayed due to the introduction of the new local government bill to be honest I was surprised that any authority that deals with the public would not have had one elsewhere councils reviews has taken into account as we 've heard the Victorian Auditor General 's report on public participation and community engagement the Department of premier and cabinet 's draft public engagement framework the Local Government Act of 1989 and the new local government bill of 2019 in October 2000 19 in this place we authorized the progression of the review and public consultation and the review itself was an exercise in community engagement the adoption of the policy will allow the Community Engagement guidelines and toolkit to be reviewed over the coming year and community be in place by March 2021 done well when the community has provided the necessary information to form an opinion they can influence part or all of the decision making process this is the essence of participatory democracy by being transparent providing clarity consideration of inclusion access and participation by closing the loop and undertaking evaluation local governments can maintain the best interests in their communities at heart is this not why we are here I commend the recommendation Thank You councillor Oldham other councillors that would like to speak count sorry mine I 've just briefly Mary walking an interesting item for us to be discussing tonight as well look I think even though they the bill was moved by both houses a state parliament and ratified yesterday that the city of Greater Bendigo was on the front and ensuring that our Community Engagement policies are up-to-date our transparent and are accessible to the community and like being a council your one vote amongst nine and it doesn 't necessarily mean whilst you 're voices who the outcome is necessarily going to reflect what you contribute and community engagement about wanting to listen to the broader community there are times when maybe single voice or a other voice may not necessarily make it into the final tough I think that is possibly the the reality of living in a democracy as well but the importance that we do have community engagement we are genuine about that community engagement and community engagement does drive a lot of the policies and strategies that we are delivering as a city so I think this is a great outcome and just to thank all the team in the organization and particularly now they 're working out of their new digs and to continue to do good work and to fiona German particularly who 's continuing to deliver great outcomes for the city thank you thank you can 't sorry Mon other councillors that would like to speak know something up counts makeup I put the motion all those in favor against carried our next item on the agenda is three point two which is the Catherine McAuley college joint use agreement and there 's an officer recommendation there on page 58 so I Thank You counsel thank you I 'd like to the council one agree to the joint development and use of sporting and community facilities between the City of Greater Bendigo and mercy education limited at the Catherine colleague College kulak campus for the term of 35 years to authorize the city of Great Bend go chief executive officer to undertake the necessary administrative steps to enter into a joint user and development agreement with Mercy Education limited and McCawley property limited three commits to funding 50% of detailed design and construction costs of the joint use facilities up to a total of seven million dollars for authorized councils staff appointed to the Catherine McAuley college construction project control group to approve the variations to construction costs for the project within the agreed Council funding commitment and five commit councils 50% share of operation of ongoing operational costs of the joint use areas so again we can see from this report that an awful lot of consultation and work has gone into ensuring that this will be a good outcome for the City of Greater Bendigo with such a growing population need more sporting and community facilities so this joint user agreement assist the city in making such facilities more accessible for the whole community councils come through financial contribution to this venture all those sounding and like an enormous amount of funds will be spread across a number of years as NS within budget so risk factors that have also been thoroughly assessed and reviewed and I just think this would be a great project and one that I look forward to watching develop Thank You councillor Hawke councillor Park Thank You mayor Thank You councillor Hall kids this is the wider future we will be having more and more joint use facilities because we can 't provide all the facilities that are needed and certainly schools and other organizations like that which have great community impact great community presence they will not be able to fund it all of it so coming together not only do we have a better outcome but we can attract some extra synergies as well and this instance about the Northern District or Northern Rivers cricket team and that is that is a way in cricket here is a pathway here you can get that specialist coaching you can get that specialist work just like the Academy is fought and so on like that this operates here I think one of the exciting things about this is the fact that advancing the growing area it is in an area that does need a lot more I want a lot more open space for our sporting facilities both passive and an active recreational facilities and certainly I think it 's one that we shall be exploring not only with the Catholic education system and the private education system but also with the Victorian Government education system as well too it does provide those facilities for the students during the day community during the evening and after and the weekends does provide active use all the time so that there is less vandalism and so on like that but more importantly it stands there as a symbol of this is something that you can do to a young people it 's insist for them you can become a cricket so you can become a basketball star favor of this I think it 's something that we should be working at yes we will come across difficulties and so on like that yes we will need to on the mouth but more importantly I think as we go we will learn from those mistakes and those those little variances and make sure that the future ones will be even better so I do commend this I think it 's a great step forward for both the community and for the college and certainly for the juvett into area as well thank you Thank You counsel if I for the councillors that would like to speak councillor Metcalf thank you Mary I had a question that said that ice listening post about my council agrees to a joint development use of sporting and community facilities for schools it 's an easy one for me to answer this allows Council to provide sporting facilities that have Ashley reduced cost as opposed to doing it on their own provides more infrastructure than either party could do on its own Council doesn 't have to purchase land to develop the sporting the councillors contribution and council has the open go show the length of the repayment plan it provides sporting grounds in a growth area and makes use of an otherwise vacant space outside of school hours these are all pluses for me and ultimately the community is the winner here the active living census shows that we have a shortage of cricket facilities in the city of Greater Bendigo and this will help address this shortage there are always learnings from each joint you should join us agreement and I believe this one reflects some of those earlier learnings I 'm very comfortable in supporting this recommendation thanks very much councillor Metcalf other councillors that would like to speak councillor Iman not just briefly mayor I think this is a wonderful opportunity for the city we do have a number of different joy user agreements in place um working successfully others less than successfully but I can take some comfort from the conversations and the briefings that we have had that this joint User Agreement will be beneficial to the community on paper things can look wonderful and the benefits rubber hits the road and stakeholders are having to negotiate or play nicely there I say that we do see are we actually benefitting as a community as of 5050 or are we sort of the second-rate citizens but I think this one will have a tremendous outcome for the epilogue Ward and the City of Greater Bendigo if not the broader region given this the state size and capacity of the facility but look like all the joint user agreements good strong relationships a commitment to community and in this instance to education I think we 'll have a good outcome at the end of the day thank you thanks council Ramon other councils that would like to speak in summing up council Hulk good council as I 'll put the motion all those in favor against Kerry we now move to item 3.3 on the agenda Golden Square swimming pool council report fire damage and do I have a recommendation thank you can 't sorry Mon someone just sorry so what discounts we want thank you Thank You Marilyn I 'd like to move that council one notes the future of the golden square swimming pool which includes that a decision on the future of the pool will be revisited in April 2022 note the requests for additional information and clarification that have been received from key stakeholders including representatives from the golden square pool committee and three supports the deferral of consideration of the matter until June 2020 ordinary meeting of council to enable further stakeholder engagement to be undertaken look I think the the motion sorry that 's the only I 'm someone to move that Thank You council fine thank you um now council Iman thank you very well but I think the motion does State for itself and from the questions this evening the multiple emails that we received over the last week now that a deferral is not something that council does take lightly and I think this is extraordinary circumstances and without commitment to community engagement and the last genuine piece of joint user group engagement being May last year I do note that the user groups have been meeting informally and I do get a sense that all user groups do form of mutual mutual benefit so I think the the motion is important it is important that as a city that we do respect our stakeholders needs and to ensure that the adequate amount of consultation is undertaken I don 't think I 've read an email that was who was happy with the proposed recommendation in its previous form and I do think the additional time will be important to ensure that we do bring the community along with my quote councillor Williams bring the community along to ensure that we can find a solid way forward thank you thanks very much council ream on other councillors oh sorry cancel a five-second Nick that 's alright happy to be overlooked Thank You mayor thank you can sorry mom yes I agree with this one I think in this instance we do need to consider it a little more clearly a little more time and a little bit more depth and I have two reasons for that one is the one that councilor mm has just articulated and that is by continuing the dialogue we can probably reach a better have any dialogue at all well probably although we 've had dialogue so far probably don 't have a sufficiently high and intense level so that 's a way for it can be mapped out really the other thing is that I have noticed and among the particularly presentation from the people from the pool committee pool committee sorry that there 's a number of questions that they want at clarification of and I think that this process of deferring it will allow us to sort that out communicate with them in a clear and concise way about what the questions are what the meaning is and certainly I think that from there we can get a better solution for them for the for the cricket club for the football club and for the bottom in croquet fraternity what we have is the creek tribe saying that the Pearl decision needs everyone coming together and talking about it and I think that we need to respect that community you put that even if it is here tonight and we are here to take on board all the logic comments right I think that that for me resonated resonated particularly acutely and I think that we should be taking this time for a little bit longer a little bit more in depth analysis and I think we can probably get a better result thank you thanks very much Council five other councils that would like to speak Council rolling Thanks mirror look poor communication has been the hallmark of this whole process and the Golden Square community are the poorer for it the fact that no party had seen the recommendation in the council agenda prior to its release to the public is very poor indeed lack of certainty at the end of the 2020 pool season is in part due to the absence of a promised comprehensive aquatic strategy meant to guide decision making for the pool by this time but for some still unexplained reason this strategy was not progressed as expected and a draft has more recently been put together it 's clear it 's not coming to us for approval in the near future I believe this to be a big error of judgment on counsels behalf risen steadily since the opening of Gauri Wayne Yarra attendee numbers beyond expectations at Gore Yvonne Yara are a great thing despite the huge costs to the ratepayers that exists with such an energy baseline but the golden square pool continues to achieve for the community in fact this hard-working local group is a shining light that is achieved outstandingly providing much-needed facilities for local families and our community some sector question diminish or discredit these achievements I say they are a credit to all involved achievements such as a swim safe program with the rotten campus the multicultural service water aerobics yoga and Zumba classes the fourth largest outdoor Vik swim program in the state school swimming and other family focused events and a community garden eighty-five volunteers being recipients of the volunteering Vik Innovation Award for youth being with recipients of the 2019 Victorian regional achievement and Community Award running a fossa bill staff well-being programme and having a new four-year strategic plan this community in general was being treated unfairly through the uncertainties of this whole process it 's being mentioned that some of the user groups believe that not all groups have been present at all times reading the dozens of letters of support for the pool the last couple of days has been very moving it 's obviously highly valued by so many people so where does that leave our decision-making it was an insurance claim for fire damage to some of the pool storage areas that brought forward the decision about the pools future by a month I cannot support a deferral when I 'm not confident that the required communication will achieve the results claimed by some what I do know is that if there is to be a new recommendation in future that it should be developed in conjunction with the pool and the pool only and only after genuine communication thanks counsel Roldan other councillors would like to speak councillor horn I support the motion put forward tonight by councillor Iman probably a little bit more it 's more selfishly actually this because I too feel like I need a lot more information to make you a really informed decision particularly since I am playing catch-up as I continue to do heard a lot from the members of the golden square pool community and have welcomed some more recent contact from other stakeholders which is good I would like for the time to consider the Golden Square recreation master plan as well as I actually didn 't know about that until just earlier this year as well so I 'm a lot more comfortable with this recommendation put forward by councillor anyone particularly because it allows me to make a really informed decision which is what I want to do with all decisions on council thanks thanks very much council hulk other councils can 't somewhat make up Thank You Miravalle I cannot support the recommendation that is printed in the agenda nor the alternative one for deferral of the decision so will be abstaining from this vote I hope making the decision to abstain from a vote but both recommendations make me feel uneasy and I would deal with this separately although the global square pill committee may have initially been pleased to see approval was being given to extend the pills operation for further four years recommendation contained in C and D need clarification and I have received multiple emails from the pool user community regarding this I have no answers for the people contacting me and if I feel my integrity has been compromised by this recommendation if I were to support it that 's something I 'm not prepared to give away the golden square fill committee members and users quite rightly picked up on the news with which this bill could be closed should the recommendation has stated be carried the alternative recommendation before us tonight to delay the decision for three months feels like a recommendation made on the rung there are consequences in delaying there 's the decision that effect the golden square pill community being able to get on with the jobs thing they 're doing the offseason like applying for grant funding you can 't apply for grants if you don 't know if the pool will be able open in the 2021 season the deferral of consideration until the June 2020 council meeting to enable her to stakeholder engagement to be undertaken it 's the aspect of the recommendation on fine to revisit the continuation of the golden square pool in April 2020 despite this the Bendigo Aquatic stratagem gongs Square represent my stureplan both documents that are required to inform councillors about future development decisions in this present I 'm not completed and available advice counsel sac received is that it may be up to four years before theirs are completed hence the original recommendation to continue the operation of the pool for a further four years the mirror also referred to the four in a response to a question on goddess where pill that came up earlier in question time tonight other user groups in the area are understandably frustrated with the lack of progress of the golden square represent master plan as they too would like to see some certainty provided to their organizations about future development in the pre suit however until their strategies are available do you I believe we are considering tonight is whether the call is to continue not to get used user group input into the future of the precinct that is a separate issue I cannot reconcile the idea that will suddenly three months time after waiting already for two years neither am i confident that any meetings between the various uses of the precinct over the next three months might lead to an amicable outcome and solution for everyone involved considering there 's only been one meeting of the user groups in ten months in a time where the whole world is experiencing unprecedented fear and uncertainty this recommendation only heightens those feelings for a community that I identified last month as living the faith of the world 's most livable community something this council spicy City to be I apologized last month for not being able to give the pill committee a decision prior to the pill season finishing I apologize again this month though I do not have the necessary information available to assist councillors in making decisions for this precinct two years on from the last decision what I have now I believe is a nothing response on an emotive and important issue this is a bold square pearl for the use of the represent and every right to be angry councillor Metcalfe you 'll need an extension rolled and all those in favor again it 's carried thanks council makeup thank you the users of the golden square pool and the users of the requisite have every right to be angry and disappointed with the situation they are now we I cannot support either recommendation but would support the decision being delayed from one month until April in line with the original motion the wishes of the rec Reserve music groups so that the clarification around the consequences of courses be C and D can be thank you thanks counsel Metcalfe other councillors it would like to speak all right councillor Iman in summing up thank you Mary Roark counsels lovely stated their opinion I think what my reason for running for council as per this decision that does reflect everything that I stand for and that is genuinely listening to your community the recommendation on the run it 's not a recommendation in response to community need community concern a community desire it is some people have stated very clearly they can 't support it a thorough I say deferral is vital for all user groups down over a three-month period and work their way through this process I 'm here for my community and I think this recommendation to defer is a direct response from the needs and not one user group but from multiple user groups who are all unhappy there 's no magic fairy dust that 's going to come up with a magic solution until people sit around the table and we all work through this together we are answer the questions we provide clarity and we seek a resolution now nobody knows what that may look like until we get the user groups in the room so I do strongly recommend to councillors that a deferral is important it does enable all those questions to be answered in a timely matter and it does so in a way that was directly addresses community need thank you Thank You councillor Iman with that the alternate motion I put that motion all those in favor against and one understand yeah thank you division so division those for councillor Iman council FLAC Council of five for council hulk and councillor org against council Roldan Holden can I get you to just tilt your microphones a bit more so when did you speak it 's not coming clear that 's right so when you speak next time it 's just not easy to hear thank you we now move to item four strengthening the economy and four point one which is the rail transport link and there 's a officer recommendation there on page 79 Drive someone to move Thank You counsel Metcalf and second and counsel five council met comfort Thank You mayor overall the recommendation is one that council adopt the core principle that any solutions for the future development of rail infrastructure and networks throughout Victoria including the Mel Melbourne Airport rail lead now should not disadvantage the future growth and prosperity of the Greater Bendigo region nor impact in a negative way Bendigo stability to connect with and travel to and from this state 's capital city to advocate to both the state Commonwealth government 's the importance of both levels of government committed to a Melbourne Airport rolling that provides for world-class Airport train connectivity that takes pressure off congested 's largest regional centres that supports state and Commonwealth government policies to strengthen regional Australia when position of sunshine is the only stop on an express service between the airport and Melbourne three advocate for further improvements to the Bendigo rail line including duplication of the rail track between Bendigo and Canton here chuckling and the Swan Hill line to improve services for northern Victoria to and from Melbourne for right to the Prime Minister the premier the Victorian Minister for transport infrastructure and the Commonwealth Minister for infrastructure transport and regional development advising councils position and fire support that the further development of the Bendigo Mitchell metro rail project and the future upgrade to the Eagle Hall Tim award to Denali line when passenger and freight tomorrow warrants such an upgrade I was expecting counselor Wilson to be here to talk about science and I thought we would be asking for an extension of time so Mike what I have to say is actually quite light on the five points are going to be congra this recommendation highlights the high-level principles for the council to support I 've taken established ranked old tables train tracks and train bridges he shared with me some of his learnings over the decades this include the importance of standardizing the guide just across the state which half of the state already complies with this and recreating the the double track between Bendigo and cotton which allows for a neutrally improved service and is more regular more frequent more reliable and most of the time much faster some of the timetables would have shown us that they haven 't been improvements in train service over the last 20 years I never thought in my role as a counselor that I would be looking at rail bridges and rail tracks and timetables but it 's been an interesting process and I 'll support this recommendation thanks Council Metcalf council fight Thank You Man thank you can submit caffee I was expecting that accounts already was together and I was prepared to have two extensions and then no more nevertheless here we are debating it and it really is a very very important concept that we are debating and or indeed giving direction for our city it says that it 's important that the position for for the city be clarified during a period where specific options in engineering solutions are being debated which may or might not be to the benefit of Bendigo in the long term and then I think is the craft some of the five points that have been made in the recommendation we do need to make sure that we are advocating for the best possible solution for our community and indeed the community all the way up along the Calder even beyond here in Bendigo this at the moment we 're looking at various individual options individual engineering solutions and certainly some of those are benefitting some communities and to the detriment of others or at least not improving the lot of the rest of it so what we need to do is to make sure that we bring our information into the into the decision-makers for their information into our community and our politicians so that they understand where we are coming from why we 're coming from that and that is to make sure that argument is a a source of income for jobs and so on like that yeah what we have here is something that we need to make sure that we pass it so that we can then go with maturity to the decision-makers in Canberra and also in Spring Street with a clear story a clear message and the clear anticipation of what we want for our community thank you Thank You councillor five other councillors that would like to speak no I 'll put the motion all those in favor against carried we now move to item 7 lead and government for all and the internal audit plan of 2019 223 and there 's an opposite recommendation on page 84 Thank You council Rowland to move and council on Metcalf to second council rollin thanks Mary Roark I 'd like to move the recommendation that council 1 on the recommendation of the audit and Risk Committee approved the internal audit plan for 2019 223 to approve for the audit and Risk Committee to make non material changes to the plan and three notes that the audit and Risk Committee have endorsed the plan to have an internal audit plan approved by council in july 2019 af-s were appointed going to take a review and the initial internal audit plan focused on two areas of waste services and long-term financial planning this has been followed by a risk assessment and development of a comprehensive draft internal audit plan for the next four years we endorsed this draft at a at our February audit and Risk Committee meeting the waste management audit was completed last year and will result in a resource recovery and education straight to support a range of decisions in future including waste charges with this strategy comes documentation of management process enhanced financial reporting internal monitoring and formalizing of accountabilities roles and responsibilities opportunities have been identified to strengthen the long term financial planning in the city of Greater Bendigo and that will enhance the long term financial plan and devise and devise a tool being able to guide budget decision-making and strategic initiatives is required with long term financial implications of decisions considered the internal audit plan is based on what we currently know about risks that face the city 2020 this assessment may need to change over time to accommodate new events additional events audits may then need to be undertaken and these may have budget consequences based on discussions today regarding risk assessment I 'm in full support of the plan and this annual review thank you very much councillor olden Council metcalfe Thank You mayor over the proposed internal audit program was reviewed by the audit and Risk Committee at the meeting on the 20th of February and one change was made to what was recommended by the auditor and is a comprehensive programme and there 's always more that could be done which he ordered you 're identified and I agree with counsel Alden that we may need to be flexible about what we look at with what we 're facing at the moment the February meeting was my first audit and Risk Committee meeting and the information provided by the auditor and the questions asked by the external members as well as councillors showed me that the committee members are doing their due diligence this should be reassuring to the members of the community I Matt can 't other councillors that would like to speak not coming up in councillor Oldham yeah thank you with that councils up with the motion all those in favor against carried we move now we have record of Assembly 's and we also have contracts I 'll move those together we were seven two and seven through Thank You councillor five and second councillor flack oh no urgent business no notice sorry oh sorry I 'm jumping here yeah I put the motion all those in favor against carry Matt no urgent business notices of motion councilors report and I 'll start with councillor hawk Thank You Mara rook um before I start I 'd just like to preface my report by saying that I actually wrote this over the weekend like I usually do getting ahead of the game with my work so one and things have changed quite a lot since then but in saying that oh okay I 'll forge ahead so since our last council meeting in February I 've attended 16 council related meetings or events despite some cancellations I won 't go into a really great one that I attended was the opening of the Bendigo Yacht Club 's new well fresco desk dead DEP sorry in late February and what a great venue I hope the Yacht Club market and really advertise their deck in this venue more it 's a great place that you can come and sit join them enjoy a drink and just take some views over Lake a look so I was invited to come back and have a go at sailing which I will definitely follow up when things settle down a little bit as mentioned also our two attended the young AFL w match at the QE o between July and Richmond I actually watch the match from the concrete stands around the edge of the oval so that I can you enjoy the match with my um daughter who has just recently taken up football in the past year as well so it was really great to actually be amongst the crowds and enjoy the atmosphere and rivalry between the teams it was another brilliant event for then you go celebrating women 's sport and for a little while so it 's good to say that over the long weekend the Saturday I attend the opening and celebration of ulka numerous Heathcott projects that have been completed in recent years and this is a great opportunity for me to go out to the heath cutbush market which I 'd missed out on earlier in the year because with a lesson we were going to have a listening post out there but we 've got rained out so it was great to spend some time and some money and some in a few shops out there so that was really good it was really busy couldn 't believe it it was great to just see so many people out about so outside of Council this month I also attended a national earlier summit in Melbourne and bear with me with this one this summit was dedicated to working towards improving the first 1000 days of a child 's life so the first 1000 days is from preconception to about two years of age and research shows us that adverse childhood experiences during this time including trauma geez creased exercise and play lack of attachment and some back-and-forth interactions all lead to poorer outcomes for children and these have long lasting effects relating to education employment and health now when I wrote this I wasn 't thinking about the cove of 19 but that isn 't going to be a trauma for some of our children that took cope with um which we need to take into account but I 'm also raising this because I actually wanted to acknowledge that recently in council papers at a briefing there was reference to the first 1000 days of life and the importance of the early years which I think 's really encouraging and I 'll continue to advocate and encourage and support this work on my timing council and hope to raise this issue within the Bendigo community as well because I think real change is only going to stem from community uprising so to speak and to do and I do think this is an area that the City of Greater Bendigo can lead in so we can build a stronger community for our families and children be really mindful of really supporting our children and our youth and our families and so that we don 't have to me to really adverse effects from that it 's going to be difficult but we all need to try and lastly I still speak last month about I 'm trying to juggle my time to win council work business and family needless to say I probably haven 't_''_5922.56 done as well as I would have liked and managing it these months but after that meeting it was really good to hear so many people acknowledge this struggle that we do have as counselors and here that the City of Greater Bendigo are committed to trying to make it a little easier for those who are in the workforce and those who do have families and family commitments to try and manage all the council obligations as it would be great to continue to encourage more diversity on council in our next turn oh we 've got that Thanks thank you very much councillor Hawke council Metcalf Thank You mirror look I 'm busy typing away because I have I do we 'll talk about the FLW again hearing Bendigo and even though the outcome wasn 't as I hoped the game was great and the venue was outstanding the crowd really appreciated the standard of the game and this was highlighted in sports reports on various networks that night Barrow mentioned about coffee bits on this game but I just like to reminder they 're still an outstanding coffee from where naval hot beds draft up field say in the BFL grand final a few years ago so I think we 're even now the lost trades fair at the racecourse and I agree with counsel are old and bad how lucky we are in having this event here and on the weekend we had it on in light of what 's happened since then the lost trades was amazing and the set up of the venue flowed really well the venue itself looked fantastic and big thank you to the Bendigo jockey club for the work they must have done in getting the that Gordon it helped to have two inches of rain in the week before however and I think any visitors to Bendigo would have gone away with a really favorable impression of the city Los Maldonado was invited to speak with prospective counselors for Goldfield Shire at Mary Barra in the leading excellence Maryborough 2020 I encourage them to put them hands up to be fair counselor I had lots of questions to ask about what the role involved and the feedback I received was I found this to be a useful session but being addict going on in the last month we have great water issues and possible solutions to these being out in the community is what I enjoy most about my role as a counsellor I know agree with councilor old and that our counselor reports in the coming months will be very light on it was only last weekend the counselor Williams and myself held a listening post at Epsom supermarket but it may have been the last one we have for a while I encourage residents to continue to make contact with their counselors by phone or email if they want to speak to us thank you thanks counselor star of year awards out at the All Seasons and it was quite a great night Bendigo Bank Dave councillors a warning to

elsewhere mom did a terrific job in launching debt that is a very talented group and certainly they do attract some some well the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and others to work with them and so as a result it gives their young pilots an opportunity to work with some of the best musicians are going around here in Victoria also attended the rotten to the International Executive of the wires international it 's a real honor that the international executive particularly the president who comes from South Australia nominated Bendigo it 's the price of that without halt there may be and certainly there were a terrific venture people and they 're really really curious about Bendigo and have what it is they spent the week here which is really great choice Oh next one this is the

council my look just so special and I really do appreciate that send to the Spanish Rocio festival with you here a rock what a what a terrific afternoon that was and what a chunk we had to leave when the dance we just got started so anyway I like that that 's also attended the culture o met McCann culture all McCann yeah that 's right last Sunday and that spike added a wonderful way of bringing people together but performers from different cultures we had a number of cultures including the number of Australian sitting around the edge and I was just absolutely staggered by one superb senior from South survey says that she 's just to Australia I 've got three albums out or surveys out for us to buy this haven 't_''_6334.29 been together the kids gave us feel here in vinegar will help me she needs promotion Thank You Man thanks very much Council of five councillor Iman thank you Mary Volk had the good fortune of speaking at the 1.6 billion ways to be Muslim exhibition an exhibition inspired by street art and focused on breaking down stereotypes of what is it to be a muslim australian and during the specialist acknowledging counselors williams and councillor five for the last term of Council and a fair and a good decision to make a better and a greater bendigo in regards to the planning applications for the Bendigo mosque and in the face of much opposition being strong and making a firm decision our launch of the Bendigo Symphony Orchestra a wonderful event and orchestral music is a vital part of Bendigo history a lot of German migrants came over during the gold rush and and still remember finding an old violin frame that guys let 's block on hardware street where the all Caesars now stands the old mr. Geiser parents quite for making violins out of eucalypt 8 native timber as well looking at the different resonances but the orchestral program that the Bendigo Symphony composers and also bringing in guest artists as well to help bolster up the capacity of that orchestra and must be admired unfortunately I 've shared this information on the back of our current code the 19 situation and many of those concerts and events may not go ahead but when the air does clear and there is the opportunity supporting these local community groups becomes absolutely vital it is definitely a time for us to be a gentler and a kinder community and to look after each other our neighbors and to ensure that we 're not knocking over the elderly or people that may have a disability in the pursuit of an item like toilet paper it demeans us all as a community so let 's be a lot gentler Bendigo is a great city we are a good community and I would really encourage all residents ratepayers citizens and visitors to to honor who we are as a city and to pursue that with a bigger and also had good fortune and invite it out to the Kangaroo Flat ourselves I having a look at their preparations security concerns they hadn 't some individual was stealing water from them sneaking up in early hours of the morning and turning on their tap and taking away vast amounts of of water very disappointing now councillors have mentioned the John Richmond AFL W again delighted our little daughter Daisy three months old the first book the man she 's ever attended was a female football match and there was a young girl in a tiger stop and she had a tutu on the Tigers top in a long stem flower and the ballet that insured consisted of I 'm sure a number of football mousse and impromptu emotions and I thought what an extraordinary point in history where young girls could go wherever they want whether it be football ballet CEO or me that the opportunities that do lay ahead and we 've definitely breaking that glass ceiling it 's wonderful and there 's a new father it gives me great comfort that now all children being a boy girl or identify in other ways do have opportunities found had a interesting time speaking to the students at Camp local government and I asked them if you 're a deputy mayor for a day what would you what would you do our recycling was a big issue it was a big issue on the minds of the students more splashbacks was another hot topic and a zoo was a hot on the heels and a few of the more mature teachers remember the old White Hills Botanical Gardens and those interesting monkeys that used to throw all sorts of interesting things that they for when they would visit so zoos sustainability and splash park seem to be some of the top areas to consider okay we just like also acknowledge the extraordinary work of the new CEO at the golden dragon museum the ebullition you guys been in the job for under two months I believe now and is proving to be an extraordinary contributor and not an easy job to step into given the the cultural in the family legacy and the work that has been done and substantial work that has been done over the years to ensure that Bendigo as Chinese community does have a strong continue to enable us to grow and expand and share that cultural asset that we do have here in the city so well done here you go unfortunately that museum is closed at the moment to to the curb in nineteen until just finally I catching up with Barry Johnson Barry is very passionate about a project called our coach check Barry amongst other things comes from a martial arts background that Barry has a genuine commitment to ensure that if a parent is taking a child to any sort of activity that there is a process to ensure that the people that you do leave your children with are the sort of people you want to be leaving your children with and that they have got whether the qualifications are working with children 's and every other issue is actually being addressed and I do salute him having spent a lot of time in the martial art circuits as a younger younger bloke and the Karate Kid is a great example you 've got all sorts who are teaching things to to individuals and to ensure that you 've sitting there guiding you these sort of things can become a wonderful life lessons that can carry you through a lifetime or there can be a more destructive element so I do salute Barry for his ongoing commitment to ensure that the activities our children are involved in activities that are going to be productive and healthy and continue their growth apart from that I 'm sure our council reports will be a little bit shorter next time but look everyone keep safe look after each other and if you 're desperate there 's a backyard house it might be able to do some cleaning for you thanks very much council anymore um not quite sure where you 're going with that but we won 't go there moving on to the Me 's report just a few items that I want to tick off that some have already mentioned I attended and spoke at the sod tuning of the Epsom skate park along with Council on Metcalf and councillor Williams and council petha Bridge and it was so good to see the community coming together and where that all from a member of our community of similars really great them and that work is being undertaken at the moment so it was a really good opportunity and we had the state government involved as well as they put funding in also council Amada myself attended the launch of the project compassion Caritas in the heart grows not seems like a long time ago doesn 't that Shrove Tuesday that eventers thing happening in Bendigo for something like 22 years I didn 't realise with project compassion that our region is actually I think about the second nationally in terms of funding that it raises for the charities associated with Caritas all the schools that are involved and the organizers said that they wanted to pass on to council because they were the envy of all of their other colleagues in that work that they do enabling that event to take place in the mail and Karen and her team Bernie and your directorate and what they did in enabling that to happen and lots of pancakes obviously being made and schoolchildren with concerts and singing and it really was mere sorry attended with the the Youth Council mayor and deputy mayor elections that night we came in here to the council chamber we 've got nine new youth counselors joining those that have remained with us obviously some of made commitments for study and and while there was commitments for overseas study as well but that 's being changed we 've got such great nominations as we 've spoken before and we 've got two people in Ryan and Billy who will be very admirable leaders of our Youth Council for this year hosted Amira welcome for the lost rates fair and both council I met calf and Alderman spoke about lost rates fear Lisa and Glen rondelle have really put that into such an event to have 20,000 people visiting that out at the racecourse was brilliant and again Terry caramel Udhas and his team in enabling that to happen was just outstanding and the feedback from people stallholders from all over Australia and some international and Lisa and Glen they couldn 't have been happier than the jockey club in the support that they have done their heath care over the last four years close to four million dollars with the projects the public toilets most use public toilets in City of Greater Bendigo as part of the toilet strategy being replaced the old ones have been knocked down works at the senior citizens with a new roof a pedestrian bridge over the Chauncey over Chauncy Street RSL amenities so toilets in the RSL Hall as well the bowls club having some works done there berrak Reserve works being finished off as well it 's some pretty amazing and I have to say advanced Heath getting the community out there with their community plan they 've worked really solidly over a number of years in advocating for the things that are important for the Heathkit community our second largest township in the in the municipalities so I want to say well done to all of them I laid a wreath at the sand Arkin commemorative service last weekend it 's one of the most emotional services that I think the RSL do there are so many but again and speaker whose parents were actually part of the the people in those communities did and sacrificed for the POWs was outstanding it was again as I said a very memorable event lots of people have attended it 's the only memorial of such I think in Australia so again hats off to the RSL to Peter and his team on the work that they do and they do that all so well and how they remember our fallen those who have served and those that continue to serve our citizenship ceremony attended by 55 new citizens we do have some that that weren 't able to come it was a reduced number obviously with the Kovach 19 we did have a bit of a change in our protocols it was it 's a bit awkward when you 're a shake your hand touching fairly tight person but remembering our social distancing that still went ahead they were very grateful that it went ahead because they know that you know that could have changed post Monday as well again everyone 's doing lots of work I was off club last week for a few days thank you to councillors out on commitments the Kalends is looking very quiet over the next couple of weeks as we all bunker down and do what we need to do for our community and for our family and friends so with that I 'll hand over though the CEO thank you very rock coyotes also mention the Local Government Act which went through the state government Parliament this weekend was passed by state government a lady royal is said of course now but that 'll be a pretty significant change for local government in Victoria we look forward to the guidance will be provided by local government Victoria and the state government as to the introduction of that and what the input into what the challenges will be particularly in the lead-up to the election later this year speaking of which we had our first candidate information session early last week the Honorable Bob Cameron and the Honorable Janette pal where our guest speakers and they did a great job talking about the relationship between government and the importance of local government the importance of being a good counselor and being a good give some new consideration to how we might hold those future candidate emotion sessions going forward I would just like to focus the rest of my report on the current circumstances around covert 19 and the processes that we 're going through to respond to council and community needs clearly the federal and state governments elites in this pandemic today are setting the rules based on the best evidence and advice that they are able to receive there are no doubts the health of all community members is paramount in all decision-making on this matter and we 've had to make we 've made some public announcements this week about how we 've had to change our work you 've all talked about the events that you 've been to over the last month and we 're all disappointed that there won 't be many events over the next month going forward in terms of the things that we do so well in Bendigo in Greater Bendigo on how we love our events I unfortunately aren 't going to be able to be held and you know the ones that writers festival grooving the moves being cancelled the Bendigo venues and events programs being cancelled so we don 't know really the impact of that yet and it 's going to be challenging for us as an organisation but for our community as well in preparing our current and future decisions we 've been using the following principle so I just like to walk away through those if I 'm a primary that is decreasing the risk of cross infection flattening the curve we 're calling it and this been referred to at state and federal level reducing the likelihood of of the current I 'd covered 19 pandemic and its impact on our community so supporting social distancing we 're practicing that tonight strengthening infection control and making sure that we do wash their hands a lot we do make sure that we respect others independent increase their hygiene as best we can and limit interactions with others and that 's one of the things that would be challenged by the most I think because we are sociable people as to limit those interactions we want to rely on 've got the best information available before we make decisions we 're aligning our decisions with our culture and one of the significant parts of our culture in our organization as we care we care for each other as an organization we care strongly for our community we want to focus our effort on maintaining the services to the community wherever we possibly can and in particular supporting the vulnerable people in our community and we also want to think about decreasing the impact on the economy in the decisions that we might be making sure that wherever possible we 're helping the economy continue to operate Viki Mason has been appointed within our organization as a pandemic coordinator and that will be her full-time role for a period of time so you know we 're taking this very seriously as an organization we want to make sure we 're across the detail of making decisions in a very timely way meetings have been held daily within our organization and with others across our Greater Bendigo and making sure that information is shared and we 'll be trying to do we can we 're trying to understand the impact on community and economy on health and well-being and again we don 't understand all of that yet but we 'll do our best to get our head around that and and to make sure we stay abreast of that and clearly staying closely connected to the likes of bending your health the HHS and others it 's clearly a time for strong leadership across Greater Bendigo and there are many leaders in Greater Bendigo stepping up in their leadership to do the best they can to tackle this significant challenge and I think today 's meeting me was a good example of some people coming together to start to think about how we can work together and I 'd like to recognize the role that our organisations playing in this work and thanks to Vicki and others many people in our organization working hard try and make sure we as best prepared as we can be like others I ask that we all work together we respect each other 's needs rights and responsibilities in this area but most of and support each other through this challenge will be in front of us for a little while thank you thanks very much Craig I now move for the meeting to close as we have confidential reports to consider some of the recommendation Thank You Council five and seconded council FLAC all those in favor against Carrie _"

    "text": "the exercise is what you want to make it yourself if you want to work really really hard it can be hard exercise but for me it 's just keeping things moving and move it 's perfect name for it we 're designed to move so we really need to keep moving there 's no hard and fast rule on how to do exercise it 's just moving your body social interaction is a very important part of our health and well-being and if we 're exercising at the same time it 's a bit of a bonus so it 's great to just share time together and celebrate each other 's achievements in life and enjoy your moment together and you can see that there are people out there that just because you 've turned a certain age doesn 't mean that you 're limited what you can at least have a go at i can easily spend a lot of time in my recliner and so this is very good i think you 've got to move it or lose it it 's fun you do things at a whole lot more and do a whole lot more than what i thought i could and i 'm not going to break we have a go at anything you know just makes me feel good just get up and have a go [Music] so this is a bollywood dance program for six weeks and it 's in mildura victoria it 's to be able to learn the bollywood culture the dance just enjoying the rhythm getting your body move and that physical workout as well i 'm really a very badly coordinated person but i love music but you know it helps with your balance and i 've always wanted to do indian dancing well we 're sitting in the murbin bowling club which is certainly an icon of murbane what we hope that the participants will get out of the activities is learning a new skill having some fun enjoyment and just getting out there and being a bit social and involved in the community as well well that 's good you 're after the kitty it 's going to pick it up the greatest challenge is trying he beat me in the pace last sunday him and his partner yeah but it was a privilege really to get beaten by the idea was to get people over 65 to to move it to get out of their house to come out here to enjoy the vista of the golf club and to learn a little bit about planet i didn 't start playing any sport until after i was 40 i took up tennis and then a friend said oh come out to the golf with us so i gave up tennis and started playing golf and thoroughly enjoy it getting out and enjoying yourself and exercising and everything yeah good for you oh beautiful perfect beautiful straight up people who socialize and join with other people seem to live longer and healthier lives so you can move if you want to it doesn 't matter if it 's just a little move everyone has a great giggle we 're not you know dancing for sheep stations we 're just having a fun time there 's always someone you haven 't haven 't met and sometimes we for your morale and yeah an age is no barrier you could be young you could be middle-aged or you could be in your 60s and believe me you 'll still get out and enjoy good for the spirit yeah that 's why i 'm outta here [Music] it 's easy not to exercise when you get to your 60s so it has to be fun i think to get you out there we 're in castle maine in central victoria in the botanic gardens under a beautiful tree hula hooping and enjoying it and sharing it with others and learning hula hooping is a wonderful core exercise it 's a cardio exercise it 's left right being connection it 's coordination all those things but mostly i see people get like really empowered because people come along and go oh i can 't pull a hoop oh no that i 'm going to find this really hard and by the end of each class they 've all done i reckon between three or four things that they didn 't think they could do everyone 's commented that they feel so they 're getting a good workout that 's fun you know they 're not going to sit there and do 20 minutes of sit-ups but they can happily sit there and do 20 minutes of hula hooping and they get the same effect you know there 's a whole lot of different health factors that are going to be influenced positively by people exercising regularly so the more people that do that the better their quality of life longevity it 's just the most important thing as you age to keep active there 's just so much research to show that we have to keep moving and that we need to do some weight bearing you know even a very simple weight bearing of very light weights uh increases your bone density so our age it 's very very important to do weight bearing exercises and to keep moving i 've never been a joiner until recently but if i hadn 't joined different things i would just be i wouldn 't know anyone during the exercise class of course so that 's kept me very active but also she 's an exercise physiologist so she leads the class and she targets them specifically for our balance and to prevent falls and if you do fall or if you do get down on the ground getting them muscles to the point where they can actually push you up [Music] when i moved here i was a very solitary person i liked my own company i loved walking and i knew even though my family lived here i knew that i had to get out and make my own friends and contacts we 're in romsey at the ramsey recreation center today we had the back in the game program running it 's not about being able to shoot the hoops or what have you um everybody 's sort of just there for the same reason i think everybody seems to have a great time our neighbours across the road introduced themselves they 're very nice same age bracket said come along and it 's been great because we 've been able to not only exercise with physical but you 're cognitive and also to meet people here that we away before i think with all physical activity it 's 50 physical activity and physical social activity or even more the other way and i think some people might be lack the confidence or feel i can 't do it but there isn 't anything that i 've ever been along to where there hasn 't been assistance from everybody because they 've all been through the same boat when they joined anything or i 'm not sure you know this and will i fit in and if you don 't want to get old do this what we 're doing even though i 've never been a sports person i thought i 'd give it a go and just haven 't looked back [Music] i was really down i 'd put on weight i couldn 't be bothered i was tired mentally all the time and julie my friend said hey you know let 's get out we 've got to get out let 's go for a walk so five o 'clock i knocked off work went for walk every night and it 's amazing how it just how i felt so from that we continued on doing these classes that bullet shall have put on which is really good because that 's kept us going and got us a step further ahead with um getting our own fitness back to where we can have it at our age [Music] sympathy next year i just like doing things but body 's broken up being a couple of accidents and things and i come into this sort of thing it 's just funny fantastic people that come to my programs i 've noticed they 're more become more outgoing they 've made connections with other people so the activity is just part of it and things appeal to different people and this really appeals to me and i think that 's why i keep coming back i love our young instructor she makes it interesting and enthusiastic today we 'll just be doing a lot on balance a little bit of coordination some strength exercises i 'm the fit one in the family and i need to preserve that so yeah yeah you 're not limited by your size and have a go [Music] if you can just encourage people to come along and they suddenly think oh yes i can do this i don 't have to sit at home and be lonely you know because it 's a great social outing as well as relatively easy exercise you 're not pumping iron and it 's fun that 's the main thing so we are at murrabit public hall and we are doing line dancing and we have ladies come from pyramid hill swan hill karang calibal and they come here every thursday to do two hours of wine dancing otherwise you 're sitting home well i would be just sitting home watching telling and doing nothing well i used to be a ballroom dancer and did danced open amateur competition but when you haven 't got a partner line dancing is perfect so it 's good exercise i love the music and it really gets me going so it 's fabulous our oldest is in her 90s the lady with the walking frame and she goes to kerang as well and gets up and dances you know be up on their feet the other dear old soul there she 's in her 90s also but she comes along just to enjoy the music which is wonderful because that gets her out of the house and gives her a social outing i love building community so any way that i can engage people into participating in community you know like 15 16 people have come from all over the place to meet together i think that 's pretty special i 'm 71 but feel much younger than that you know i just love it [Music] i 'm 95 years old born on the 26th of october 1925 still going strong [Music] i 've been involved with the hall since we opened it about 14 years ago we 've had exercises for probably nine i 've been doing them for about seven but at the moment i 'm using it for cardiac rehab because i 've not long had a heart attack i don 't come from the best line of genes in the country heart disease and i 've got fairly advanced osteoporosis but i 've been going four and a half years since i had a quadruple bypass so it 's really important to me to get fit and stay fit for today for water aerobics we will everyone will um hop in the pool um and they 'll probably complain it is solar heated but you know it can be a little bit refreshing it 's crazy so we 'll hop in we 'll do just a bit of a warm-up and then we 'll get some dumbbells out and we 'll do some exercises with them i 've given modifications as well so we can adjust it for any fitness level you can do exercise in the water that you would struggle with if you 're out of the water i think to myself before i leave home i thought i really can 't_''_850.079 be bothered but then have a laugh together great bunch of people that come along it 's just good to be connected i mean it 's good to see we look forward to the wednesdays it 's a highlight of the week because there 's not a lot of highlights in 's the social hub of the town other than the hotel it 's not just about exercise it 's about bringing people together building that stronger community um so and it 's a huge aspect like we we 're there through the good times and the bad times and we support each other through that so it 's a huge huge importance when i finish the class i feel so fit and so healthy i just feel like i could work walk on the clouds it 's really great we 're on a hobby farm so i need to be as fit as i can be and maintain fitness i 've had hip replacements so mobility and keeping on my legs is paramount yes [Music] the old story move it or lose it is is an absolute truth and we know that because we lost our dad through his lack of movement in the end so um yeah pretty important to the whole family to to move around like that yeah i know what the gap is as far as aboriginal people and their health and mainstream people we need exercise is part of it we kind of want to pay attention to pain and conditions that exist especially in aboriginal and torres strait islander people but also realize that our mother empowered enough to be able to push through some of those types of things and and probably even more than that some of the conditions that we 've had in here typically cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and in some instances cancers it 's been amazing to see the confidence level and the capacity level of our elders coming through still sticking to the program doing great feeling as good as they ever have as a result of starting something as simple as just working through the drawing here with harm what 's wrong with me i 've lose my balance with my legs and that and i noticed now that i 've built up my muscles in my in my knees and i didn 't even have confidence to drive a car even around town but um now i 'm back in the in the car driving i was in a bit of trouble see i 've got bones so yeah and that 's what i found really hard my back 's not aching as much anymore i think the biggest thing that jackson i 've probably noticed is the activities of daily living have clearly improved and the people that are starting to get a little bit further into their program so their their ability to not just be able to walk around more freely climb stairs get up and down from the chair has been pretty phenomenal you can see those types of differences and how people get around and i think that 's where it 's really shined through as our elders and our and our mentors and you know it 's it 's vitally important that they get out and take part in these programs then we 'll alert more seem to have more energy to do things it 's about the legacy left behind for the future generations and you know and even the people in here today you know they 're leaving legacy 's not only for their direct family but community and broader communities out you know you can 't do [Music] in today 's society i think we all wish to stay out of aged care so therefore it 's very important and mentally it 's very important to keep your mind fit and active but i love working with older adults i love to get them active it 's just so wonderful so the programs that i run for move it we call it beyond the front step is pilates at the leisure center swimming program also indoors at the leisure center and the indoor pool and the older adult exercise class which is at neighborhood house i 'm 87 and 8 months old i keep coming back because i enjoy it and enjoy meeting the people here and it is helping me a lot with my health about 13 years ago i was struck down with gillian barrett i was paralyzed and i think through that i realized that you know you 've got to use all your muscles every day to keep things maintaining and yeah i originally came to want to try and lose a bit of weight especially working with dietitians and the physio to this exercise down in so to come along here and give it a go and there 's lots of opportunities if you wish to go out well i think we all feel um nervous if we haven 't done something before it 's new can we do it are we going to look silly all of these sorts of things and really you know if you can laugh at yourself you can you can get by and and it 's good and we all do that we laugh at each other and have a good time and then have a social cup of tea after and it 's great [Music] do [Music] you _"

'm gentled in the mayor city of greater bendigo um i 'd like to welcome you to the bendigo business forum and first of all acknowledge that the city of greater bendigo is on jajarung and tangaran country acknowledging and extending appreciation to the jaja rung people the traditional owners of the land that we 're meeting on and today pay our respects to leaders and elders past present and emerging for they hold the memories the traditions the culture and the hopes of all ja ja rung people we express our gratitude in the sharing of this land our sorrow for the personal spiritual and cultural costs of that sharing and our hope that we may walk forward together in harmony harmony and in the spirit of healing as we move forwards towards the end of our second year of covert we have high vaccination rates in bendigo the first facts dose and um over 80 second dose so well done everybody however it comes as we 're in the midst of a covert outbreak in bendigo and at the same time as the border with melbourne is about to be relaxed so um it 's an ever-evolving landscape and set of circumstances and regulations and especially considerations for business and there 's a bit to discuss so i 'm going to hand over to chair of b bendigo marika mcmahon for the evening thank you marika thanks jen and welcome everyone um jen if i can join with you in acknowledging our traditional owners as well and if i can also welcome everyone to this forum which has been put on this evening on relatively short notice so that um you the and us the business people of bendigo can hear from some of the experts in our area regarding the current covert situation what we might face in the future and some expert advice around though the roadmap and the steps that we need to take i 'm sure you 're in exactly the same position that regulations looking at exposure sites and always trying to think how do we look after our clients our customers and our staff so terrific that we 've been able to pull together this group of people this evening to not only give us a little bit of an explanation but also to take questions as the evening progresses format we 're only going to take up an hour of your time this evening but hopefully be able to disseminate some really useful information we have three speakers um who will be giving short presentations of about 10 minutes each then at the conclusion of that we 'll have some open question opportunity for questions as well during the course of the presentations you are able to put questions in the chat box down the bottom on your screens i don 't know why i 'm saying that we 're all probably used to zoom by now questions popped down there there are some staff from the organizations who 'll be turning to answering those questions while presentations are continuing if it 's something that can be answered quite specifically other conclusion of tonight 's discussion for people to raise specific questions so that we can manage the logistics of this with 61 participants currently in the room at the moment and probably more increasing just ask that you do keep your microphone on mute during the presentations if you 've got a question during the question presentation as daniel has already done so pop that in the chat box and we might be able to address that specifically otherwise questions taken at the end and i 'll be doing that on the basis of you know raising your hands through zoom will be the way to do that and i suspect a lot of our questions and queries will be the same so hopefully they 'll be addressed in the presentation and if not there 'll be some common themes towards the end um hopefully we 've covered off on that but really tonight 's an opportunity for business in bendigo to ask questions from the people who have the experience and qualifications to be able to answer them so that we can all get on with our business and businesses as well so my the first presenter this evening is dr bruce bollum bruce is the director of the loddon health unit um bruce is right there in the center of um bendigo 's response to covert so bruce is going to take us through the current situation for bendigo hopefully it 'll mean that we can explode a few myths but at least have a straight um from the public health bruce your direct in explanation of where bendigo is now and what we 'll be facing in the weeks and months to come so over to you bruce thanks marie so i 'll uh share my screen with you now that 's just going to take me a moment to bring up can people see that all together i hope so i 'm going to step you through a little bit of the detail of what 's happening but before i do so i 'd like to thank everybody on the call firstly for participating tonight and all the great work that 's been happening so far in our community i 'd also like to acknowledge the in our various locations and um acknowledge also aboriginal elders of the past present and emerging and the fact that aboriginal community here in bendigo have been playing leading role of course for many many many years but particularly during this last kobit period in supporting community engaging with community and keeping ourselves safe so um currently within bendigo we have seen a significant increase in cases we currently have um are since the beginning of this month and as of um last as i was 20 new four new cases yesterday a total of 256 active cases currently within the greater bendigo local government area sorry 256 cases today and then 218 active cases currently um the reason we say active cases is of course as people go through their quarantine period and they they end that period obviously they stop being an active case um we currently are seeing also in that graph what you 'll see there is the blue is the number of new cases that have happened each day the green is the number of new households as outbreaks go along as they move along a case um often what happens is that the immediate household um people are the closest contacts they often turn into cases themselves because of that close contact as as outbreaks progress broadly we normally see the number of new households start to decline as you can see from this graph there you can see we 're still getting a pretty large number of new households um within this so we would anticipate seeing new cases continuing to come through in bendigo you know for some days possibly for some weeks um we know that obviously we 're moving away from a situation of attempting to eliminate covert entirely in our community that 's no longer our goal our goal now is to try and keep it as low as it can be while allowing people the maximum freedom to practice their everyday lives and of course their business practices um as much as we can while keeping it very very low in the community as far as we can do moving to the breakdown of the cases themselves this is a chart showing the male and female males in orange color there by age group and what you can see is because of the success of our vaccine program and the mayor was just mentioning over 95 total vaccination coverage for um at least one dose in the over 16s and 80 for that same cohort what we can see is that there 's a very small number of cases in the over 60s currently or indeed in the over 50s the vast majority of cases we 're seeing in the outbreak to date are in the under 40s category of course that is the group where our vaccination levels overall are the lowest and the reason for that is that these cohorts have had the least length of time to get vaccinated these are the groups where vaccination is comparatively new relative to the over 50s and over 60s so continuing to push through our vaccinations and we 're doing roughly a thousand a day vaccinations just through our mollison street site for bendigo health let alone through general practice and pharma pharmacies throughout throughout greater bendigo we 've still got a lot of vaccines to deliver to particularly for those younger cohorts the good news here is that there is a significantly lower lower risk a lower level of severe disease in younger cohorts so broadly it is um it gets um really the severity of hospitalization and of risk of fatality is in the vast main concentrated in that over 60s group particularly when there is pre-existing illness so keeping those numbers as low as they are in the over 60s is a definite boon at this point we are seeing a large number of cases compared to what we 've seen in the past but we know that over time covet is going to be an endemic disease and as long as it remains in that under 40s group i think we can take a lot of comfort from the fact that in the vast main those cases will be mild to moderate and while we do of course have a hospital in the home program and we monitor those people who do have pre-existing medical conditions and so forth to ensure they keep safe in the vast main that should keep a lot of cases by postcode we can see this is a map of greater bendigo by postcode and the color indicates that what you can see there is a very broadly widespread distribution geographically across greater bendigo um vast the vast majority of areas within the largely urban areas have got cases and in particular we see a light a higher number of cases in kennington kangaroo flat and golden square but when we look at those areas yes they are relatively high here but the case numbers themselves are still comparatively low we 're talking 20 30 cases so rather than you know 50s and hundreds of cases so there 's a little bit of variation there but broadly this just shows that um we 've got a fairly widespread distribution of um of the current in current new cases in conclusion i 'd just like to kind of tilt into also exposure sites and this of course becomes very important for business in particular so we 've identified currently over 850 close contacts we call them primary closed contacts as a technical jargon associated with this outbreak today 850 different likelihood of having been directly exposed to the virus every single one of those when we do the interviews generates exposure sites it generates a list of contacts and a list of places that potentially there could have been exposure and currently we 've got 22 exposure sites just to give a sense of the range that we 're talking about we 've got 14 in educational settings everything from early learning and upwards 12 in retail settings including gyms and supermarkets and many other services seven in healthcare aged care or residential care and six in hospitality settings such as cafes pubs and hotels so as we all know we 're not as routine now publishing um via the dh the department of health website every single exposure site that we identify um we 've shifted into an approach here where we 're working with businesses we 're working with all of those different industries to identify cases and identify their contacts as rapidly as possible if there is a significant risk to that there is a lot of people who may have been exposed who otherwise we wouldn published on the department of health website but with the great work that 's been happening in businesses right the way across bendigo we 're really comfortable with the fact that people are keeping good records they 're doing qr code scanning and that if we need to do additional follow-up activities we can do that in partnerships between obviously the the contact traces in the team that we have at the public health unit here at bendigo health and with the businesses concerned so we 're not routinely publishing those not that they 're basically because we we 're seeing that as much more business as usual now and we 're really just reserving that publication when we think there is a significant unmitigated risk to public health that we need to prompt public awareness around to conclude as well i mean i think firstly you know it 's important to recognize just how tough it 's been for business not just of course because of the closures but the complexity of the rules and the changing nature of the rules make it very difficult for businesses and we that that puts business owners under the good news is that those rules should over time gradually get easier and simply simpler to implement as we get uh into a more covid normal way of working the bad news is more change and constant change unfortunately will continue for some time and a return to full you know normal at least isn 't uh here for you know i would i would say my professional opinion at least for a couple of years yet things like mass wearing in certain circumstances hand hygiene keeping physical distancing going in certain circumstances those things are going to be here with us for quite some time so i 'm kind of on behalf of public health i thank you for your efforts so far and i apologize for the inconvenience to your businesses in these changing rules but to indicate some of the positive changes that i think are happening i will dwell on some of the more significant changes that have happened before we go on to other speakers in particular changes to quarantine requirements which mean that now fully vaccinated people don 't live with the case now don 't have to quarantine for two weeks that 's been reduced to seven days and they can be reduced following a negative basis test now what that means is less furloughing of staff we hope it means less people being kept out of the community and participating in everyday business activities also for close contacts living with a positive case we only need them to qual to quarantine for 14 days and they don 't have to have their quarantine extended should anyone else in the household become positive this is this issue of we 've had often in households as the as the infection spreads guess rolling quarantine requirements and that can have a really significant effect on furloughing of staff so this shift of the rules again is public health uh defensible but it also makes our business a lot more predictable we hope um in terms of furloughing of staff particularly and finally household secondary contacts those are people who 've been in casual contact um are no longer needing to be quarantined so if someone 's been to that household who haven 't been there no longer need to quarantine in the same way as they have previously so while changes will be occurring we hope that the changes that will occur in the main will mean a less onerous impact on business certainly that is our intent and we work very closely with our department of health colleagues and everyone else from dj pr onwards um to try and make this as easy as possible recognizing how challenging it has been and will be for some time for bendigo businesses um so that 's it from me i thank you thank you so much bruce i i don 't know we 'll hear from others later but i certainly really appreciated hearing that directly from you that just a little bit of a sense of relief whilst it 's not necessarily an easy path forward at least there 's a path forward and it 's really comforting to know the expert epidemiological etc approach regarding what how should we be thinking about this current case level one little measure that uh the public health unit might not 20 months i 've kept a keen eye on the number of cars parking in queen street and i 'm pleased to say that today i had to drive up to the car park to get a park the uh car parks are starting to fill up on street level which i think is a nice little measure for bendigo our next speaker today is barbara cullen barbara is and excuse me this is a long title the director industry sector engagement from the department of jobs precincts and regions and barbara 's going to talk to us about the roadmap business settings covert safe plans and support available for businesses so barbara welcome to our discussion today and over to you particularly keen to hear things from the department perspective thank you so much marika and it 's lovely to be here in beautiful indigo one of my i 've got family in the area too so i don 't think they 're here i 'd like to start by respectfully acknowledging the traditional owners of the lander which we 're virtually meeting today and i pay my respects elders of other communities who may be here today um roadmap we 've had lots of announcements as bruce has said lots of information to keep up to date with um at on friday at six o 'clock um we 'll be moving to a new statewide setting where regional victoria and metropolitan melbourne joins together again finally um and that 's what 's called phase c in the national plan on the roadmap to delivering victoria 's part of the national plan as we know the settings will will ease including density and capacity limits on premises if your staff if your you and your staff are fully vaccinated and your customers or clients are fully vaccinated vaccinated as well masks will remain mandatory indoors but we no longer require them outdoors you pee masks are highly recommended where people can 't keep that distance from each other and every business as we know must have a covert safe plan please keep it up to date every time you hear of an announcement or a change to directions please pull out the covert safe plan have a look and directions changes affect your business talk to your local council talk to your business advisors talk to your industry groups and be bendigo especially to see if there 's any information that needs to be updated in your covert safe plan update it and talk about it with your staff and i might talk about that later as well thanks fran so from friday at six o 'clock most indoor settings including restaurants pubs gyms and hairdressers will open with one person per four square meters and only if all the staff and all your customers or patrons are fully vaccinated most outdoor settings will be at one person per two square meters up to 500 people clients customers customers like this if they 're outside patrons where staff and patrons are fully vaccinated we had some really good news today from the department of health that clarified the setting and the requirements for general retail and that is that customers attending general retail there 's an example there of a clothing shop or essential retail for instance a supermarket will not be required to show proof of being fully know what 's down the future path but at this stage from uh friday evening you will not have to show proof of being of being fully vaccinated to enter retail and on the um on the website and there 's a link that we can provide later if not in the presentation that actually tells you what general retail includes for this purpose it doesn 't include hairdressing or personal care services or beauty workers in general retail and essential retail are required to be vaccinated by the dates that were specified in the mandatory vaccination directions and there 's the full name of it and that 's the 26th of november so it 's really great that we got this clarification today because i know that people um uh preparing to open on these particular levels and these particular density quotients from friday evening and it was a really vital piece of information that we needed because otherwise you would have had to accommodate someone doing that checking but for now we don 't thanks fran there 's lots of new posters available for you to help you status change of color on the posters you might notice that it 's a like a dark blue um or a black and it 's a it 's a big shift from the kind of aquary green that 's currently around these are posters that help you and this is one of the guidance pieces that helps you understand the types or you and your staff help you understand the type of information that you might be presented with to verify someone 's vaccination status and fran has put some put the link in the chat there as well for everyone which is the link to the resources that 's online thanks friend and there 's also in the posters the steps and in the guidance the steps to help you download the proof of um vaccination status and it 's linked to your um my gov oh not my cup what am i saying my victoria um service victoria app what and uh you get a very nice um little moving uh um coat of arms uh and you also get the multi-colored um v for victoria uh as you need to go through to create that account and make sure that you 've connected your certificate from your double vaccination to your service victoria app and your check-in your qr code check-in thanks brian as bruce talked about there 's a great new approach to close contacts if it works in the workplace this is really really welcome news as well it does really help those businesses with shifts to accommodate shifts and people where they maybe have been exposed so this is a really much more practical approach we think and there 's lots of information on on the website and it is a risk break based approach and there 's a matrix that you can look at to determine as well and help you make those determinations about whether someone is a close contact like a first contact or a secondary contact and it does help with that um uh keeping the roster a little bit more flexible for you especially when you take into account you might not have um fully vaccinated stuff that you 're trying to accommodate as well in some other part working from home not from um the work site uh it talks about um and as bruce said the primary close contact required to isolate for only seven days if they 're fully vaccinated so another another incentive to be fully vaccinated as soon as possible household and unvaccinated primary close contacts is still required to um isolate for 14 days and there 's more information on the business victoria hotline or the coronavirus.vic.gov.eu website thanks fran lots of information here for you posters the roadmap the links to the roadmap and as we 've found that the roadmap gets updated whenever there are questions friend we could go back to the other links or the great ocean road if you like um [Music] i guess that 's it thanks um okay that 's okay um what we 'll do is we will i will send the presentation to um oh here we are we 're back um to uh to rachel and uh colleagues so that they can share you this presentation and you 've got those links to click through as well there is a link there to was an announcement a couple of weeks ago by minister pulford uh who announced the new package of business support that 's available mainly a lot of top-up grants for people under the funds and there 's a new video on how to add the vaccination certificate to your service victoria app i 'm not sure if the links are actually live there but i 'm friend before i send that i 'll make sure that they are and certainly lots of information on um [Music] having conversations with your staff about getting vaccinated if um if that 's something that you need to do and i must recommend that the department of health has put together a fantastic champions program uh to help you have discussions and to answer questions about vaccination and there 's a video that i 'll pop in the link as well that is one of the it 's a recording of one of the webinars where i think it 's bruce cowy bruce kelly ben cowy um professor cowie is answering the questions um all the questions about getting vaccinated so that 's always believe also that the um i think fairly recently it might be just from today that the service victoria app where you have your your check-in your qr code check-in and your your vaccination certificate it 's also now it 's updating to include a new feature that notifies victorians who have the app the cover qr code checking app that they have checked in at a tier one exposure site listed on the coronavirus website so that 's a fantastic new feature of the service victoria app so that 's another reason to download that app and use it to help with the contact tracing and to minimize the spread of the virus and i think that 's all for me but very happy to take questions terrific thanks bob we will take those questions at the end our third speaker um so just i know we have some people who had joined us a little bit into the presentation what we 're doing is having the three speakers and then the opportunity for some questions there are people popping questions in the chat at the moment which we themes of questions together for the discussion at the conclusion our third speaker this evening is sue tomlinson also from the public health unit at the loddon mallee public health unit and soos rolls largely around the contact tracing and the activation of the unit regarding cases and sue 's going to talk to us about the current processes for business when a positive case is known so thank you sue thank you very much marika i 'm hoping you can hear me i tried to turn the camera on but it 's having a little hissy fit so apologies for that but you can 't see me uh no problem sue the the sound 's coming through fine thanks excellent thank you um yeah we 've done a few changes in the um workplace exposure space but primarily from a contact tracing perspective it is very similar to how we 've been doing it all year so we get notified of a case once we 've done that we would interview that case we 'd find out where they worked or where they attended anything that we considered high more recently in that as bruce mentioned we 're not necessarily identifying tier 2 exposure sites anymore so we do a bit of an assessment with the case themselves to see how long they were in a space whether they were wearing a mask sort of how close they were to people how big the space is and we make a decision um about whether or not we move forward in contacting that business so then we would find out your number or you can almost guarantee it 'll be an after hours number request if it doesn 't happen on saturday it never happens at all as far as i can tell um but we chase around looking uh for that if it 's not obvious and uh we 'll give the manager or the supervisor whoever 's number is available a call and we sort of start the process and it basically starts with a hi you know really sorry to have to tell you that you 've had a covert case visit your establishment or that you 've got a staff member that works there the general a staff member we obviously require to identify the staff member we do that for public health reasons because it would be very difficult for you to do any contact tracing if you didn 't know who the positive case was when it 's a customer it 's a little more difficult and there 's it just depends on how easy or hard that is to do that identification so it might just come down to times and dates for determining when the customer was in the site and trying to identify from a business perspective the contact tracing so the one thing that is good recently um with that is they 've developed a matrix which we now have access to that with the contact tracing helps you determine who 's at high risk who 's at low risk and who 's at medium risk and it means that instead of previously just about everybody that was in the area would isolate for 14 days and now that we 've got this matrix we 're able to risk assess against the people in the room or in the space they were wearing a mask how close they were to the case so obviously that social distancing conversation about within 1.5 or outside 1.5 meters whether you had physical um contact um and how big the space is and how long uh people were in the space so if you 're sitting in an office that 's not very big not well ventilated and you 're in there for an hour um you may end up as a high risk even though you haven 't actually come you know within 1.5 meters having said that the high risk and the medium risk and the low risk does change on your vaccination status so that piece just sits in the background so once we determine the type of contact then we can add the vaccination status in and that might reduce the risk to the people as well so we walk through that sort of process we provide the matrix if you require it um and we determine that i think the other thing that we often do and certainly is the question is do you need to close so the perspective so what the expectation is is if the person that is positive was in a particular space and you 're able to close that off and clean it then you can close that area off do a cobra 19 clean and you can keep the rest of the business open if it 's been over 72 hours since the case last attended again you can as long as you have daily high touch cleans in traffic areas and you have ability to do high touch cleans in that space again you don 't need to and then the third one i 'm just looking for where i 've written down the third one um as if you do daily routine um cleaning of high touch areas in your traffic areas and that 's where they 've been but those sorts of things are all on the website and you just have to have a look at those when you go i don 't know if people have seen it i 'm not sure whether we can put the link in but on the exposure sites website right down the the map and don 't go further is the tier one um business information and that 's where the cleaning is and it explains it much better than i probably am over the um zoom meeting tonight um but i think that it 's a good thing to note that it is no longer an automatic closure so if you can get around it then that 's a good thing we will ask for the contact tracing list and that 's so that we can then place people into our system we can provide them with whatever their support might be whether that 's once they get into our system we get sms 's we can then um refer them to the financial assistance if they don 't if they 're not in our system then it 's very difficult for them to access those they require reference numbers and things like that and it also means that we can keep an eye on clearances and provide them with those that information as we go through for contact so we will ask and we usually send an excel spreadsheet and what we need is the name first name and second name date of birth a phone number preferably their mobile if they 've got one and then the last day of exposure and that becomes a issue if you 've got um a staff member that 's worked perhaps for three days you 'll find that somebody worked with them on wednesday but didn 't work with them on thursday or friday other people work with them on friday so you may find that when you 're doing that contact chasing that the last day of exposure is a little different depending on who 's worked when um but we do do that because they 're 14 days start or their seven depending on vaccination status um starts when they 've had their last contact so i think primarily that 's how it goes if you do close you no longer have to provide a certificate of cleaning to open you just have to abide by the code 19 cleaning information which will be in most of your code plans anyway i expect i think the other thing i 'd when cases um uh diagnosed on their testing they actually receive a text message from the pathology so what we 're finding now is that staff members ring their business or regular patrons will tell the business or the area that they have been in that they 're a case and you start to look around and wonder what nurse you 're supposed to do next because nobody from the department has contacted you that yet and that 's because actually we don 't necessarily know right at that minute um so there 's that little lag time now that the um cases are getting an sms where they 're aware of it they may well be telling people which is not you know perfectly reasonable and as a business you may well know um that you are you have somebody in your workplace that 's positive so all i can say is the best thing to do there 's two options one is obviously read the tier one guideline for business at the bottom of the exposure site page and just work your way through knowing that we will the client and worked out where they work and do the risk assessment the other is that you can reach out to the public health unit and it 's just depending on the timing and and the information that you have um it 's a little bit hard to be 100 sure exactly how that will work because as i said sometimes you can get notified um informally and sometimes you get notified formally so i think that covers the vast majority of stuff thank you marika terrific thanks very much sue and i think if we put that information together with bruce 's information i think a key message for bendigo businesses is you know we have had a nice little bubble for a lot of the the covert journey but now that we do have the high vaccination rates but opening up i think we are moving to a stage now where the approach of business should be it 's not if we are um affected our workplace is affected by covert a covert exposure but it 's when it happens um i 've spent a bit of and in in particular the link there on the front page of the covert exposure site where you click on my business is a tier one exposure site that link 's been shared here as well really useful exercise to spend half an hour having a look at that and thinking about it for your business it is if you prepared your um plan some time ago it 's quite different regarding closure opening um notification and um what 's involved in cleaning and i actually found it you know pretty um useful to go through and see that it is actually less onerous um and to also have that thought of having a look at it before it becomes something that you actually need to need to deal with in reality so urge all of you to have a look at that um thank you so much to our three presenters for your very efficient um delivery of your content um which now gives us the opportunity to look at some questions so while our participants are um gathering their thoughts regarding questions that they 'd like to ask in zoom to pop up a hand i 'll turn to your question but i 'll pull together a couple of the threads of things while you 're doing that that 's in the chat um obviously a big area where people have questions is around vaccinations and hospitality and in particular what are those rules in this dare i say sort of crossover time at the moment where we 've had one arrangement in regional and then that 's moving um you know we have the 6pm friday happening so um wendy had asked what if a staff member is still awaiting their second vaccination on friday but booked in for the second one does that change what they can do work-wise or does it change the density requirements for the business so i think that 's probably barb to answer that one thanks rika um yes i was actually just replying then to one of wendy 's previous questions um uh it it does um only fully vaccinated staff are able to um work on site um therefore you might find something else for that person to do bringing it forward if they can so only only fully vaccinated staff operating if you are unable to roster on any fully vaccinated staff at all then um you may have to choose to revert to a previous setting which is take away for because we are now we 're from 6 pm on friday we 'll be at metropolitan and regional victoria joined together in the one settings uh the setting is that if you cannot provide um uh staff to help in in the hospitality sector then it 's takeaway for customers uh sorry for your business only you can 't offer um partially vaccinated staff um in a fully vaccinated customer setting and so you might you will have to operate as takeaway for that duration um similarly and i think this was wendy 's other question was that if you have uh customers who are partially vaccinated or not you can 't verify their status and you 've got fully vaccinated staff so you 're operating as sit-down service indoors um and um seated indoors yes and outdoor people as well you can only offer that vaccinated customers can 't sit down at your premises because that 's the work site they need to be fully vaccinated and so takeaway services is what you offer those um people those customers with a smile so this is the this is all part of the alignment so that 's the steps under the one requirement yes um and i guess in some ways bob i imagine that that 's also aimed at trying to manage the risk of hopefully we 're going to have lots of um people visiting um but managing the risk of that yes yes that 's exactly right and i believe there is quite a big expectation that a lot of um people in metropolitan melbourne will be heading out into the regions this weekend especially um this long and longish weekend with you count that monday that mysterious monday um that there will be hopefully huge numbers of visitors in regional victoria and so that 's to help you manage that as well bob i think in the comments and i certainly know in some of the questions that we 're getting at dare i say some questions i just get in the chair at the hairdressers there 's a good deal of confusion around hairdressers at the moment which i think may have come because of um some changes around there bub can you just give us some clarification regarding who needs to be vaccinated in head hairdressers and when both in customers and staff sure very happy too and you 're lucky to have been to a hairdresser because i haven 't my appointment is not until the 4th of november and i am taking time in lieu to do it in a in hairdressing beauty salons and personal care from friday 6 p.m on friday both staff and clients will need to be fully vaccinated and these because hair salons can 't_''_2952.72 do click and collect there 's no option if you have partially vaccinated staff um unless you can do some sort of click and collect uh you can 't operate uh as a hair salon thanks bob that was that was very clear and i think that is probably the difficulty that 's been around that in some getting our head around six o 'clock friday yes is the important six o 'clock derby eve as i like to refer you to it we can we can get that through um got a question that 's popped up in the chat box from one from um one of our local restaurants pointing out um miss battams there um pointing out that currently you know the testing the waiting times on tests are very long and people waiting up to three days for test results i know sue you might be the one to answer this is it anticipate no it 's bruce are we going to look like improving on that sitting in the darkness here um i don 't know if that 's going to help maybe it 's not going to help that that 's good thanks bruce so yeah so the bottom line here is that um yeah our testing system is under a lot of stress at the moment basically because whenever we 're generating exposure sites of course that 's generating people who need testing but unfortunately a lot of people who don caught up in community conversations around issues and obviously if that 's a school for example or a business with a large number of clients that can potentially make a very large number of people who don 't necessarily have any symptoms go and want to get tested and across the state we 're doing over 70 000 tests a day um that compares to only 10 000 that we were doing a year ago or about 18 months or maybe months or so ago and we started on this journey testing wise and of course that is creating delays it is a challenge one of the key issues really to reiterate is that you only need to get tested if you 're symptomatic or if you 've been contacted so if someone from the department has directly reached out to you or obviously if you 're a business if you 're reaching out to people and saying you are a primary coast contact as far as i can tell you should go and get tested the rest of the family don 't need to get tested the siblings the house at the same time don 't need to get tested but unfortunately in some instances because everyone 's on high alert they 're wanting to do the right thing they are they are alarmed they are concerned they 're often being a bit overzealous unfortunately and it is meaning that we 've got a lot of testing challenges on our on our plate so the key message i 'd like people to take away is symptomatic testing is the top priority the next priority is wait until you 've been contacted by someone from the public health team or directly obviously by a business to say you are a person who 's potentially a risk everybody else should basically just sit and stay and wait um obviously if they 're particularly concerned they 're free to isolate at home if that 's appropriate but certainly it is creating a lot of pressure on our system currently uh within bendigo thanks bruce that 's it is something that has changed over time so that 's good to know um other thing that might be worth picking your brain on bruce considered to be the symptoms now the symptoms remain the same so basically all of those same cardinal ones of fatigue sore throat loss of sense of smell and taste all of those kind of key ones that we 've been learning out still remain the same key things to look out for basically symptomatically terrific thank you um some concern from some of our hospitality businesses in the chat bub around their responsibilities of monitoring vaccination status and particularly around takeaway customers and if i summarize the questions i think it 's a bit around um can they just manage that as part of their normal hospitality meet and greet management or do they need to have a designated covert marshal who 's taking on that role that 's a great question that 's a really good question because that 's real life and if you 're doing just take away you don 't have to ask about vaccination status you only need to do the qr code checking so remember that when you 're doing take away your your customer does need to use the qr code to qr their vaccination status for take away um at if you 're doing seated service uh you can uh you do need to check both the vaccination status and the qr code check-in that can be um one of your staff you don 't need to hire new staff or a security guard to do it unless you 're well at all i mean that 's a business decision um uh i believe security staff are hard to find at the moment too but it it you could use one of your staff to do that as you come in but it is you do need to check everybody because if you do have an authorised officer or one of the checks the one of the um worksafe or um the department of health checks who come along they will they don 't go around to each table and check all your clients or patrons they will go to the business people behind the counter and ask to see the covert safe plan and um we 'll ask you know about the checking in of the client so and they code scan in i guess no i don 't think they can actually because they can 't see that because the misspoken only to contact tracers can see that information but they will ask you about checking people 's vaccination status so um a staff member can do it and you don 't need to hire a separate person to do it but uh it does need to be done accurately so you do need to make sure that you are doing it to make sure that everybody in your premises uh is fully vaccinated who is sitting down having service complicated thanks bub just a reminder um what age do people have to be double vaccinated to attend a hospitality venue so from um from this week i think it 's from 6 p.m on friday it is uh people 12 years and over have to be fully vaccinated or if if a child is unvaccinated as in a under 12 child they do need to be accompanied by a vaccinated adult so it 's over 12. thanks bob um we 've got a few of our accommodation providers to dust off the cobwebs on their beautiful accommodation premises and look forward to um more visitors to bendigo what there 's just a little bit of confusion though around um what 's the vaccination requirements for people attending um accommodation venues if you 're able to clarify that i can do this one it it 's um very interesting we 've had a um quite some lengthy discussions with people over this because it is probably a bit confusing because it 's residential in a way while it 's being um it 's also uh a business um so for um there 's no requirement to check any person who is a tenant or a visitor as in staying um and renting from you uh it 's there 's no requirement to check their vaccination status and that is um and i 'll read out the list so that and i 'll pop the link in the chat as well um that includes camping grounds caravan parks hotels hostels bnbs private holiday rental facilities and motels and service departments which is pretty much everything isn 't it so so doesn 't need to check the vaccination status but they do need to get them to check in via the qr code on the business and um make sure that that 's done and there were some frequently asked questions that were updated on this today on the coronavirus website thanks thanks bob um if there 's any other questions don 't hesitate to pop up your hand this is an incredible opportunity to have your questions answered directly sharon from crystalline you 've popped up your hand i think you 'll just need to unmute yourself there sharon yeah thank you i love my hand as well um it was really good to hear accommodation touched on there i am um asking questions on half of the accommodation industry um bendigo obviously has a lot of motels we understand that currently there 's no requirement around vaccinations so we 're fully across that one but that does lead to the question of um i suppose responsibility to our staff obviously our staff need to be double-backed we get that but you know we have someone coming into a room see the vaccination status so at minimum we know whether it 's a higher risk room or a lower risk room uh how do we protect our staff from a pd um sorry bruce will be able to answer that with his with his understanding in terms of um you know access into the room keeping our staff safe obviously we 've got a covert safe plan in place we 're doing covert safe cleaning but it 's very concerning that we 're going to be left at the at the front line and a higher risk perhaps of exposure obviously people stay with us for a long time as well so if we do have a positive case we 've got others staying with us at the time we really want some guidance and we found that the accommodation sector seems to be lacking in information and guidance it seems to be a bit of a forgotten sector a little bit in terms of what to do and how to manage it so i 'm up i 'm happy to lead off and i think barbara might talk a to motels but as a broad public health piece if your staff are double vaxxed that 's incredibly important secondly as long as they continue to practice their overall coded safe behaviors and that could include mask wearing obviously physical distancing hand washing are really important components as well if they 're double vaccine if they 're doing that the risk to them on a personal level is going to be really very low we do know that there are a lot of infections that people get even when they 're vaccinated but when they 're vaccinated the likelihood of that being severe is extremely low in many instances it 's going to be basically for someone of a working age minimum very minimal risk particularly if they 're already double vaccinated i know that that 's not no risk but unfortunately we 're living in a kind of no we 've got no scenario where any of us are living in a no-risk environment none of the vaccines are actually 100 effective yet the the the fastest vaccines ever to be produced in human history so uh doing an so if your staff are fully vaccinated and practicing coded safe behaviors i think they are well on the road to working in a very covered safe manner but i 'll hand over to barbara for any of the specifics on the motel environment particularly thanks bruce uh i think um fran um it it was it 's i think it 's about um in your covert safe plan it is um putting in place some specific uh covert safe practices that you will do in the business as well about you might be able to do contactless food delivery to that person if you because you 're not checking anyone 's vaccination status you don 't know if anyone is unvaccinated so i think it 's about making sure that your service delivery within the the motel or the the business the accommodation business is as contactless as possible regardless of a person 's vaccination status really um and to perhaps you know put in place some business requirements about if you 're going to change a room um or something like that making sure that there 's plenty can open um you know windows and things like that um make sure you might even ask um if windows are able to be opened um ask your customers to open the windows before as they leave something like that just some just if you think through the process that um a person has to go through to um leave a premises or um be in the premises that you have to maximize your ventilation of the of the room and uh put in place those practices but um it i appreciate that it is it is difficult for accommodation but um it 's a little bit like access to food we can 't_``_3807.52 deny people access to your shelter so sorry barbara sorry i hope this is okay if i just do a quick follow-up question we 're being advised and even today during our meeting with industry leaders of aha that we 're needing to make a decision over the next few days as to whether we as an accommodation provider are going to insist on our customers being double vaxxed or not and if we make that we are a double back center and that 's what we 're choosing to do i 'm getting the sense from you that you 'd almost suggest that 's not an appropriate process no not at all no it 's a business decision ultimately it is absolutely your right to make rules about who comes into your business okay because i suppose the other concern is that that transfer of a um you know someone who has been vaccinated someone who hasn 't been and if the staff member goes through the rooms are we making someone who 's perhaps medically unable to get a vaccine higher risk because we 're allowing unvaccinated guests to stay in nearby rooms yeah it ultimately it is your decision about what sure um who comes in to your business and that goes through any business so okay thank you i will also just i 'll jump in here i 'll share a quick slide we are looking to run some um business forums in the coming couple of weeks which are specific for industries bob will be um in attendance um but we to your business i 've popped a slide up there about some of the dates that list will grow for other industries as well as we touch on them um and i 'll pop the details into the chat as well but i do encourage you to register and and come along um that might help with some of the more granular questions that are specific uh to you um we understand that forums like this can be a bit um uh convoluted trying to to pick out the information so yeah we 'll be looking to run those in the next couple of weeks thanks fran i forgot to do the promotion thank you hopefully we haven 't been too convoluted no it 's just very complex i know it 's so complex isn 't it when you 're a retail visit or some port i 'm sure there 's some poor real estate agent sitting back there going i don 't understand so yeah please do reach out to us um that icc email is also on that slide pack from barb as well so we can answer at time i do see a couple of other questions that i think would be of interest to most people in the chat and i think there 's a little bit of confusion around the obligation of an employer to be able to provide the information of who was in the workplace on a date of exposure as sue mentioned that is some of the information that the contact tracers would be making in order to make their determinations about who 's a close personal contact but i think that 's a little bit confusing when you then have the qr codes as well barb and suham i write that the expectation is that an employer is not getting that information from qr codes they 'd be requesting their staff to use the qr codes because that would help the contact traces but it 's a separate obligation of an employer to provide a list of who was working that day that 's right marika if there 's a um sort of a traced uh transmission in the workplace that um yes that will be that list will be uh in on the qr code app as like a as they come in the door every day yeah bob i know with with mine i 'll um check in on the qr code if i 'm you know on those rare occasions on one of the ten in the office we 'll be glad to see that gone come friday um but the um i i generally check back make sure i 'm checking in the office partly because i think and so i might be wrong with my amateur contact tracing but i think that 's could be really useful if i 'd you know the coffee shop i 'd just been to was an exposure site that there would then be that chain that i can say oh no i left that at that time because i 'd checked back into the office at this time so sometimes that story and don 't you love going back through your history of your qr codes to see where you 've been that story i i imagine would be really useful to sue and her team in the contact trace public holiday i must thank you all for taking this time to meet and hear of these things um and hopefully that 's provided some information that is useful for your business um there 's a number of resources that you can turn to if you are finding navigating these things difficult or that there 's particular instances that are a little bit hard to figure out for your particular business setup this evening was organized by our local regional development victoria and the icc email is in that chat but as an easy point of contact if you did have any questions or wanted to be put in touch with the right people in the department certainly reach out to b bendigo and we 'll be able to assist you with that um city of greater bendigo are also able to assist particularly just um through their business assistance but probably bendigo would be an easy way to look at that as well um i know we 've got councillor general as mayor and councillor margot o 'rourke_''_4166.48 on the line councillors are often good people to point you 's all about also being in it together and so certainly having a chat through your um different industry is often useful as well can i also um this is none of this is easy for all of us to navigate um don 't forget that be bendigo also has the wonderful xiaomi providing counselling and other mental health support if you or your staff members are finding this difficult um certainly reaching out to shami who can either provide support directly or refer you onto appropriate services is really worthwhile doing and keep an eye on the be bendigo newsletters as well xiaomi 's got a great presentation coming up soon about dealing with challenging customers which if you or your staff are worried about the potential of aggravation around some of these issues that 's a great session to tune into as well but xiaomi is also available to provide bespoke um presentations or discussions with your individual staff or perhaps your um you know a collection of businesses in your geographical or industry area as well so hopefully for those who have a public holiday tomorrow please a break from all of this i think uh bruce can reassure us that we don 't need to watch the numbers too closely tomorrow and um sue will get in touch with us if we 're an exposure site so please take a break from this pressure if you are working tomorrow i hope it 's a good business day for you um and otherwise i look forward to seeing you at future be bendigo events and to assisting you and your business because i 'm really looking forward to an exciting and positive time for business in bendigo going forward thank you and thank you to our presenters as well thanks market pleasure and b bendigo is a fantastic organisation you _"

    "text": "greater bendigo is a very special place for young people to live because it provides us with many opportunities we have the tafe and la trobe university um and our educational institutions can work closely hand in hand um with those organizations but we 're also an extremely culturally diverse community and i think that prepares us very well for future life and our endeavors i think something that would make bendigo better for young people would be more activities for us to do when we 're hanging out with our friends we 've got a lot of family friendly facilities and places to hang out but not so much for young people or teenagers i don 't know i think we need to have a team that works on it and brainstorms what that could look like because we have places like the cinema at the moment but once you 've gone there with your friends it can be quite expensive especially if you continue doing that a lot so something that 's sort of important i think currently mental health specifically as a result of covet as well think we 're going to need to work a lot with young people to ensure resilience and yeah healthy mental health going into the future what impact i think isolation especially because of kovid also stress in school especially in year 12 we all feel the need and desire to push ourselves further and further as our society grows and we 've we just want to be ahead in running with that but sometimes that takes a lot of energy and a large toll on young people i think from within ourselves not necessarily parents or society but just a deep desire to always be working with the community and running along as fast as we can and it 's healthy because well in most circumstances because we grow and we change and adapt to situations and become more resilient but at the same time it can also provide burnout and yeah definitely a large source of stress i think particularly if we were talking about covert 19 i think we need to have more accessible counselling and therapy for youth who have been traumatized by it but i also to deal with stress as well more widely um and remove the taboo from that sort of thing as well do you think this i think definitely prioritizing an approach to improving the mental health of students as i was speaking about before creating more spaces for youth and teenagers to hang out and commune with people and gather together number three i think also providing a space for young emerging creative artists to thrive and to learn we already have an amazing performing and creative arts scene for young people but we can always improve and i think that would be really cool as well so what makes greater bendigo a great place for young people to live now well it 's such a community like a lot of people know each other and it 's like just really welcoming and you 've got like such nice people like i 've got such great friends that i 've met so many new friends here today and i 've met so many friends along the way in different activities outside of school as well so it 's just really friendly targeting age groups are like specifically my age group because i feel as if there are a lot of family places you can go to um with you know as families and you know as there 's a few clubs out that people over the age of 18 can go to but there 's not much through the ages of 13 and 17. so maybe just a few more activities and some places like that for our age group um i think i think a challenge could be you know just getting out and doing stuff a lot of people don 't go out as much as often and if they do they don 't do that much they 'll go out for lunch and they 'll go home and watch a movie whereas i think you know you should stay in town and you know have a bit of fun with friends and family and stuff well i think we need to create activities um which is why it 's such a good idea to have a youth panel to get different ideas to see what people want of who 's 12 and she wants an aquarium and then a boy who 's 17 he wants like a skate park to hang out with his friends so there 's completely different options so you know just get a range of ideas and you know try your best to do it as i mentioned before targeting different age groups safety i think that 's very very important and also like welcoming people that aren 't australians into the community and teaching them our language and our culture and everything about us um well i guess we 've just over the years you 've heard stories and you know people can sometimes give off these certain i guess it 's just the perspective you see things um you know just are there places that you feel unsafe well some places like at night um you know if you can 't really stay past late because some people tend to have a few drinks and go out so you know you can 't stay out late but just stuff like that you know i really like the inclusive environment that it fosters see them out on the streets from all walks of life that 's really cool i see it from a mix like so many people move into bendigo and they 're so diverse and younger people are also really diverse in that sense as well um i think having more places for the youth group to hang out or more youth activities would be really beneficial towards a younger population just because when friends come over or we have people come over from other towns we don 't really have much to do around bendigo right now i think just great hangout areas or new places for new youth groups or activities that we might find cool or just like chill out zones that 'd be really cool after schools or something cool i think after covid and lockdown everything most of us had a lot of mental health issues and since a lot of people weren 't educated about that or they didn 't have any have much mental health awareness it was really hard for us to cope with these sort of things and i just think increasing so that we have some people to talk to and everything i just think mental health accessibility would need to be improved a little more because right now with psychology centers and everything there 's probably like a max a minimum of a one-year weight because of the availability of good trained specialists and everything so i think just increasing a little more accessibility would be really beneficial to young people i 'd probably say just like just being more inclusive towards the young community because we feel kind of detached like we don 't know much about the older community and we don 't know how to interact with everyone so i think just you know bringing the community together would be really really beneficial and it would foster a sense of belonging and welcome and like a welcoming environment probably kindness um inclusivity and equity matura bendigo what 's good are you getting getting grandma unicorn do you wear um like red and bluish yeah um it 's a very vibrant community and there 's lots of opportunities for everyone to sort of use yeah well if you feel like taking so there 's like tafe for people who um don 't want to go to uni but like want to stay in bendigo and study stuff there and there 's like different groups where you that you can join like art and drama and basketball and all that so yeah um probably more activities for the youth so things that they can do without for them outside of school so like i don 't know like if they want to meet people and do art or sport or something like that for them without having um the older generation being there um probably having a say so like they 're not listened to as much as what the um what older like parents and stuff say so yeah um asking them and just listening to what they have to say and what their ideas are even just like a survey online asking them what like so they don 't have to come out here but like also in types of situations like this leisure activities for youth um diversity inclusiveness and honesty my name is charlotte what where do you live i live in eagle hawk so much diversity so many cultures in the area um it 's very inclusive and what better place to be than bendigo with all that culture and all that it 's stuff to learn about everything like um their food their language everything um just how unique and different it is from the stuff that i 'm used to because i remember um we had this aboriginal dance group come to my school and um their dance style was completely different from when i was what i 'd known and this was really and i had really fun trying it out and trying different it moves that were dedicated to aboriginals and their culture so that yeah that was really cool for young people lots of places to hang out uh um there 's the marketplace the hargraves mall or um rosalind park lots of places to socialize and be with around people more accessible mental health because a lot of teenagers nowadays are struggling with every sort of a mental health issue you could think of like depression anxiety all more ex if bendigo can make it extremely more accessible so everyone can um get the help that they need without being on like a waiting list or something that would be a big help for the young people um have like um the weekly or monthly like groups um so that way not only that they that the young kids and teenagers get to like meet other people that have similar problems to them they can relate to and on that certain level and um be able to talk and get advice from their fellow uh community peers in that um at the moment after covert and everything um definitely employment um because um we 're also competing against adults too for like for casual job part-time job stuff and um we 're not getting anywhere um because is um they people from my experience um people would want an adult with more experience in that certain field that they are hiring for and with a teenager they think uh they 're not ready for this and that sort of thing so i think it 'd be a big have like um groups at school or have something to teach kids on how to um sort out their resumes applied for jobs go for interviews and um they have like groups and um the places um in bendigo to help with um the unemployment so if you go into this place something like access employment um they can help with um finding places that are looking for um junior or part-time employment and that that way they get the right because apparently um the percentage of um the unemployment in youth is like 50 61 or something um it 's quite bad so the more we could do like programs and stuff that would be really helpful top priority would be youth unemployment next would be mental health although switch them around they 're both really important and the last one would be more social interactions because most teenagers would rather set aside and not like interact with anyone or have not much um social skills so especially with people with disabilities and stuff so it 'd be really helpful for those type of people to branch out and mixed um i wouldn 't abilities people um so um we 've got like adhd people autism like mix everything everyone in the mix like a giant social group for teenagers and youth people but not only that if the others will know what it 's like living in with a disability and also who um they 'll have get to meet new people make new friends outside of their own school and that at talking to strangers you 're not like sitting back and observing you 're just getting right into it introduce yourself hi i 'm alexander i 'm 15 and i live here in bendigo awesome what 's good um net school it 's a part of um secondary senior yeah awesome where are you i 'm 10. what do you think makes greater beneco a great place for young people to live in now the amount of space we have parks like roslyn park we 've got so much area and so much nature that we can just explore and go out and say people with photography you 've got so much to look at what with people with disabilities teenagers there 's not many options apart from the male marketplace around the streets where there 's not very private and selective areas for more teenager ages what um on the back of that where would you like to go what activities would you like to have in those facilities there are so many people like they got rid of the um ice skating rink i know so many people that would love to learn or say maybe some art classes or just some private events just so kids can go out and interact and find people that they 're most compatible with and what do you think is the greatest challenge for young people mental health issues during the 21st century majority of teenagers suffer with other anxiety or depression and it 's a massive struggle have you seen that more or less in the last year two years definitely with covid since everyone was kind of shut in everyone started to get a lot of depression as they couldn 't go out and socialize and get distracted and what do you think we can events say there 's the pride things we do every june how about we make more events where it could be about conventions or just regular social events so teens and adults can get out and do you think the solutions is as you say more of that social inclusion rather than formal mental health support or is there a a bit of both a lot of the time i 've noticed is that when you 're out and you 're enjoying yourself you 've got other people and that 's a distraction where i feel like mental health and so psychiatrists that 's a bit more when people more isolate themselves where getting out there and enjoying yourself that definitely improves your mood awesome in the next youth strategy what do you think are three actions priorities or things that you would like to see in there definitely people focusing on mental health like education people educating people and how to help a friend with their panic attacks or if they 've got ptsd how to help them with those fears and reactions and how to actually properly take inflatable world we need more places that are more fun and enjoyable in bendigo and the third one i can 't really think of a third one um is there maybe a third issue or a third challenge transport we definitely need different timings because not once an hour doesn 't work for everyone nailed it good job you 're total legends how are you going today i 'm okay all the input that everybody had yeah cool can you please introduce yourself to me um i 'm abigail i 'm 12. awesome are you from bendigo i am nice what do you think makes greater vinegar a great place for young people to live right now um all the places that they have to go and like the desert and stuff like that yeah when you talk about diversity what do you specifically mean um like the age groups and like the different genders that people have in the sexualities and like the different cultures yeah cool what do you think would make greater benedict a better place for young people um better mental health i think it 's for the older people but not the younger and when you say better mental health do you mean like services or advice or awareness or explain that a little bit like services and advice and just like psychologists to treat stuff yeah cool what do you think is the biggest challenge for young people um probably the um unemployment rate in vancouver yeah and why is that a challenge why do you think that that 's an issue um it just is that 's okay um and how come what can we do to change it um create more jobs and hire younger people instead of choosing the adults because they have more experience great um what would you say are your three actions and they can be things you 've already said what are your three actions priority or things you would like to see in the next strategy um better mental health awareness and stuff like that um better employment and i have no idea cool all good good job go get some lunch [Music] introduce yourself oh hi i 'm dev i live in kangaroo flat and college the purple guys yep cool what have you enjoyed about today um today i 've just loved talking to all different people and getting to know the different views in the community what do you think makes greater vinegar a great place for young people right now um i think by the biodiversity and the big range of cultures available cool and when you say culture what do you mean so like the aboriginal peoples cultures the chinese heritage and just people from different walks of life and why do you think it 's important to recognize that we all have differences or i think it helps us to better understand other people and do that get a better community what do you what would make greater better go better for young people um probably more access to mental health facilities because currently either they 're not that or they 're not much or they 're not very open okay can you when you say they 're not much online not very open you 're saying that um i think more availability times and slots for the younger people people um probably getting or getting into contact with friends and family that live in bendigo because of there 's a lack of public transport and probably need more facilities that help us get from one end to the other okay and how can we change that um maybe implement more bus times and train timetables and just make more frequent and how will that make your life better um we 'll make it better because get to see friends and family easier and more often and in the next youth strategy can be things you 've already said what would be three actions priorities or things relaxing um some way to get the carbon neutral easier transport options and maybe a focus on environment friendly uh options um do you have any ideas as to how we could become carbon neutral um so like windmills or solar power because we could put solar powers in houses and yeah and why is it important to you to be carbon neutral well climate change is a big thing and i feel like our generation is going to be impacted greater greatly help out yeah good job lunchtime all right oh wait i am ready to roll thank you for your patience you 've been so kind and generous with your time today thank you very much can you introduce yourself uh i 'm audrey and what school do you go get uh i go to get in grammar school what year are you in uh year seven and you wear the purple uniform i know i 've asked everybody this i just can 't work it out i know we don 't we don 't really care for you you know what color is it uh mostly maroon right yeah you had a good time today oh yes best part about either today or yesterday i 'm probably getting to work with all of the other youth community members what makes greater benefit a great place for young people to live um well it 's very vibrant and there 's a lot of cultural diversity around and it 's good because we get to celebrate it and it 's really nice just to have a wide range of different people in um because it 's good for us to socialize and it 's also good if we want to become a better community because we can understand what lots of other people are doing and what their life is like as well as ours you talked about it being vibrant is that what you mean or do you mean something else by vibrant as well uh vibrant as in just like very upbeat very happy community everyone gets along yeah awesome what do you think would make greater vinegar a better place for young people um probably maybe just like more like socializing around um so more people can get to know each other and yeah cool do you have any ideas as to how we could do that um maybe like make like meeting like communities more community centres more places where people can gather around and meet up what do you think is the biggest challenge for young people um probably the youth unemployment rate because it is a bit disturbing because it is a high rate so it will be probably better if we had more people be can we change this um probably we can probably change it if people like really take into notice how much younger people aren 't getting the opportunity to be employed and just implementing that making like so people making spaces for young people to actually be employed and just involving young people more yeah awesome in the next few strategies and it can be things you 've already talked about what are three actions or priorities or things you would like to see um probably like more people employed definitely lots of more places for young people to socialize as well and prolly just more people like more chances for people to make friends get to know each other and for people just have more educational opportunities and stuff for career options and lots of other things as well do you think just touching on that last point do you think there 's something missing in terms of opportunity here um well there 's not a lot of like arts opportunities like say you want to do a you want to do a degree in some kind of arts you for younger people up to like 20 years old and then there 's pretty much you 're gonna have to move somewhere else if you want to do something with the arts so yeah cool thank you so much for your time so i am sarah milden and i go to guten gram school and i 'm in year 12. cool what do you enjoy about going again i love the education so the facilities are amazing and the teachers are second to none and i absolutely love socialising with all my friends there as well we 'll just put that in their promo video i 've loved meeting new people like the community is so amazing and being able to integrate and really have a say in the future of bendigo is amazing especially for youth what do you think makes greater vinegar a great place for young people to live i really enjoy that i feel we 're a part of society so we 're not treated as much as children as i 'd expected that we may have been so i feel very much enveloped in the other things that you love about living in bendio i definitely love the schools like the education i think it 's second to none and i think it 's a really top-rate standard cool awesome what do you think would make greta bendigo better for young people in the next four years yeah um so i think their access to higher education and their options is quite limited um and i think that that 's certainly something that probably needs to be improved um and obviously there are barriers that are stopping that from being available but uh i think that 'd be a really crucial part of developing especially if we want that younger demographic to really bloom and thrive in bendigo and what kind of opportunities like is there a particular field that you think we have missing here or um i think that we have a lot of amazing facilities and we have a really broad amount of you know tourism like places that we could have but i think that there are a lot of missing services for youth so i think there really needs to sexual health services for youth um having that friend accessible i think is really important for you know your younger demographic and you know socialization for youth is really important because you want to develop those communication skills um and i feel that there aren 't enough places in bendigo to really develop that skill um really like taking all the questions um but what do you think is the biggest challenge for young people living in great america um finding a place to be able to relax and unwind because personally as a vce student i find that a lot of my time is spent in school studying and our space for interaction outside of that educational setting is very limited so you know if you move into one spot of bendigo you might be labelled as you know a bit not great and yeah it 's difficult to find a place where we can really just relax and unwind in a you know mature and respectful way um and just have that safe space to be able to relax and when you envision that space like what it 's not there i want to be a hub of activity where you know 12 to 24 year olds are able to just sit relax have a space to talk with their friends it 's quiet but it 's also noisy so you have those different spaces to cater for different needs but it also allows people to just step away from the stress of you know everyday life and allows people to just unwind yeah and are there services in their space is there technology in that space is there yeah furniture i definitely think that access to technology especially for those who can 't access it would be a really really amazing thing um and being able to just have the ability to have a safe space to talk to someone potentially so if there is a mental health problem that someone 's facing they can have access to some sort of counsellor or support service to be able to talk um and just ensuring that that 's confidential and able to have a really good space to be able to talk about it you 've probably already again can pick different ones yeah i 've got a couple different priorities so definitely a safe space for youth so that includes your mental sexual health as well having those support services um because i think that 's really big thing and that 's something that 's lacking also accessibility that i think is pretty lacking for some areas it 's definitely not for others but we really need to have your updated transport um so you know if you want to access those types of hubs how do you get there without being reliant on someone else especially if you don 't have that other person to be able to transport you um third priority you got my two um i think just a sense of understanding and i think the council working really close with with the youth is really important because after all we are the demographic and the generation which is going to come through basically help pick things up we 're going to be leading soon very soon and i think that helping and supporting people coming through is really important even as such helping people move from high school to higher education whichever form that may take or helping people find those jobs yeah and what is that link between young people and councils well we 've got our youth council which is really amazing and i love that um but i think there 's not enough visibility about that so before this weekend um i had no idea that there was a youth council and i think having more opportunities for young people to engage with council and give their feedback like it 's a new voice it 's a new generation and really help like society especially the municipality of bendigo just move forward together good job girl that was awesome together and then like and then like they get up into lots of mischief yeah do they solve crime that 's the only all right all right let 's be serious all right let 's see let 's have a can you yourself my name is lily rose gamble yeah great i 'm a kid and um okay thank you and what has led you to be here today so local government and politics and through my connections i saw this opportunity pop up and i thought it would be a great opportunity to voice the young voice of bendigo i 'm sorry i 'm like this isn 't questions that are on the sheet and just interested what has been the highlight for you today or yesterday um meeting other young people who are equally as passionate and finding their passions in this area and watching them grow as individuals able to advocate for themselves yes and what do you think makes greater better a great place for young people to live now i think that the um youth services within local government is one that i don 't think i 've seen in any other lga um and it 's pretty strong and they 're they do a lot within the department and yeah yeah pretty solid um and why do you think it 's important that you know lgas have services like yo video because without services like yo ben indigo um there 's not a place for young people to go to find their advice and place to go physically as our lives can be hectic and very very busy it 's important to have that retreat away from society to be able to talk about our feelings and other than specifically what council does for young people are there other reasons it 's kind of cool to live here the environment schools like anything like sort of external um you can say no no i don 't think so i mean it 's a pretty cool place to live but like as much as young people specific matters go for i wouldn 't have chosen ben to go myself okay um why not i need to go there if it was my decision coming here with a very high youth unemployment rate i wouldn 't have wanted to be here as a young person the education opportunities are much lower than the ones in bigger cities such as melbourne um and the commute can be quite taxing and tiring after a bit so i would have chosen to live more urbanly and they have easier access to that kind of support and education and when of it or i 'm talking about further education and education opportunities so within vce i know that there 's it 's very vast at most schools but it 's still limited to our capacity as schools inventory and how can we change that what can we do about the opportunities well a lot of it comes from the fact that um systemically children or young people won 't put in when we 're talking about subjects for school won 't put in subjects if they don 't know they can ask for that subject to be put in or that that subject exists whereas in melbourne and you go around to all the schools you can see what subjects actually exist and engage with the subject and then pick your school based on that okay cool what do you think would make we 've kind of touched on this but what do you think would make greater vending better for young people specifically in the next four years what can we what could we achieve i would like to see the city work on the youth unemployment um it society 's perception of young people is ever so negative getting young people into employment getting them to stay here and support the economy both through work and spending would very much encourage young people to have a better quality of life in medical and not be pushed to move out of bendigo and how can we do that can we change that i think providing incentives for apprenticeships and traineeships as well as incentives for studying higher education and different degrees in higher education as well as getting our year 12 completion rate advanced so we have more percent of our young people completing year 12 whether that 's by offering more subjects or more vet subjects within the schools what would be your i mean i 've got biggest challenge here but what would be like your top your top two three four and you probably touched on so i think unemployment 's a big one i think i 'd love to see more young people engage with state government in bendigo um through the department um more engagement with their committees and more engagement with their um can we what sort of things can we do to get people involved in state government issues like you 're saying i think it 's a hard one because it 's such a contentious thing and it changes every term but i think a big one is allowing people to come and have a space to advocate for their issues and a space to spread opportunities that 's open to anyone and doesn 't go through a filtering process but doesn 't get filtered down to the political agenda at that stage yeah interesting um in the next use strategy what three actions priorities or things would you like to see included um i would like to see included unemployment education and job opportunities which goes with unemployment perfect um do you have anything else to add anything about all of that good job so the real question is other than icarly what show would you recommend um i am a big fan of the office ah the american version american british not not britainish not not no no no no yeah that 's not controversial but i think oh relate yeah um can you introduce yourself hi hi my name is billy lister and where are you from what are you doing i 'm from castle maine and i 'm in year eight and what brings you to bendigo on a sort of day-to-day basis um i love shopping i have lots of friends and family that live up here and stuff like this forums and events and meetings and what has brought you to be here with everybody um i love making a change for youth my people in my shire and area nailed it i would like to know what you think makes greater bendigo and castleman all of that area a great place for young people to live right now the services there 's a lot of services for mental health and um if you have a disability there 's the right things you don 't have to go traveling to melbourne or i 'm out of state and you can get the things that you need do you think um and you can if you agree you can sort of refrain do you think it what is it about the services that you think is great um that they 're here really because other um small towns like for example heath get if they didn 't have us but in bendigo they 'd have to travel two hours three hours to get those services that they might need urgently and quickly perfect what do you think would make greater benego and surrounding areas better for young people in the next four years um i 've heard a lot over the weekend that a lot of young people don 't feel safe in our area although it is there 's a lot of people around that sometimes at night if they 're catching buses or trains that they don 't feel safe getting on those to get back to their house and do you agree with that is that something you 've experienced yeah yeah cool what do you think we could do to fix that um [Music] i don 't know no idea um what do you think is the biggest challenge for young people um overcoming stress mental health all that stuff and being if they are experiencing those thoughts or if they 're part of the lgbt iq plus community um and that can be really hard sometimes for people to do that yeah and what can we do to help that and fix that um make people feel more comfortable um about talking so like comfort them and ask them if they 're okay um so if we 're talking about like making people feel more comfortable and you know we 're gonna ask them okay and stuff like that how do we change that conversation as a society like how what what would some tools and strategies be that we make um i think we as a area we need to recognize that we 're not all the same and all everyone has their differences and we need to work as a community to recognize them and um know that they 're happening in our area you might have already touched on these things but i would like to know what your three actions or priorities or things that you 'd like to see in the strategy for the next couple in general for young people um especially young men they don 't feel most some people don 't feel comfortable talking about what 's happening in their body or anything like that and um for our area to be more green and sustainable now that 's a different and interesting the sustainability point why do you think that 's important to you um because us as young people we 're the future of our area and our country and if we don 't work towards that now then we might never get to and what kinds of things big or small could we be doing as a council or as individuals to be helping um being mindful of where you put your rubbish if you put it in the wrong bin or the ocean lake or a dam or just be being mindful of where you put it and um just knowing that our world will eventually end if we might do it if we don 't do that now is there anything else you 'd like to add in the usa _"

    "text": "[Music] gender equity to me is in a form a level play level playing field so that usually means equal opportunity in terms of standards of employment chance of employment and pay once a person is employed absolutely although it may be not a way in which people expect so I think a lot of leadership positions jobs are generally perceived as being dominated by males but I think Bendigo and certainly from what I 've seen there is a very interesting dynamic where in a lot of the leadership or the leaders that I see in Bendigo are actually female and certainly some of the more influential ones in Bendigo I think one of the ones that stands out to me came out from quite a I think interesting situation so not too long ago there was a bit of a bit of a crisis in Bendigo education system a principal got Elstad from a school and then another teacher had to be sent in from AC secondary school I was at the time a student at the senior secondary school and a female principal assistant principal stood up acting principal and I would have to say that that was probably one of the best years that that school has seen she was a fantastic acting principal brought about some really wonderful change to the school itself and in terms of staff morale because I 'm quite close to someone who works there she made the school a really welcoming and quite positive place to actually work she cared about the staff she cared about what she was doing as a principal and was passionate about that and genuinely cared for the students that she was essentially supervising advertising hell or better communicating the role that anyone can play in an industry that perhaps they 're not usually involved in I think one of the best examples of sort of a negative spin around this is someone like Renae Gracie so she 's a female touring car driver in Australia and she 's raced at Bathurst multiple times however in those times she 's not necessarily been successful in the general sense and that 's where a lot of that attention has gone unfortunately not towards the fact that in the fact that she 's gotten there in what is otherwise a very male-dominated field and I think that is a bit of a shame one of the good things I 've seen as well in that sort of gender equity area is how well people have taken to AFL W so traditional kind of thing Australian rules football very male-dominated but if you look at how well received AFL w has been and how quickly it 's caught on with the general public and the sporting public that shows that we are hopefully looking forward to some really dramatic and positive change yeah look absolutely um one of the key things that I tell people when I talk about sort of employment and opportunity is earlier this year I was studying in Mal still living here however and commuting down there that made my employment opportunities very slim decided to kind of leave that behind for a little while and take a leave of absence so when I did that I started looking for employment opportunities now I 've got a background in retail specifically fashion retail clothing job before and there were some unfortunate circumstances around that so I was kind of back in the field I applied at maybe ten places around Bendigo and I 'd have to say I probably didn 't hear back from any of them and unfortunately I think that was because they were looking for a kind of certain demographic to hire and I would be so bold to say that that was probably a young female approachable friendly bright maybe not somebody that is necessarily myself let 's say you know sometimes they 're not looking for that kind of 19 20 21 year old male who wants to sell suits or jumpers to other males I think that doesn 't quite fit the ideal of what a say clothing or fashion retail worker is apart from yeah the whole retail clothing retail business I 'd say even just throughout school I 've found that you kind of tend to miss out on certain leadership opportunities or you aren 't necessarily considered for yeah things like those leadership opportunities Theater as well music theater is generally considered a very female-dominated the public speaking and debating field as well so a lot of really strong young females coming through that sharing strong points and while that is a good feel I think that 's something that schools tend to look for a little too much whether that be because they just think that young males aren 't interested they 'd rather be playing sport or whatever that may be I found that that is a trend that is popping up and as a result I think I 've missed out on opportunities like that during my schooling where I really would have liked to have that chance and say be that person behind that lectern quite possibly I 'm a fairly visually and aesthetically driven person so I think if I hadn 't have been exposed to a certain stigma of what I should be doing as a person maybe I could have branched out into say a kind of fashion design field gone into theatre gone into art or even even journalism I think in the journalism field there 's a certain perception that male journalists can be a bit kind of hardball interviewers and that 's not necessarily the person I would have wanted to be and I think that could have been a missed opportunity and something yeah I wouldn 't have been fortunate to be a part of aside from the female principal that I was talking about acting principal Linda Lyons brilliant woman I would have to say someone like Michelle natal so she was a French racing driver during the 80s which was the kind of peak of what was called a Group B she was a test driver for Audi at the time when they were really very influential to the to the racing scene and her success and her influence wasn 't really very well advertised at all and I think that is really a shame because she was one of the pioneer women in motorsport and that 's simply massive really other than that I 'd probably have to say julia gillard as divisive as that is to some people I think it 's fair she was the first female prime minister she stood her ground despite a lot of flak and was a shame for Australia 's first female prime minister tonal gender equity in Bendigo I think we 'd have a really interesting shift in dynamic and how Bendigo interacts as a city I think it could be a far more interesting and perhaps metropolitan place so I think already we 're doing a great job with people like our mayor Margaret O 'Rourke you know you kind of see parallels between her and the Lord Mayor of Melbourne Sally Kat I think in terms of kind of women in leadership we 're doing a great job I 'd love to see kind of more women in those less celebrated fields having some influence having some push but then seeing men feel like they 're being comfortable to kind of push in those directions where maybe we haven 't seen them go before places like modeling at the Bendigo Fashion Festival we I did I think last year as part of one of my previous jobs and things like that where we can be inclusive and be equities and really push that boundary to be a more equal and accepting in the grand scheme of things we 're still a small city as well so we really need to be understanding what we are as a community and pushing towards something that is more inclusive [Music] _"

    "text": "and I don 't need to remind you but I will that term that you know healthy diet is now and being overweight or obese is actually now the leading cause of death and disability in Australia so whilst we haven 't totally sorted out the smoking issue there are subgroups within us community who still smoke too much overall this is where it is when we 're trying to to influence health and well-being it 's about food and diet and we often associated with obesity and here 's our not-so-great statistics the greater bendigo but let 's not forget and we 've just heard from Michelle about the other outcomes that come from food about you know it 's a social lubricant for our life isn 't it 's what we come together as we 're all planning for Christmas we 're thinking about the food what are we going to buy what are we going to present you know who 's going to bring what to the family young-do so it 's really important that we also recognize it has other implications so it does have impacts we that we need it creates a sense of belonging as we 've just heard creates a whole range of other skills and abilities to function in society so it 's really a very important component of our lives and as a next dietitian you know who lives to eat doesn 't need to leave food is very I 'm very passionate about food I ate at your establishment last night and it was absolutely stunning what you say took my husband there from a birthday but food it 's the whole production as we 've heard from Amy so here 's a slide just reinforcing that so it is about about their production and processing and distribution and consumption and it sort of said again as an excitation to here this theme about people not knowing how to prepare food I 'm an old-fashioned dietician we were taught to cook before we could be a clinical dietitian I 'm afraid that doesn 't always happen anymore so it really is important that we have all the skills now as some of you would know the city is responsible as and well-being planned for the for our community we do it every four years it 's a requirement of the public health and well-being Act and and so we 've created our plan and I encourage you to check it out if you haven 't seen it on our website because it was developed with looking at the data looking at policy and talking to the community and and picking up themes from other community engagement that council does food came up as something that we needed much more focus on so traditionally local governments been big in the exercise space particularly in the organized sport and recreation space we haven 't probably had such a big role around food so we 're developing like a lot of organizations we 're developing and building our capacity around this space and these are just a few of the things that we 've been working on I 'm just going to talk about a couple and after many trips going to talk about the gastronomy work so we 're looking at it from a whole holistic point of view so we 're health point of view Trevor looks at it from an economic development point of view we are working in that whole cycle of food so it 's a bit it 's a bit rough to go out and tell other people how they should eat and how they should have the healthy food if you don 't do it yourself so well so you know I can walk around work and find soft drink and you know Amy talked about the giveaways at meetings and you know we have the fundraisers in the tea rooms and all of those sorts of things they 're all not very healthy so over the last six to 12 months we 've been doing consultation internally about moving to adopting a healthy catering policy we 're not going to go cold turkey because you know frankly people will go ballistic so we 're gradually going to introduce healthy choices for their state government guidelines if you 're not aware with them across our organization over the next two years and it will challenge some people but particularly the council is particularly one particular council if we 're going to be if we don 't ask other groups and organizations to do the work around healthy food then we need to do it ourselves we 're just finishing the process of creating a catering panel so we 've gone to the market because we do as a council purchased quite a lot of catering for various events although after this policy will be probably purchasing a little less that we used to but but we have gone to and created a panel now of about a half a dozen to eight organizations who 've committed to be able to provide us healthy choices and it might well be overtime we can encourage them to wear get out and promote their their catering to other parts of the Greater Bendigo community so that you can use them we haven 't just you know healthy catering we haven 't just asked them about healthy food we 've also asked them about sustainability and waste and some of those other things so that so we 've taken a more holistic approach to the way we think about our and our environment area are looking at urban agricultural guidelines so one of the challenges of living and in Greater Bendigo and and producing your own food is remembering what the history of Greater Bendigo was and being sure that we 're actually not going to harm anyone by getting them to grow through that has high levels of arsenic and other things that come from our gold mining history so just helping people to think about if they 're going to grow food and we would like people to get involved in growing their own food that they do it in a way that is safe one of the roles of local government is and I think we 've got one of our environmental health officers here today is making sure that our environment is safe and so well so you know it 's all very good to pick up your good nutrients and then in a hefty dose of of mineral arsenic as well wouldn 't go down too well so it 's important that we get this really clear so in trying to do the right thing we 're doing and we 're very happy this year to have had funding approved by council for a food systems officer Sobek is she 's got a hand up over here so Beck has started with us and her main role is to help us develop a ten year food system strategy and we and that will cover the whole cycle of the food and in complements very well with the work that Trevor 's doing around the guest City for gastronomy and our objectives are to try to work with our partners hence you guys about how we strengthen and support Bend goes greater bendigo the food system and identified new and emerging opportunities learn from what people are doing perhaps dinner in smaller spots across the organ the community and see how we can actually disseminate those further so you know what Michele 's doing there that that 's just fabulous isn 't it we need to find out where that 's happening and importantly where it 's not happening so that we can try to support it to happen in more places and have a common work together Council can 't_``_458.4 do this on it on their own no organization or community group can do this on their own so um so hopefully you know today will feed into the development of that strategy and they 'll be more work and they 'll be as councilors want to do put out draft documents and various other things that people can make contribution to and make a comment on so that we get it right it will look at things like food security food literacy production processing distribution retail you know one of the challenges we 've got at the moment is we 're trying to get some of our larger recreation facilities to implement healthy choices but they don 't always have a production they don 't always have food that they can buy to actually put in their cafeterias and cafes and so forth so it 's important that we get that pipeline happening so that it 's easy for us to say to the Tennis Center and the stadium we want you to do healthy choices and by the way here 's a whole source product from so they don 't have to produce everything from scratch so so we are we do have any internal little working group working on this and we will have some external consultation as well so that we end up with a strategy that really that everybody can can buy into I notice Beck we don 't have a slide here on the food hub but we probably should just mention the food hub work so so I think Jen 's mentioned the feasibility for the greater bendigo food hub and we are partnering with the food Alliance and future and looking at where we can locate a food hub for greater bendigo that is much more than food chair future would certainly be Foundation partner but it 's it 's also opportunity to produce food for local producers to to store and have them provide logistics for so it 's again looking at the whole system so we 're at the moment we 're shortlisting our sides and then and then we 'll get to the next stages for us is the business plan and then we Development Victoria and others about how we can source the funding to do this to create this food hub for Greater Bendigo which we 're very excited about it and certainly we 're hearing more and more this is an approach that 's happening across the world so there just a few things that are happening at the city and hopefully complements with Australia we 'll have a lot more things that we 'll be doing over time as I said we don 't want to do this work on our own we want to partner with you and with people that you know and other community groups so that we actually make a real difference in this space so thank you for your time [Applause] _"

    "text": "it 's always a great pleasure for me to talk about how it all started because I I never get tired of telling the story and I never get quite over the fact that it 's actually happened I think the most important thing in my life is that when I grew up which is a long ago path and I was among talking in the 50s my family were very interested in food and this was very unusual there was nobody that I knew who whose parents had the same sort of attitude of sitting around a table at night my father had had a very early introduction to wine in a very you know short trip to Europe when he was a very young man and we had table wine on the table from the time I can always remember and this was 1956 no earlier than that before the Olympic Games anyway my mother loved food she loved to cook but she loved food probably as much if not more as an expression of culture and she cultivated and made friends with anyone she could find that and had something that could teach her or show her something new or different and when I brought kids home from school for tea they knew through their eyes would pop and they would say to me don 't you ever have chops and please we do sometimes but we don 't only have chops and please we have lots of other things too and those memories are very precious to me of that growing up when I was still at school and I suppose I 've never ever lost the absolute conviction that the belief in the power of positive modeling and how important our early years and of course that 's really this being the start of where we 've started with the kitchen-garden foundation I know that not everybody had that background I 'm aware that it gave me a huge advantage I 'm very sad that my mother died before I really was able to say to her just how much that had given me I mean I 'm still realizing to this very day that having that sort of background where people sat around a generations where we talked and we laughed and we argued and the food was always set out beautifully and it was simple food but it was fresh food most of it from the garden some from the garden it 's not exaggerated it was an absolutely blissful way to grow up and it wasn 't until I went to university and went into a women 's college which was my first experience of institutional food a lot of my friends at god audience bill like went to local high school and I could not believe was that was being served to what we 're supposed to be young adults 18 19 years old and will given sliced white bread for lunch and I thought speeches about it we probably drove everybody mad but I knew what I had had and this was not eat this was not what we 've got ought to be happening then I went to live in France and taught in a teacher training College where the students were eighteen and nineteen they were training to be primary school teachers and those kids every day had little entree first little carrot salad followed by a little something or other it 'll braise the pork chop followed by a big bowl of green salad on the table followed by little squares of camembert and a bowl of fruit that was considered a normal lunch for an eighteen-year-old student and the difference could not have been more stark and explains a great deal about where I 've come from and what I think is important so we 're not going to go through all this except it 's really the importance of that slide is to emphasize how long it 's taken to get where we are now and to in 2001 I went to the principal of collingwood college and I said I 've got this idea can we give it a go in the meantime I had 35 years running restaurants and I 've been very involved with young people apprentices people in front and back parts of restaurants and I became very aware that although they were wonderful people many of them still very dear friends of mine many of them really had very little started all the noise the public noise in the newspapers magazines radio etc started talking about food choices and poor food choices so it was a bit it was really sort of a sense that this was very much in the in the air that people saw the need to change the way we were talking about food and in my opinion the way we were teaching or not teaching our very young children about having a broad and active interest in every aspect of food so anyway we started with Collingwood that was very successful within either started lobbying which I think I 'm still doing to this day and it 's been variously successful we 've had a lot of support from governments on the way little bits of support then it stops the government changes and then it stops and then we start lobbying again and then we find that we have to make the program a bit more flexible and Josephine continued a lot more about that and by 2015 we will have reached what we said was going to be our tipping point it that Australian schools I think we 're now eleven eleven percent of all Australian schools have got a Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden project of some sort some are much bigger than others some are tiny and just starting out others are really away and running and doing amazing things 2017 we 've actually embraced early learning and we 've just started a pilot program into the secondary years which we do not know how that 's going to work so it 's very very early days the other thing I just wanted to say was that the kids in this program learn the most amazing things they I mean we 're a not-for-profit charity we believe our job is to support the schools and to do whatever we can to ensure the quality of the program that 's being delivered in schools all around Australia clearly we cannot visit all schools all around Australia from the Pilbara kalgoorlie it has been our darkest parts of really I mean it 's the most remarkable program for its breadth and reach and so we hear stories from all sorts of schools very little to is one that had 20 students but I know there are smaller schools and there 's another school in Victoria that has 1,400 schools they 're quite extraordinary to think that a particular program can be flexible enough to accommodate those two different extremes and I just I think for me the most fascinating thing is going into the schools and just watching the kids and seeing what they learn and what they do and because I always taste their food and it 's always beautiful and we see them getting their knife licence getting their wheelbarrow licence understanding how to look after aquaponics I mean amazing things are happening in the schools they make beautiful bread many of the schools have their own others they make pasta they make soups to make dips they make flat breads they make curry they make really shows chutneys and wonderful stalls of their school fairs and most importantly for them they eat together and one of the most exciting and almost goose-bumpy bits for me is seeing that their faces light up when it 's time to sit at the table it 's the whole idea of gathering around a table which sadly for many of these children is a rare experience they do not do this regularly at home and I personally think that 's just a great tragedy but in the classroom situation the eating together is just wonderful to see they almost always have a little posy of herbs in the middle of the table in some schools I 've seen them they 're lighting candles even at 10 past 00 in the morning and the play the food is always put on the table as a platter so that if they 've made a pizza it 's not divided up it 's put there if they 've made risotto it 's in a bowl so they can see it and this to me anyone who in the room is if he was a lovely cook knows that moment when you put the dishes out on the table and you realize just how beautiful it is before it gets dished up and squashed and it 's sliced and there is that moment and they dane just be and influenced by and understanding the impact it 's having on those kids and then we hear from their parents the trickle-down effect is going home talking to mom and dad talking to grandparents sometimes creating their own little small gardens we don 't we don 't want to make ridiculous claims because they 're certainly not all going home and making a garden but almost all children are going home and talking to their parents and making suggestions when the family goes shopping or saying when they are going shopping we made that at school why don 't we buy some fennel my mum says what 's fennel and show you how to make anyway we 're a professional development is incredibly important these are the things that we think are really at the heart of the program but it emphasizes flavors and health but we don 't emphasize the word hillier it 's a very subtle difference I emphasize the word pleasure to me nobody changes behavior or modifiers behavior if the alternative that 's being offered to them is something that is you know finger wagging or full something you 're finding really enjoyable and possible so we we 're concentrating on giving kids skills and understanding so they can do all these things and feel very proud and their self-esteem they just swill with excitement and pride it 's about fresh food of course it 's about seasonal food and it 's about growing and cooking it from scratch we never we which they can we don 't go in for them making lots of stock because they haven 't got time but they don 't use them dishes that need stock so we make we just use what we 've got and we use it as creatively and wonderfully as we can sweet dishes bit of an issue and we say sometimes only we don 't we don 't say that never but sometimes only is the go and particularly as many schools now I have extensive orchards and those trees are often six and seven years old now and fruiting well so it would be tragic not to not to use that lovely fruit and the other thing that 's very important in talking to can claim truthfully that this program integrates perfectly with the learning curriculum that there 's the other things that we want our children to understand at school it 's rich in literacy and numeracy it 's rich in mathematical concepts it 's rich in cultural understanding it 's rich in all the environmental sciences investigating what 's the life in the garden it 's wonderful for art and design and they 're just a few things and of course it has unbelievable social benefits those children in those classes develop great responsibility they talk they make decisions between each other little groups this has got enough seasoning in it is this this has cut the right way that sort of thing so teamwork and responsibility we just see all the time and the teachers comment on that there 's never any naughty behavior it 's just concentration pleasure a nice animated bars all the time in the classroom but but really wonderful Josephine I think you should now talk about is it we 'll have plenty of questions at the end on protein I 'm trying to rush the way does that all mean in a kitchen garden school or a kitchen garden center how does it all come together and that 's what we call pleasurable food education pleasurable food education model is delivered through a kitchen garden program that 's what 's the difference between the software and the hardware that makes sense so hardware is a kitchen garden program and kitchen garden program relies on these four pillars of growing harvesting and preparing and sharing and that 's the four pillars that we encourage schools to schools and centers to take on so the kids grow their own food hopefully they 've also helped design and plan and built the garden as well so they 're completely engaged with that they know how to nurture they 're taught how to nurture those crops they love their seedlings they want to plant in the ground they want to stop tests but they want to stop pests organically so that they can eat the food that they 're that they 've grown it 's in the school environment or it 's in their education environment because they have to that at home get it at school they learn how to harvest their crops really gently and in a protective and nurturing way they take those crops into some kind of kitchen space in their school or Center it doesn 't have to be a purpose-built kitchen at all it can be the staff room the canteen the out of school hours Center the art room anyplace there 's a tap so that they can wash their produce and their hands and bench space for cooking they can use electric fryer plants it 's a really really simple model and through that we help the educators in those schools and centers deliver the pleasurable food education philosophy that makes sense next so what are those ingredients are we 've mentioned professional development a couple of times teachers don 't come out of teaching school with a kitchen garden program philosophy they need professional development to understand what can be gained from the program like this and especially in how to integrate it with their curriculum teachers don 't need extra curricular stuff they need intra curricular stuff that they can teach so we help them we give them resources that show them how to teach literacy in the garden how to teach and we see in the kitchen how to integrate it with their science and their hearts and all of the subjects that 's definitely mentioned it 's a really important part of the program and in early years we 're almost at the point where we 've constructed the model for early years we 're making sure that it fits the early years development framework we give them the resources to do that we have a lot of print resources we also have a large growing Bank of online resources that that the educators can take pick from choose from there 's planning resources recipes those case studies there 's a lot of different things that we give to educators to help them as this program they access a lot of that through what we call our teaching arm class for membership there is now over 5,000 educators in our online community community that we call the shared table they all come there and they 're posting all everyday there 's a most almost every half an hour in our community and they 're downloading resources and they 're interacting with each other they 're getting support from our staff and they 're showing everyone what they 're doing that 's an incredible dynamic environment we can if able to given the resources to we will customize professional development for school so a lot of schools are coming to us now so we want the whole staff integrated with this program as I say we can do it can we break even who can help with this but if we can we 'll do it we also have that what we call a support line which is our staff in our office in Melbourne on the phone and on their email every day taking questions from educators and across Australia saying what chicken why should I use or my parents don 't understand why we 're doing this healthy or we 've got to find a grant to get a bulldozer in and level out this space helpless and that 's what we 're here for to so time ago some of you in the road buyers heard that you need a 60,000 kitchen and you need staff and you need huge grants to make this program happen that 's not the case if you think that please stop thinking that we don 't do that we say start small use what you 've got and we 'll help you grow and what they 've got often is their community so this has always been a community back when one of our schools one of our first schools is able walk which you would have visited Stephanie they had amazing program but it 's adapted over time and that 's good because it suits them and with that probably would have suggested to them that they have a community meeting at the very start bringing anyone who 's interested in helping them with their program tell them what they 're trying to do and leverage some support and the community was around that and we 'd love to see that and we can see that happening in the room down so we have an adaptable model we want school community and for the center community and for bigger communities of networks of kitchen-garden schools and centers so we work with the community to do this in a way it works for them we also as Stephanie mentioned are working on a chronic virus primary at the earliest model and a secondary year 's model so that the educators in those sectors can get resources and professional development that works for them so the benefits huge benefits so while this started off most certainly as a health prevention program and a health intervention based on getting kids to love and want to eat good food there are so many benefits everyone knows here you start talking about food and all of these other things happen they see the kids Stephanie said again the confidence and pride and the self-esteem that they get from that from doing this program is incredible walking to so many schools that would come that can be capital letters for a reason there 's so many kids who are not come in their school environment because of what 's happening outside of the school the Arden 's of greenery and bean teepees and art and everyone working together and we go into the kitchen and the principal will say see that kid over there he 's the most volatile kid in the whole school we can 't control him and he 's sitting there just chopping up the carrot frying it on the stove asking his friends what they would like to add and sitting quietly down to eat and they say that 's the only time that child comes down and we calm down when we walk into the school pound after all hurly-burly and the traffic and the radio and the World War 3 that 's going on we walk into a kitchen garden school when everyone just calms down that 's amazing so they learn life skills they start to learn about other work pathways that might they might not have opened up to them at the school they become engaged with learning I want to go to school because it 's kitchen-garden day today we hear that all the time they link their real life contextual hands-on learning with their curriculum a whiteboard and being told this is what a fraction is they 've already seen that when they 're sliced up their pizza they know it it 's changed their mindset already so it 's not so difficult for them to absorb the classroom learning that they 're forced to do they take the program home to families families are constantly coming to us and telling us about the impact of the program you 've changed our lives they say my autistic child would never eat anything that was in front of him and because of what he 's learnt at school we can now sit down as a family and back together we hello and community building as I said the community comes around the school to help because it 's such a great program everybody loves it everyone wants to be involved what can we do to help let 's have a working bee Bunnings Bunnings is an amazing community resource they want to help your pens all over australia and responsible the responsibility of Bunnings pathways volunteer groups councils businesses wanting to donate drawing gourds appliances grants by what the school is doing they start to embrace the philosophy and the more schools that happen together in little environments the more impact that has on the community probably mentioned also the amazing increase in enrollment my name principal after principal tells us that their early years are increasing because the school has a kitchen garden program which is great yeah it 's amazing and we see the signage out there where a kitchen garden program school islands out there for a reason because people are drawn to it we also say teachers using the program for lots of other practices for mental health including oral health including trying to bring their cultures around their school together some amazing stories we hear about that they 're using it to teach agriculture where there is none they 're teaching kids where their food comes from they 're connecting them with local farmers there which helps the farmers mental health as well and they 're using it for all of their environmental sustainability programs it 's huge the amount of impact this program can have so what do we actually PAE the resources the membership and support for us as much as we possibly and physically can we would like to do more they don 't get into that we want to help the schools build partnerships with each other and us and our partnerships with our special friends who invest in our work and help us help the schools we want to empower school communities school communities by that I mean there 's people that are in the school our staff and the students and their families and all the businesses and organizations that surround that school we want to empower that community so that they can choose good food make good food the norm we 're continually developing the program model to be more and more flexible and more and more adaptable to unique environments we evaluate as much of them as we possibly can with the resources available so that we 're constantly learning from what all the school communities are doing then we 're providing data to government to say that this kind of thing really works we capture and share the knowledge there 's so themselves because they 've got really creative and resourceful teachers and educators so we want them as much as possible to tell us about all of these fantastic activities so that we can share them with the rest of the school community it 's a great way of sharing knowledge and of course we want to say something like pleasurable food education sitting inside the Australian Curriculum just like maths just like English just like music just like care just like all those other really important things food it is one of those things so the cluster model tell me if you don 't understand this when I 'm talking about school communities what we are trying to see is schools in local geographic area it 's very much like the greater city of Bendigo working together on their kitchen garden programs and changing the food landscape in those communities because it 's a great place to change the lead through your landscape from because schools have to be there you don 't have to ask a permission from the government to have a school it 's their kids have over their lifetime so it 's a wooden base it 's a solid foundation to start something but we see that them working together galvanizes the community even more so at school here 's black eagle Hawk has been running the program ten years can help the school down the road with their programs they have a lot of experience and knowledge they 're having the Learning Center 's now coming into the program learn from the primary schools exchange resources share opportunities buy in bulk travel in bulk learn from each other and they each other 's buddy that 's the support network that we 're trying to create now and that 's what we call the cluster model ultimately if we had our way we would have a project officer in every region helping those cluster models come together and make the most out of what they 've got we don 't yet have the resources to do that but we 're working on it so we want to change communities we hear a lot about their basic genic environment that 's what we want to change we to be the norm we want water to be the drink of choice you want kids to be outside gardening with their families and with their community helping them that 's what we want to change so we want to work with everybody here on how we can all do that together we want to contribute to what is already happening here which is really exciting and we can see the energy in the room that how do we do that how do we bring everyone together it 's fantastic for Amy so what are we what are we going to do from here to keep that happening and how can we help it 's we 're in Melbourne how can we help you guys with what you 're trying to do that 's what we 'd like to do we have currently 11 schools and earlier centres in the Greater Bendigo area and that 's out of a total of 98 so we 'd always like to bring more into that cluster environment okay always we 're here we 're ready come to us we can help you we area for our early years program so if you know of an early year center who 's really ready and right to go with something that looks like the kitchen-garden program please let us know I 've got some fliers for you but we 're still paying to work with the rest of the community on what we can do to help the schools and the kids any questions about any of this before this please kids with agriculture yeah it 's not a fully fleshed-out program yet but we 're working on this o is a is if we we want to show kids where their food comes from we want that to be part of their life and their world vision so they might not become growers themselves when they grow up but they will know the effort and energy that goes into their food when they 're purchasing it so they understand the agricultural landscape and not understand what farmers face every day what we 're seeing is that a lot of schools on the back of this program although of how we want to show them farmers and take the kids out there to visit them and those farmers who are just desperate for some community attention desperate for some support are just so gratified by the interest and engagement that those kids have with them they 're so excited and then the farmer or the grower can come into the school and show the kids what they do within the school environment and again it 's that sharing of knowledge and sharing of experience is a massive boost to them and it helps create those connections within that community very fundamental yes yes that 's absolutely and we see the arable land just disappear in as the sprawl continues outwards and where I was being under increased pressure all the time and again coming back to their school model that school site has to be there so it can become a site of urban agriculture and the growers can still contribute to that community that they 're sort of being edged out of and the kids still have that environment that they 're coming to every day not just being exposed to McMansions and who the educators in the schools represent the community at black as diverse as it is so in some schools who have an educator in a school has got a special interest in and that special interest gets brought into the kitchen garden program um and I visited a school in Queensland about it a year ago and was invited into the kitchen class and those kids are in grade four were turning their camembert and needling their blue cheeses because the educator happened to be a cheese maker and so she was using her skills to enliven their kitchen their kitchen class and now in a few weeks ago I was in South Australia and the kids in that school wanted me to come and have a look at their native beehive and it 's a that and that that particular school had somebody who 's very interested in rooftop honey and wasn 't also interested in native bees so that 's sort of freedom for the educator to give a personal slant not a slant but it 's just a speciality happens all over the country and that 's up the what the schools of Hosting it 's often really surprising what they 're doing yes sir just practically for those 86 or 87 schools that aren 't signed up what what are the logistics of getting involved does it cost money I presume it costs money and you know where how the schools generally go about sort of getting going and where did they get that initial money far more do they ever some examples from other places about how people get going yeah this is where we come back to our membership normal so our business model and our charitable purpose allows us to support a school or sent up once they become a member a membership costs one hundred and ten dollars a year and one hundred and sixty-five dollars to join and that 's all so that gives these people access to a shared table which is our online community we call it the shared table and it gives access to support from our staff so they can ring us and talk to us at anytime they want but also it gives them huge discounts nothing we 'd love to talk to government but for instance it all gives them about a five hundred dollar discount on the actual cost of training so they can come to a professional development day we help them regionally when we can so if there 's enough into in the area and we get about 20 or 30 educators coming that 's a break even for us and we can give to run them through a whole day of professional development where they learn basic skills to transfer back to these kids they have an amazing lunch together and learn about curriculum integration and what they 're going to plan how they got to plan out their program and they make contact with each other which is really crucial they also get discounts on our resources but they once they get into the shared table there 's so many resources there the others are extras if that makes sense so we can help with all of the planning we just need them to contact us so how much does a professional development day cost two hundred and fifty dollars know and they are amazing days and teachers just reel away at the end of the days they can 't believe we 've not only had such a fabulous day but we 've learned such a lot they do and we got a lot of council sponsoring schools to do this if they 're really really strapped we 've got a lot of councils good I mean it 's named this part of our health and well-being plans we will help that school get on board and then we 'll suggest to the school okay what have you got what if you 've got in your school now if you 've got any piece of land or if you 've got some walls that get some Sun some time or a giant rooftop we can work with that get in touch with community helpers who can do that there 's always someone who 's really good at gardening in the community it 's always someone I 'm in the parent community who 's a builder or a plumber or a laborer or an architect or all of these people can professional about they have absolutely give three examples of the most recent regional development professional development one so a couple of our staff members went down to tazzie I think that was Launceston and they were gobsmacked at the amount of enthusiasm that that being there in that community helped to galvanize in the schools around them so it is a bit of even community helps really bring the spirit up so then we 're able to get people around everyone came with some different kinds of honey 's because everyone was growing bees at home growing these we met each other before so the the training guys that went down there came back saying this is whole community it 's just coming out of this and they 're sitting down to a that 's like they 're just having it 's professional development by staff for most because they don 't know how much they 're learning when they 're just doing these things and the interacting with each other and having a really joyful time together and then they talk to each other afterwards and say what are your site not her there 's a grant over here let 's go for it that 's the kind of thing that we say happening either reason 20 at the at the moment it is already a mix so we don 't say no to early use early we want early years to come to myself a lemon of those members that we have in bending our early years as a huge earliest movement at the moment it is mixed but were a bit concerned that because of our original primary school focus we haven 't got what we wanted to give the early years so we 're working on what professional developments are sitting to early years looks like a my work a lot with cooks nineteen so the my six bombs my sorry I 've seen your nine million times just [Music] chimes and dandy guys people at school [Music] wasn 't it Mary Ann Rooney and then she went to winters flat said the same thing there yeah so really you know principle that really believes in the program often takes it with him or her as I saw her the other day we 're just starting out with schools but a lot of yeah my kids now that high school yeah and they 're so engaged get water but now my kids are at high school and there 's a community garden within the high school it 's really frustrating to be right it 's a real shame yeah so we 've had these questions which assisted us to seek funding from our corporate and we now have funding to start a kitchen garden program for secondary years we don 't know what that looks like yet secondary environments very different from primary so we are probably around 8 months 10 months into that project but we 're just working with three pilot schools nanner Lauren South 's one thing is the western heights in Geelong and deburr corrupt in their Shepherd in and we they 're a really engaged team of staff and students and again we don 't know what that program model will look like but we do know that a narrow Warren e V how students had already built the pizza oven cool gun on the wall where they 'd cut them out they had all these beautiful strawberries growing down hanging down the wall I love that very clever with the irrigation pipe right they were lovely a lot of high schools of sagging this will fit perfectly into our beach house dream these kids are at risk of just disengaging altogether no we give them something really tangible to do and give it something to feel really proud about which is what exactly what we saw at Nara Lauren I was amazing we said we 're going to have this launch here and the whole the whole video else right worked like Treves for three weeks and just built this guy out of there with nothing and then turned around and went oh my God look what we did just based on a bit of bit of momentum so we are working with secondary we would want to make sure that the model we give out is something that will work that would be the galaxy animus worked on the Jevens game that was grand the Ottoman which was an pretty was he 's a priest you know entertained came with that students actually cooking feeding it needs to be Health Program horticulture and hospitality sitting down the students having lunch what is just and you could just say as a teacher you could see the change in the student and it just took on and also took students into TAFE and took the students into further education and gray engaged because our extra learning than you receive illiteracy and something that 's exactly what we all want that 's right I do have to acknowledge just just before we wrap up that we have a very special partner Medibank there is potentially a Medibank retail store in this area they want to help it 's one of the partnerships we we have and we want to leverage their staff are really engaged and what to help so we can talk about that too the last slide is this is how you get in touch with us that 's really really simple or you just come to me and get a card or or I 'll take yours either way available on our website and there are people dedicated in our office to answer any of your questions or all anyone has to do is get in touch and we can go from there and in my final word is that we have the most extraordinarily dedicated staff I mean Josephine 's doing a marvelous job as a new CEO and how many happy people do we have you know from just from starting with my personal assistant in my spare bedroom in 2001 and lobbying lobbying lobbying endlessly to a situation where we really are a very hardworking and very professional organization and I think we 've gained enormous awareness I 've just finished a book tour which has taken me all over Australia and whenever I was talking to people supposedly about my new book which I haven 't even given a rap to but anyway everybody in the room knew about the kitchen-garden Foundation so whatever we haven 't done we have spread the word and that people can talk about it and think about it a lot of those people were probably no longer parents of or they know other people and so on and I was really knocked out about the overall awareness of the work that 's been done so they really are an amazing team _"

    "text": "so some of you have been on the journey already witness around the city of Gaston be bid but many want meeting purpose a lot that familiar with it this come about I think was about twelve months ago and Vicki was on the at the meeting actually when we start to talk about in developing a creative city as a strategy councils whole endeavor in this area 's been to build the creativity of bending on a general sense we became aware of the UNESCO creative cities Network and you probably some of you will know about that network but many of you right and I 'll explain a little bit in detail but firstly I just want to talk about the basis of this whole international network it was established in 2004 by UNESCO and they created this in a bit of a slow gestation but it 's really taken off in the last few years we 've now got a situation where there are 180 cities around the world from 72 countries that are involved there are seven categories categories like music and literature and film and food and beverages and you might think that gastronomy has a connotation that this is sort of high-end eating it 's meant to embrace the full spectrum of food and beverages and 26 cities have now joined that network and you might think ah this would all be about being with our high-profile cities many of the cities that are in the network quite small in fact councilor gentlemen and I visited one city called Albert in northern Italy at 30,000 people so they actually are encouraging of smaller cities it 's not a network about high-end high profile cities big companies is about what people are doing at a local creative level which is which is really what we 've been hearing there are four seasons in Australia at the moment here upon UNESCO greatest cities network Melbourne sea of literature Sydney city of film adelaida city of music and as of late last year Geelong city of design so if our application is successful and those applications are due in July next year verification is successful we would become the first city of gastronomy in Australia now one the only category we 've and talk about a region and this has been very important and it 's really great to hear from people talking broader than just been to go here this is about the whole region because it 's a region that produces your fifth your food and beverage so the region that we 've defined is actually a very impressive region many of you would be for me with the term encompassing region which is those six municipalities that 's messin Rangers smell exam de modern central Gold Fields and compassed the as well as Ben do so that 's a region that 's used by a lot of organizations but one of the other regions that we 've gone to is the north central catchment Management Authority region which really embraces 9 years of Polynesian was the natural physical setting if you like of the region so the the laden belly the compass '_``_201.5 B Valley the Avon Richardson Valley and that takes us right to the top of the Great Dividing range so they includes municipalities like Hepburn but it also takes us into overlaid on this and these regions almost coincide completely with each other is the region of the judge are wrong and the judge are wrong about two-thirds of that north-central sigueme region and so this has been a very important part of our application and at the moment we we know there 's one of us a city competing with us already to be a city of gastronomy as a LAN system and the reality will be that the unesco office in canberra can only support a city a one city in a category so we 're already in a competitive situation will know by about this time next year when we 've been successful so what are we on about with this some this vision of being a nesco creative city of gastronomy many of the points i 'm making the next two slides have really been covered by many of our speakers we 're talking here yes we 're talking about a better understanding of what our food heritage is what our current issues are around food consumption it 's very much around the the idea that this of the community embraces our heritage think of the think of the when you talk about that region think of things like the Swiss Italians who were around they have Bern region the Chinese that have added so much to our cuisine the Korean community at the moment that are adding into our story Vicki talked a lot about the social role and others have talked about the social role of food these are all important elements that we 're trying to bring out in this application we 're talking about food security we 're talking about how food can be used to break down cultural barriers barriers we 're all familiar with those concepts and of course we 're talking about the health issues and lifestyle issues so we based this application actually around four pillars and the first pillar is really based on the idea that we had about whether we have 40 50 thousand years of sustainable food systems in this region and one of the interesting things about working with the judge are wrong on this concept is that of course they identify that they not 're aware of they actually had things like volcanoes were happening so they 're yeah they 're landscape was changing I was hoping the timing would allow me to show you the the logo that we have developed for our application which would become if we are receive guests front of me the logo we would use we only just got the the final proofs of it yesterday and it hasn 't been totally signed off but the logo is based around the concepts that the judge Arirang embraced so the indigenous community worked on six seasons those seasons are based Department on the weather they 're based on the movement of animals they 're based on the growing cycles of plants and the logo that the judge our um have come up with which is fantastic really it 's it looks like a plate it has six concentric rings around in within the plate and each ring is a different color and those rings they vary in width and intensity illustrating the fact that the seasons themselves are not consistent one quarter of that that concentric series of concentric one quarter has been cast out and it 's been moved the concept being that when Europeans arrived we broke the continuous cycle and that what we really have to do now is work to bring that back to a whole being bring that back to a circular sustainable system and this very much embraces the concept that the judge are wrong if you have got if you read their country plan their country plan has nine pillars in one of those pillars is about bush tucker it 's about understanding the full range of production that was across the region and it 's quite remarkable and I 'll just just use the example of the MER nan or diem Daisy it 's a it 's an annual plant but if you cultivate it becomes a perennial and from all the information we have if you start to go out into the laden Plains there were very large areas where this was harvested and it was a field of white flowers I see yellow flowers and this is the sort of work that we want to do with them this is about if you are successful what will you do with the title what will you do with the title over the next four years one of the elements that we 'll be doing is is working with the judge and run to roll out this country plan and respect to the food system the second element of our application is that this is about creativity itself and I 'll use a couple of great examples perhaps examples of wouldn 't come readily to mine so in this region HB Makai roundel more invented the combine harvester it absolutely changed agriculture now obviously our client site we have cleared too much country and planted too much we 've week and grow hain and so on but we did that invention in 1858 the Bendigo pottery was established it 's the oldest continuous pottery in Australia what 's it going to do in gastronomy they 've been making the things we need to eat and drink with at the moment they 're supplying 17 of Australia 's 15 most highly recognized restaurants with their the dinner way so here 's a of the things and it 's great that talk we had on me he 's got some community garden and the work that Stephanie Alexander 's done in that space in in having a look at and talking with other cities around the world and a series of gastronomy this kitchen garden idea within a school we have known it just about better than anyone else we can find around the world and I 'll be interested to hear from Stephanie later if this is this the case certainly when ice I 've spoken to people in Italy and swim and newest we 're not getting that sort of evidence that that 's as advanced as we are here the third pillar is around health and well-being and this is directly follows on from really what Vickie was talking about in other speakers all the things that we have been talking about what we 're doing is trying to tackle the issues of nutrition or form part of the application the ongoing role and the last pillar is climate change and if you think about this is I think this the 21st century but in terms of looking at gastronomy and looking at the third system this is about restoring a food system and it really takes us right back to that indigenous history how do we build a sustainable food system in an era of climate change our more stressed environment food miles all those issues they will come back with Slumberland circles UNESCO has embraced the 17 goals the 17 sustainably now sustainable development goals and so our application is build around the theme of sustainability so I 'll leave it there and happy to talk to anyone over lunch or later today about the aspects you 'd like to hear more about [Applause] _"

    "text": "thank you very much Amy we had some technical issues in that my other style of presentation reformatted itself and it doesn 't all fit into the screen so we 've got the pdf version so I 'll be lucky we 've got varying forms of technology so here 's some general done and the head that I 'm wearing today is as the chair of the Bendigo regional food alliance I 'm not sure everyone in the room is familiar with the Bendigo regional food alliance does anyone not well that 's a good start right and so what I 'm going to do is actually just give a really broad brushstroke around the background of how we got to get being the Bendigo regional food Alliance and and looking at Bendigo speed system the we look right back to historically vinegars food system and we 've got you know a history of indigenous food system obviously but then there 's been the Chinese settlement and the richness that that culture brought the Spanish settlers and more Tomatoes in Bendigo there 's a range of things when we moved food co-op pretty often so you know we joined that was booming but in the last decade there 's been probably a revival of interest in a range of what we would call community food system activities and people are very familiar with you know community gardens around you going for quite some time there 's varying Telly 's of how many there are are you talking to with that scum also richness of I 've got the words refugee garden as the Korean community in particular be familiar with e the object on Hill particularly in Quarry Hill but also at the Salvation Army with the gravel hill gardeners where the Korean community are doing a lot of getting their hands dirty and growing terrific culturally appropriate foods which comes into our discussion about food security later on because it 's culturally appropriate food we have what are having what up there is pepper green fun now that 's actually on the side of a Chinese market garden and there 's a great history there and so there 's the scale that can come with from small individual plots 's a farmers market obviously and that 's been growing and the the extension of the farmers market is something that 's been looked at over a period of time so pleased to see that extending into a twice a month initiative now Bob Skeens people might be familiar with those again different ways of accessing local foods and then the different initiatives to support our food system so people might be familiar with food for seekers which is around the support for the more the commercial and the industry and producers and then initiatives that have stemmed from there such as the from market to paddock to plate to through popular one but some have to me who 's here might be very pleased to speak to about it but just another way of bringing people into connection with where their food comes from school kitchen gardens we 're going to hear a bit more about later and there 's a large number of those and with her connection and through the food alliance with those indigo Food Share and to build the border FoodShare so that something that affordable and healthy food is a big issue and we do waste an enormous amount of food so this is a number of angles to a food system work that food shares work touches on and then there 's the pet project of mine which is edible indigo which is around getting everybody infused about growing food in Bendigo a lot of the work that 's been done in Bendigo of course comes from data that shows some you know this data can always be updated but the essentials of 41 percent of households are on income of less than 400 a week and when we talk about emergency food relief in particular we know that we 've got people who are classified as working poor so not necessarily a stereotype of who we might feel is requiring assistance to eat a healthy diet the food insecurity states of course placed greater bendigo above the state average well and truly that record was nine point four percent compared with five point six the stats differ on overweight and obesity I think it 's higher than fifty three percent but and to say there 's a growing trend and a huge looming health issue with regards to the respectives that obesity and overweight future and that 's underpinned also at times by the fact that 58 percent of people don 't make the recommended daily intake for fruit and ninety-one percent don 't meet the daily vegetable intake keeps coming up is the same type of statistic it hasn 't changed very much over quite a period of time and just to top it off if welcome to Bendigo but people in the region died on average three point five years earlier than Metro so this work came as Amyas mentioned the healthy together Bendigo initiative so we 're talking about work over six years or so longer and of course that came out of the healthy communities work nationally and then a series of initiatives that followed through so the food for thought research paper you know back in 2013 2013 we had a food for him which was attended by another terrific day an opportunity for people to bring out their ideas and those ideas were captured and then basis of a lot of work through Council and part of that the healthy together initiative was the healthy food connect and you 'll see well you probably can 't see there but your slides that part of the the thinking with that healthy food connect connect aspect of healthy together work was the establishment of through coalition 's something that if you 're in the u.s. you might prefer Policy Council or here networks coalition 's alliances whatever it is it 's still the same way of bringing people together to try and create some great outcomes around food system and then out of that it was the funding was discontinued when the National preventative health agency was defunded in Canberra then that work folded and the food Alliance became a standalone Association so we received some startup funding in terms of some assistance to establish some branding through from Council and at that stage [Music] we 've got some good-looking branding you 'll notice the Flyers over there and so you know since working together to grow healthy communities and and the core tagline is grow source cook of those areas we have a website website as an interactive website with a Google Maps facility we were thinking big there 's lots of opportunities to add resources to it and to put events etc on the website and people are welcome to log in and use it for that function whether you want to identify community gardens access to emergency food relief a range of community whatever it is there 's some categories there and they can be expanded as time goes on these things only work if people use them so we encourage people to make use of that website as much as possible we 've had a range of activity so might have seen us at the Bendigo community farmers market over the previous over a year until earlier this year would be popping up once a month there with a food swap and the premise of that was around people understanding seasonality of food sharing and abundance and also the and so anyway the food swap also working with some of our local food say local schools with seedlings that were grown with their Department ever seen they weaken boxes around town and the weakened boxes were part of a initial initiative which was a funding big give crowdfunding and then there was a council grant for water wise gardening and education around food growing and we also us a group called vinegar rich and fruit fly who received funding through AG fig and with the fruit fly situation there 's a whole talk involved with there but that will also the work they 've been doing to train people with crooning to manage their trees fruit trees will actually stand as well in moving forward into a harvest program there 's been a lot of forums and reports and this the the forum that was happening in 2012 and I came back into Bendigo from working at cultivating community was the growers majors forum so they 're 150 people at that there 's all along it 's been people ready to be involved I suppose the shorthand of all of these different initiatives forums and feasibility studies things like food hub feasibility study because there 's plans for obviously for a food hub but and the food security and agriculture work and a piece of work that I 've just mentioned which is the it 's quite a statewide groundbreaking piece of work was the state of Greater Bendigo so local food economy pilot study and that was actually again interviewing and talking to many stakeholders the feasibility study had done to get a sense of what the economic drivers are around our local food system right down to the domestic scale where we had surveys of people 's back you know production and value adding and how people are using their food from that level right up to the big producers who might be turning over up to two hundred million dollars worth of a value-added product from the margin and agribusiness so I 'll just finish off with the pigment project because Helen referred to that the coming year will have the people might have been aware there was a process for people my project funded 30 million dollars from the department premiere in cabinet some time back and so people voted according to a range of initiatives that were put forward brought together a group of people from a range of backgrounds with the concept of creating cooking clubs and as I mentioned our areas have grown sheer cooking sauce the cook part was one of our strategic objectives for this year because we felt that we had talked about growing and we talked about sharing but certainly the the cooking part the food literacy that the health outcomes that can be achieved by people improving their their knowledge about not just nutrition but actually just what to do with food once they 've grown themselves or received it in various ways and various types of food it 's an essential life skill and a lot of people don 't have it so working with the food Alliance Food Share Salvation Army Caliban water with Sonia Anthony is our chef overseer and with Bendigo can get in TAFE justice building a garden extra garden beds at the Salvation Army will be establishing these programs in six locations and that 's a good start obviously aimed at the demographic of people who are going to have benefit from that most recruited two which currently might have community meals there 'll be a skills development along the minds of a let 's get cooking program that 's been run in the UK very successfully and developed to the point where they can run those programs themselves and participate without the chef mentoring and then the other aspect will be a role that we 'll be assisting particularly with food share around the procurement of food somebody who 's been on the agenda they 're needed for a long time around access or procurement of healthy local produce so we hope that that proceeded successfully unfortunately the food Alliance we actually didn 't factor in any funding for the coordination of the project so as with the remainder of activities it 's all voluntary and yeah that can be a bit of a problem so my final point there being that we have a lot of bility we have mailing list of over 60 people we 've got dozens of members we have a range of different opportunities for people to get together and bring forward their ideas for projects and activities and I we have input into policy we 've had input into alliances and networks further afield one who are around cetera and into other initiatives and so we look forward to that continuing there is a an IRC project coming up with sustain who undertook the discovery grant with Sydney University on the role of local government in strengthening food systems and they 'll be doing three case studies for Victoria and three for New South Wales so I 've my fingers crossed that we might be one of the case study so we 'll have to watch this space [Applause] _"

    "text": "and you 're going to talk to us about [Music] this this presentation is used as a fundraiser so at the end of talks about Kings money FoodShare exists because we know that we live in a land of plenty we can produce way more food than our population can eat but still there are people that live in poverty breakfast program for kids that come to school and I have to tell you a story here about I was reported by a teacher a little boy who came to school every Monday morning absolutely starving and would regularly eat half a loaf of bread made into toasted Vegemite and the teacher said to him one day wow you 've got a really good appetite what 's your favorite food and he said I the thing I love best is some SAP Sood and the teacher said Oh Sam soup I 've never heard of that how do you make that and he said we have it every Friday night mum and dad gone by seven a roll they come home and put the seven and saucepan cook it up delicious and you think what is he eating there water and salt so he doesn 't even know he 's living in food poverty of course and everybody will know these statistics and they 're mostly related to your ability to earn an income [Music] so they 're in more danger of food poverty I won 't read the map but I 'm sure you all know that the other thing that food chair is quite passionate about is rescuing food that goes to waste because all of the food from food that food share has is food that is destined for waste so we distributed throughout quite a Britta large area in Victoria right up to a checker across to a fogger down to content and to a whole lot of schools a lot of schools that run program cooking programs and in particular programs we give to charities and community groups usually community houses that run not cooking programs but they provide meals and we see food is a great kind of enabler I can tell you a story from Santa boringness that have food for our from program a couple of times a week and the innovative lady cook didn 't want to waste any leftover food so she started cooking extra meals to give to families that she knew were hungry and some of those parents came into school and said oh actually YUM how did you make that it was delicious and she said well come on in and I 'll show you how to cook so they 've now got this fantastic social grouping going on where they 're teaching people to cook using the food from food chair and they 're helping to feed families that kind of afford to eat healthy food in Bendigo so when you collectively take up how many people are assisted there 's eight thousand eight hundred people every week that get food through Food Share so some of those charity other charity groups make it into food packages to give to people that are in need food chair runs on a shoestring we rent a very large warehouse in havelaar Road part of it is a cool store and part of it is a freezer it costs we have to pay all the ongoing costs associated with the rental and the power for a huge power bill as you can imagine we just had solar panels installed to hopefully offset that power bill and we only employ two part-time people and the rest of the work of future is done by volunteers it 's not funded by the government we do it 's run entirely by donations we get food from Food Bank which is funded by the government but we don 't receive any funding at all and over the year we calculate that we rescue six thousand three hundred thirty two tons of food that would go to into the landfill so when you think about the effort that 's gone into the production of that food one of the mathematicians on the board has done all this work he reckons that prevents 78,000 kilometres of water being wasted through that yes so the community groups that we work with their community houses that prepare for meals and the other community groups are mostly charitable organizations that prepare food packages for people and we like they offer a financial counseling service they can get people in for you know a 3-month financial counselling service and they say to them okay you can get free food from us and that will save you the money so that you can pay off those bills that you 've got so we were increasingly trying to do that so that the food becomes and incense for people to make some changes in their life to enable them to live in a more kind of sustainable way so we see that it 's really important and we figure that for every dollar that 's donated we can provide 16 meals so every dollar goes to provide meals for 16 people so it 's pretty good value for money and it 's not just um you know for people in crisis so well there are kind of those people there 's another story about a woman one of our people were collecting and a woman came to give a 5 donation and she said I I really feel like I 'm doing this as payback because she is a single parent job so then she was on a miserable Centrelink benefit and paying petrol to take her child death backwards and forwards to Melbourne and she obviously had no money so she used food share for that period in her life and she wanted to pay back so they 're the kinds of people that lose future and I 'm sorry there 's only one minute for questions there are any questions we hope there 'll be some dollars no no it 's not yeah Food Bank you know the agency 's food banks second bite us harvest they 're all funded by the government and food bank I think well they we get food from all of them which obviously we don 't pay for and they pay for the transport for it to the indigo as well but we don 't get any direct funding from the government so we really exist on donations and philanthropic grants so yes yes fifty percent of the food is rescued likely and fifty percent we get from those other agencies so we have great relationships with hazel Dean 's the supermarkets tip-top constant challenges is to get to get food that is still going to waste and soften process prepared food but the logistics of how you would kind of get that and get it to people immediately we haven 't figured that out so when you can 't sleep at night you might like to do that because the kind of people you know that needed don 't have email places greatly if we could get caterers you know involved in somehow rather giving us their food needed to go no the shed could can we could have double as much and general Dan 's going to talk next we 're teaming up with Jen 's Berg grow the Bendigo root regional food Alliance because they 've got a big project to teach people how to cook so we are totally committed to providing food to those groups because we see that as being one of the really essential things because we know that sometimes when people are given the food packages they take out all the fresh vegetables and say we don 't want those you don 't know how _''_594.029 a bag of potatoes so encouraging people not only to learn to cook but to understand that that kind of food is way healthier than about the for us and chips that would please us immensely too so we 're really happy to be joining up with them [Music] [Applause] _"

    "text": "so I 'll just give you a little introduction about how I came into this program and heated up primary school I was contacted I 'm a my background is garden designer and horticulture and food and I was approached by Heath the primary school Cindy Bruce head was starting the Stephanie Alexander program and they are applying for funding and needed a garden design to go in with their package so I came in on board with that so that was the first time I 'd heard about Stephanie Alexander school the kitchen garden program I then a couple of years went by and I took a gap year and the school approached me to come in as a volunteer just in the garden side of it which I did and then suddenly I was running the program and teaching kitchen and garden so it was kind of a big job that sort of went in at the deep end and I 'm still there so five years down the track that program is still running and it 's absolutely fabulous the benefits of this program no doubt Stephanie our little school at Heathkit is that it introduces children and families who probably have very little background in food food preparation etc and introduces them to growing their own food harvesting cooking and absolutely loving what they make so our program runs from now runs from kinder through to grade six Cindy left and we have a new principals and case Ballantine is just a fabulous supporter of this program it 's quite expensive to run but we have Bendigo Bank helps us out there and as does food chair and also some of the families this is really important for children particularly those kids who don 't shine academically they can shine in the garden and kitchen program we have an absolutely amazing catering crew and some of those kids that are on the spectrum are awesome uploading everything up sending out things that are absolutely perfect also the gardening side of attention as those children that this is where our food comes from when I first started there one little boy had harvested some grass and brought it into kitchen and said could he put it in are you going to make you said milk probably not so that was kind of some of the background some of the kids were coming from we now after this program running for seven years have some amazing cooks one of our number one volunteers are here today Linda Thank You Linda originally came from the Stephanie Alexander garden program in Collinwood and we were lucky enough a couple of years in that she came in and said could she volunteer yes yes you can deliver and she brought with her a whole stack of information and knowledge and you would probably notice the difference in the kids since the start so probably at the start the kids their food knowledge but also talent was 70% wouldn 't try foods that they 'd never tried before now I 'm really happy to say it 's around about 97 percent that the kids will try everything there 's a couple of kids that are a little bit difficult but peer pressure normally works with them so just recently we cooked food from all over the world our classes have that the food so it 'll stuff with entree and go right through to desert we also cook food from all over the world so really difficult cuisines so Japanese we 've just had food festivals so which has been a carnival festival which culminated in cooking of foods from Mexico from Indonesia and also from Madagascar so we had that on yesterday so every child in the school cooked so we had 19 people cooking through the cloth and it rolled out over the morning and the end result was a feast which every child and any other parents and volunteers were involved in so it was absolutely fantastic the big kids mental the little ones so we had the grain five six kids mentoring the foundation great one and two and teaching them how to use a very sharp chefs knives etc no accidents I have to say very proud of ourselves so not only does this teach the children about food and about how to grow it and how to cook it and enjoy it it also gives them some other skills so it teaches them about responsibility we them that if they don 't look after the animals and our garden then there 's nothing to eat so everyone is involved in in looking after those that teaches an organization the kids have to organize themselves I had virtually hands-off with the kids now and they organized everything from the moment they get into putting on their aprons washing hands etc right through to doing dishes and the dishes are all done manually so everybody gets a go at washing dry and putting away and cleaning up the work area and they surely not somebody else went over it also teaches them teamwork they 've got to work as a team it teaches you manners and respect for each other some of the kids when they first come into the program come from backgrounds where they don 't sit at a table or eat with knives and forks so that goes right through to that to using napkins sharing food making sure that they serve other people first rather than themselves and sitting down and having a conversation at the table which is really important it teaches them it 's if you put a seed in and that 's not the right season it doesn 't grow so if some of those things happen within the garden and it teaches the kids what happens in the season part of this was a knock-on effect that not only was that teaching the children about cooking growing their food that was a knock on to the families as well so I was approached by some of the parents the kids were coming home who were fabulous cooks and wanting to make their food that they had cooked at school for the family and of course some of those families had no cooking skills they approached me to see if I could show them how to cook some of the food some of the menus but also how to stock their pantry with basics and what did they do with that food and I think that was mentioned through all of the speakers was how to prepare the food is really important there 's been a big gap of people missing out on school cooking so they 've come if I taught at school then they miss out they 're doing the best they can they 're buying prepared food and sometimes frozen food and they 're not killing their families but they 're not helping them either so part of that was that we started cooking classes for the families and we called it running your household on a shoestring but we did everything right from basic so giving them a budget teaching them how to stock a pantry what to buy and how to buy cheaply and then we started to teach them how to make basic food so some of the basics were bread basic meals stop what to do we if we make stock from a chicken what we else we can use the chicken for and we had seven meals out of that one chicken including the stock that they froze and then continued on it was a six week course I 've since run the same course at California gulley primary school and really successful and it is teaching people about basics because it 's not that they don 't have enthusiasm for that for 't want to waste their food so this has been such a wonderful program and I can 't have used the analogy that it 's about giving your children memories and I know when I was a little girl some of my memories were of walking into the kitchen after school and smelling food cooking so and in the middle of winter coming in and there was a beautiful pot of soup on the stove and that 's what we had after school it was healthy it was delicious but it also they are my food memories that I 'm sure that they will be in these children 's food memories so [Applause] _"

    "text": "we have 10 campuses across Victoria and Charleston one is our main campus for food and fiber as well as abroad medics I 'll give you a bit of a background as to why this is here back in 2014 the state government gave Bendigo TAFE and hang an institute a 7.8 million dollar take rescue fund to build a center of excellence here in Bendigo so but the center of excellence is not just about building these if you 're building and the students love it but it 's also about our other campuses and what we can do with those it 's about our people our course offerings we 've got we 've invested a significant amount of money in that digitalized courseware which we 're currently working through with one of our other businesses within the TAFE that works and that gives students remote access to be able to do curriculum as well as coming here and doing at practical skills and demonstrate those within the centre eridan okay so this is our vision for the center of excellence in particularly for food and fiber we believe their ideal job our vision is actually quite a succinct one and put simply we 're aiming to deliver vocational education and training that 's comprehend that comprehensively represents the food and fiber sector in addition to the training we 're building strong relationship with industry partners and to order in order to understand the contemporary and future needs of the industry as well as creating stronger pathways for our students so these are the six areas that we currently look cover within the food and fiber center of excellence and it 's the pinnacle oh sorry and building on already strong relationships and links with industry and promising delivery in the food and fiber production this is our third center of excellence within vki we 've also got a health and community center of excellence which most of you probably would have seen on the corner of coming with us right now and also automotive centre of excellence at Docklands the food and fiber food and fiber sector underwent a radical overhaul just a few years ago to emerge from a niche market to more expansive vision of new state and federal governments in this sector we 've got free TAFE courses next year in the spaces of horticulture in agriculture and our see our center of excellence covers four of those courses certificate two and three and water culture and certificate for three and four in agriculture and these are the new and emerging areas so part of the business case that was developed around building the center of excellence and looking at a course or in curriculum we spoke to a lot of people out in industry and these areas are identified so we 'll seek to deliver in these emerging areas particularly around agriculture sustainability including resource management biosecurity animal welfare agribusiness and urban planning and new food production and supply systems and the broader technical development we 're also looking at a lot of work with institute of drone technology in the drone flights as well as the data analysis that sits behind that so with this strategy we 're confident we can address the needs of the food and fiber sector in our regions now and well into the future ok this is sort we will check chivell vision by focusing on the these six approaches however our confidence in our ability to deliver is not just based on the future developments it 's our people our industry partnerships and our training partnerships we actually belong to a regional TAFE collaboration where all the regional tastes work collaboratively together to provide opportunities for students around curriculum development and also practical placement opportunities and then this is around our collaboration our industry partnerships are the focal point as we strive to deliver the best education outcomes possible by making our collaborative industry vision a reality we have the training expertise at Bendigo Canyon Institute but we need close ties with the industry to be able to leave our vocational expertise they have we 've created two industry advisory boards one for our Metro campuses and one for our regional campuses and not sure if anyone in the room is part of that but we have quite a number we 've got a great mix across all the six sectors and I spoke about earlier on and the objectives of the industry advisory board are really advice on future workforce and training development needs for the food and fiber sector to identify it and monitor the emerging trends across the food and fiber industry sectors to identify the related skills and knowledge required to meet the demands arising from the emerging trends to provide advice on areas of specialization that will respond to current and emerging needs and to provide relevant advice back to external stakeholders and key decision-makers regarding future development and also to provide an industry perspective on the development and use of our centers of excellence as well as the work that we 'll be doing in our other campuses and that impacts our flexible and innovative approaches to training within the centre to complement with where place center processes and learning environment to help create a vibrant and exciting Center serving the needs of learners the industry in the community [Applause] _"

    "text": "same just sit down get Mike sorted it 's like oh damn should be 0 150 feet that 's quite sure when I was going to get up I 've told you I have Jonathan riddle riddle yesterday morning and before us to go on here here I would sit in the flyer that I showed you earlier and then you see a man cooks you do not beat chunk to deal with their how to do it we 've been via the flyer is it well actually I was only snapshot a few is if I thought you were say that so there there will be multiple areas covered in our conversation and I hope Travis presentation you to really get what understanding that nearly everything that we do some way shape or form is going to affect our environmental footprint how we upheld we impact on our environment so moving on Catherine the Trevor thanks for joining a groom to join with us today what we 're going to do is each of the panel members it is i 'll introduce the members give you a short from opportunities in at five minutes it was taking online what Trevor 's talk to you about some other things that I would like to add to the conversation so I 'm going to actually start with Evan and every day because I hadn 't done million until today I thought was going to be young somebody else going in for you and with it has been nominated for there you go sustainability group so we were discovered they the healing power of food but his mother was diagnosed with or cancer change to diet and saw a dramatic change in health and there 's a passion to educate people the relationship between our food and our health was born every experimented with organic food production 111 1 acre in Eaglehawk before creating a community education project gravel hill gardens with John fairly familiar with which demonstrated the principles of organic growing permaculture and sustainable food production ever saw the need for affordable organic produce in central Victoria so established businesses an organic green grocer and the business is now Victoria 's biggest retailer again produce outside of Melbourne however it 's representing base Jim home today so good evening first of all like to say to be counseled this is a great initiative to get these boards happening for us to be able to talk about issues that are important and if I guess hats off to you that we 're doing this great thing I 'm sure thanks very much for your talk I wanted to tell a brief story actually which I was inspired to hear some of your field stories back in nineteen ninety nine it was actually shown as don 't lose type of the dreadful project fell apart of it the project goals part of was playing on fifteen thousand trees on the south-facing slopes of people at that entrance to the Sree I get to look at those trees growing as I come back for mark waiting and see how he counting the pinnacle of that project that we did was to have a train from melbourne with thousand people i stopped in the middle of the paddock I 've done having beer eh let 's do that and all these people came up the university students there was environmental groups that all got involved it was funded through the Olympic blanket project which was money for making Australia or pre for weather revealing his came the experience was was that we had thousand people get off his train really really keen and eager to help the environment so my team we help them plant those trees but the interesting part of the story is for the next month after that day we replanted a lot of trees it just though we had a thousand willing people they weren 't gets killed so I think this kind of undertaking we 're all very clean we all want to see changes in our CD we just don 't know how to do it yet and that 's what we need guidance from our community I encouraged to counsel to the Newman community we 've got a lot of experts on ecological notice environment on that ISM and certainly in the BS cheap as I 've been involved in that group quite astounded at some of the folks too involved and and their skill levels and so I think with the best cheap and been quite evolved with the scene I cheaply with the solar projects we 've got community be involved and we 're going to we going to achieve some things I 've even a couple of big nights just in response to some notes that I had from Trevor before he 's taught and that was around how we 're disconnected from the forest disconnected from nature and I thought I just share a few of those things that I saw how we 're disconnected from nature in the past people fed themselves from the forest now a little food we eat comes from China in the past our furniture was made with fine Timbers growing our own forests now our furniture is made out of MDF in China in the past a lot of our leisure time was spent outdoors enjoying the forests the parks and even our own backyards but now is spend leisure time on our devices which are made in China it 's tongue-in-cheek but it 's it 's the truth we we 've outsourced their own supplying your and and as was mentioned by by triple beep we have the resources locally to provide for own communities and I think we should really take on the challenge of getting that happy at this point she also like to acknowledge the work that PSG do do and the partnership the ceiling joists with that proof and particularly third forum based Jean have provided a lot of English and provided a lot of assistance to us all in developing that red roof power form and there are numerous events and activities that go on that we enjoy partnering and support him I think crisply team to catch up just about one support the moment so it 's a terrific partnership so thank you an extra ten is Roland Hogan Rowand has over 20 years professional experience in wire growing and natural resource management areas including river health environmental flows land and water management solidity management water policy Roman was responsible to develop in rural central gradual catchment strategy and war way strategies is currently developing a natural resource amendment climate change planning for the region bridal rings brings his extensive thanks wrong thank you so the same I basically take that a bit of a broader regional perspective on things so it 's not just about the sea there you go but what I thought I to talk a little bit about tonight is around our climate change adaptation reduction plan which is really about thinking about the environment thinking about climate change but also need about people because we can 't do any of this without without people i think that 's be a Greek lee message from not just food so what we 've done is how that process we 've been working and this is a plan it 's about 53 in our own bodies live safe like the north central CA around Australia so we 've been working with Cesaro targets and update your climate change directions and that 's been these the ones being used in that latest IPCC report that was released recently unfortunately where it 's saying though isn 't really great reading so just very like a couple of things that we 're expected to see over the next or next little all seasons we 'll have more hot days and warm spells fuel but possibly more damaging for us by about 29 we 're likely to see less capable and cool seasons but we 're also likely to see a the intensity of rainfall so increasing intensity where does rain will likely see harsh reply with a condition so it 's probably not great the projections of prolly same things are going to get pretty difficult for us now obviously that a lot of the projections are based on a lot of data but also a lot of assumptions and a lot of assumptions of able to happen in the future so there 's a fair bit of uncertainty there so they 're like and some of the match the web use did our painting display them to what a high emission scenario invading English emission scenario so just to keep the scarier llywydd Soho editions no we 're currently tracking on damages we 're looking by 2092 have increased instance for this is a regional projection increases of the 20th at 2.7 degrees to 4.5 degrees Celsius so it 's and the environment so it 's potentially got implications and rainfall potentially putting day dress like that twenty cents in but course increase when I 'm santanico reflects there 's feel about certainty and helpings of nothing 's of with their projections some of the threats are we 're thinking about in terms of the briman so our plan is really about their Brian and how people interact with that so obviously the juice rainfall increased temperatures has some direct impacts on some of the things that important to us so rivers and wetlands like that have a lot less water which obviously will have a huge impact on our quad economic ecosystem and vegetation is likely to be changed the composition in vegetation as things get can 't really handle to let you know let 's plan for Chris temperature so we 're going to see some changes in the environment that we see so the direct impacts indirect impacts also really important so potential changes in land use so agricultural and other other land uses might change depending on what happens with climate so and that will have to be an impact too so whatever things really about is thinking about both medication reduction so mitigation is about how do we reduce our emissions so some things like the the lights LED lights is fantastic what our family tries to do is think about there will be playing carbon trees in the landscape to get high diversity outcomes so it 's about kind of TV it 's about increasing brennan 's oh stop being so what our plan is really about is trying to encourage people to actually help the environment kind of get through some of this climate change but also provide simulation so some of that some of the things that you know beastly topic or Trevor said no we all share this problem climate change and with them going to have to contribute to it so I think that 's really important and I suppose some of the adaptation one of those approaches that we 're taking as part of our plan is really around capacity building I think you might have talked about it it 's about got a lot of people out there to deal with the problem and I think that 's going to be really important you know technology looking at technology transfers education communication demonstrations putting the community networks and the other things that happen really important our engagement be really important thinking about how might link to the product strategy about how can we think about planning in a different way thinking about not planning now that you 're planning for a much reduced water rainfall what does that mean for our rural areas and our lifestyle and hobby hobby a hobby farms so those type of things might need to be considered so one of the life lessons on talk about is we just recently developed a study with Charles de indias around social clubs in rem so what we 've done is gone out across our region and asked about 200 questions around the environment and we 've got about a home response packs we 've got these wealth of information about what landholders particularly their holes with a their greater than 10 hectares or not necessary urban urban dwellers but we 've got a really good and it gives us really good information around what they 're thinking and what they know and don 't know and how that might happen might even formula approach to dealing with some issues that were gone so think i 'll live it we 've got some information on see greater bendigo specifically as well so we can really kind of drill down a little bit and understand what that means or you know rule and hollis we can see right then you 're going to have a my powder I 'll link that into the environment Thank from the other day I had a quick look at some of that survey information and the differences that came up between the responses from the Asia video area compared to some of the other municipalities was was tight start so we we are peculiar if not if nothing else at finals bakery is cash instead of asking a Catherine is our sustainable environment advisor community a representative on the panel today Catherine is a community member of that committee Catherine 's nuclear and go 14 years and there 's the mother akina parents me and the huntley Congress school council there you go area appeals to Catherine because of the surrounding bushland and the climate and loves you has a country field that 's not too far from the big ego city center having to spend time with their family gardening and working on environment as an environment project officer managing the delivery of environmental water to wet lands within the knowledge info catchment Joe so thank you Catherine so I 'm going to talk about me in mind of all government of the world that either can be three kids that one goes to school one go stick in no one 's a child care sometimes ones at home and other people 's kids in my life is kind of crazy and and I do feel really lucky to live worthy I grew up in frankston urban sprawl I might miss the beach a little bit but I really do like what an ego has to offer I really do lovely be an ugly you know the forest one block away from my house a short walk or a scooter the bush we 're watching the bottles crowd and you know we 're getting out where 's my chocolate lilies it 's just a fabulous place to be but in the short time I guess that since my oldest son was going on I really watched touch of the vegetation in my area been removed can change to make way for roads and housing estates replaced by us streetscape kind of planting people 's crazy balance full of competitors in English box and I used to working and you know those days people I would stay afloat as a nursery because never buy that ultimately while the truly one of those green markets that I used to really stop and admire all my son in the story is proud more women for a walk so you know I do feel overwhelmed by the rate of the development of the new estates and those daily plan seeing you you know replaced by praising plants and street lighting for the lights that are turned on even before these ain 't even got a house in if you know one day the only know than me know the soil disturbance and azaleas turned up in my son go to Yvonne have a pretty flat out of like oh now you go to semo is this the way to do what this one so I I just so you know I watch this development of housing estates and I 've just made three days and I 'm contributing to that problem possibly because I 'm going to live for love and instead but you know I 'm afraid in that demand for that housing estate just as much as everyone else 's but don 't think about my house and I think that the stuff that i have in my house and I just have stuff you know I bought stuff in my kids because I 've got Benny that people came with stuff and they bought more stuff I give himself as I hear it 's the right thing to do I don 't want stuff I don 't have to clean up the stuff that keeps getting with all around my house my garden he 's full of Cecil lives and rocks you know a say anything we 've got a veggie patch though I using the things it should be playing with you know train tracks and I go stuff you know they 've got their lives but you know we only need a few of those things I don 't need you should provide price plastic stuff somehow it 's in my home it 's everywhere I don 't know what I 'm going to do with it then I go to the supermarket and there 's more stuff and they say here have some dominoes free have a card about how it 's really good to great urge DeVos and then they want to have like the kids in the town movie they want to swap them and share them if people want more of them and so I have more stuff flying around my house that I talk more the no one really wants that you can giving it to us soon as I would feel like we should take it i want it anyway so I preparing for what I was gonna say tonight I was reminded is 17 million dreams on planet consumed with care and that 's been previously mentioned you know there 's so many people on this earth that have nothing but I have a house for lots of stuff that really is nothing and I don 't think I really couldn 't agree more but they consumed with care quite a kind of thing but that said you know tomorrow yesterday I pop down to bullies and I made that choice of being one of those people that 's part of that continuous problem of shopping in a place that doesn 't have this ankle conscience even though I 'm areas that in the world and I know that locally Bendigo has an issue be playing feel all these things that we keep collecting so I feel frustrated at myself for how disconnected i am and that we all love with the effects that I have on on nature those seemingly normal actions really do have a huge impact on our environment and so I 'm sounding really negative and I probably and I was away because I 'll be really quick the enormity of all of that stuff you know we 've talked about that today population growth climate change waste management etc but there really are some positive means that you can do that I think I do sometimes to be part of a solution to try and make a change my kids are really lucky they go to busch kingdom so you know I 've got this fantastic opportunity for the kids to play in the washing and fantastic learning environment where all they use is that child you know what a wonderful way to set up children for the future that 's real passionate about the bush like they are you can contribute to things like the Bendigo residential development strategy by just going online and filling out a form and saying what parts of it you agree with and what parts you drawing so you can be involved actively that way and I really like some of the aspects of the Vindico residential development strategy we 're not looking to expand all the footprint that keep within you know the area that 's already made upon us think we can keep those areas of those green orchids were leave them there in the housing estate doing around them but you know it 's the positive steps towards that and I guess I 've just found that generally being an active member in my community makes me feel better about what happens in the environment through the huntley kinder where petition to get a feminine sing on the midland highway that 's a way that we can address some of that I mean this is it crossing there already but you know for the rest of the time of day we can reduce the amount of traffic that 's on the road by making it much safer and easier for us to get around in our community and I think by doing those small things you are contributing without always getting overwhelmed by the enormity of everything else so when you go to the shops you know do I need those Domino is no you really don 't and use these type of flora to get involved and focus on some things that your national without and you all relate to that any of those lessons on Rovers focus and things like that just right and I my life and I said on the border there 's no reuse day I can avoid something for it to be reusable someday come to the outline of what I do need to reuse it so they do to a to the power members never we 're going to turn to your needs to you for questions and then you might to start the ball rolling the question Japan release crushing betrayal you said that we all need to share and prove that I 'm just wondering what kind of scope and councils have to use economic instruments because not everyone out there wants to be my files penalties and fees are charged piercings and the chart right so all these things could be manipulated to encourage people have used operations let 's say that happy very much the level of Gregory bags but major honours transformation just working the stroke is very difficult question I can 't_''_1454.79 do what does she is it is it 's up there with just ah the in actual fact what I was saying that was it 's a huge influence on what we spend money on and I 'm not going to give you any specific examples but other than to say the example of Robin coated about the lighting and regency project just represent us how we can actually readjust our expenditure and make huge impacts in Darrin 's area of become aware that one of the staff to darren 's area is actually potentially saved the council nearly 20 million dollars over 20 years simply by looking at a totally different way of an environmental issue associated with the tip and I suppose it does sort of reflect what I was trying to say that that there are ways in which we can actually look at the same problem in different way and that 's what I was trying to say with mendigo that we I think can we reach our expenditure collectively a hundred thousand people with their expenditure even a relatively small amount could make a substantial difference and and I think that 's the challenge for the environmental strategy agree I am a dancer that I reckon we 'll uncover it all that 's highlighted the importance there he goes for us to the livability and indigo the state government is trying to destroy those forests with their fuel reduction benign to destroy five percent of the first I all the forest certainty peers by diminishing with this revenge because I think it 's on what can the count will do or what is the council to count here in your space modernize the end of that I have to be able to regrow mindful here um is it there 's no doubt about it the fuel reduction verdes a tricky process for Atlas mountain areas no doubt about it at all and I think that 's one of the challenges that lovely as a city are going to have to think about and work out how do we work out how do we get the protection that we need and we have a from fire from wildfire and also maintained a very element that makes the city what it is that see in the iris so I hear and in this very email dr. year where you actually have listed as fuel reduction though it seems it does affect significantly on our health of our part and that 's not the comprehensive answer what we watching you to be junior yet I guess what we find that you need to think about all that with other other areas started to talk around campus I realized frequently together in Northwest that waxy stubborn man and still my insistence Toby burning some high character boss Repertory Theater is that they 're challenging cooking from as many diseases out of it and take it hang on something wrong and it 's taken out me probably a few degrees for us to understand that realize that which is the problem and I think that there are things changing that foot that have to be worked through because even internal to live the government payments and working out that the solution of the thought we had isn 't properly the solution in debt privy referred to it your presentation layer with the comparison of a microcosm or mental authority or pilots face that what could be done that 's innovative ready to go in that sort of space well I I didn 't make mention of the Bendigo metro rail project but and some people maybe you know under attention about what that 's about but essentially it 's about saying how can we utilize the resources we 've got if you wear to rebuild the railway system in there you go I guess we 'll be talking for five hundred million volts of time you bought or land your track record stations signal inside now that 's not going to solve our internal transport problems but in actual fact what it does is attentional e shift a number of people increasing number of people on the rails and even if it only means that every day that brought we get is more training between here and orbit that 's West Karthik traveling here in Melbourne at our interesting element of the metro rail project is the emphasis of emerged from some of the discussions with Kaitlyn last few days might help you and humbly the last six or seven years the City maps and the response of the government generally pay TV coverage ask what Victoria particularly is to take that off now we keep living on the map we had a breakthrough last week they actually said we 've given up look at our station because actually one of their people came from elburn and said you know what if you build a station and paddock you 'll actually go to town around and so possibly you might go to trouble I said our men do okay ready Steve memorial system and each other and 47 we 've also mentioned that we are an advantage of not report to the tenth part but I do believe we make it or not having a localized food supplies so councils made some great steps towards that process to get people rolling through enthusiasm spaces in vivo what is asking jenny was that because we 've got one has that disconnect it actually means that we consciously have to go out and do something whereas those communities where you are surrounded by food it actually becomes part of the background noise and you know there 's a huge interest in food and I think it 's partly because we actually realize we 've actually lost something that we once had and so bringing that back is actually going to energize a lot more people than perhaps if it was just there in case all the time so this is what I still referring to let 's turn these sort of inherent contradictions there 's apparent witnesses when I have and see how we can turn them into an opportunity so we actually could demonstrate a lot more about growing your own local food ads in a place where it 's just seen as a day to day activity we actually I think can energize people I must make a comment about yours the stuff that you got recent stat from America the average household in America has 57 tons of stuff delivered low that food that 's that 's what we 've done I watched my grandfather passed away a year to die and then we get the house of ending the Middies and the stop wannabe stuff over time look what I 've what Chris to do with that we stop and change we don 't need to change the sake of God you know just stuff it 's dead just wondering if that they know we have some pretty strong media networks with money to grab some new ones around certain species like growing your own vegetables or whatever it is and kind of getting that encouragement at that happen sharing you know sharing new things and sharing how things work and kind of Billy those networks I think coming I know that really do exist but think you really that 's it I just so I just want to mention the Stephanie Alexander projects in a couple of our foreign schools and there we go we 're we 're kids in primary school or learning not only how foods grown but that food is grown this is the new concept some children that Apple 's actually grow on trees the milk comes from a cow not a car so it 's it 's those sort of projects that I 'd love to see the council assist with some of those things about educating children around food that then start including sustainability environmental issues the kids are the ones who in 20 years are going to be making the decision whether our forests become urban areas in 30 years Jermaine looks like we need to get cases he 's now and it 's projects like that that are going to make those differences so they 're already there our communities already being taught those who want to learn can go and learn how to compost they can go and learn how to set up a garden they can go and get involved in in the old church on the hill garden that meets every second week on a Saturday afternoon these things already happening in the community Jean I know that you 've been putting together a compilation of all these different projects around town so that we can present that to the community so everyone can get involved who wants to there 's no hospitals as far as we are we now have a connection with the kids in spelling and the administrators particles here hey Jimmy have alluded to acknowledge the need for education suggest what do you see particularly interested in Catherine Evans view as the things what do you see the role of counsel as in the space of Education well I guess to revive experience we cleaned up not so much for school so starting to move into being a bit more involved in that sort of stuff but no we 've got a veggie patch in a lots of stuff where the kids are really excited to pull out the veggies but i think that this i think that is more that we can do and i think that you know they 've got this concept of push kinder kind of stuff but there 's this block behind us that 's awaiting one day potentially something to be built there that counts if you 're not quite sure about yet and we 're starting to talk about well revegetated that but I can also see attention whether this year 's eve in the garden sort of sites or nothing then the council could help with those sorts of things identifying areas of land that you know all the stuff that we 're all using together and sharing together and I think there 's a foo these free positive stuff that 's going on you know someone 's gotta live a tree and it 's got a million lemons on it well they should be bringing that to a place where everyone 's not buying 11 from this to safeway that they 're buying it they 're taking it from wherever he said it 's being left and we 're all sharing that I don 't grow up in a tree I grow a man directory and I don 't know a big with is that sense of community understand space so I 'm we 've been tryna do that or is wherever aware of it why was it anything for wearables to part where I easily on the ice planet developed yet to this day we still trying to get a concept plan now bill the other end of it from adventure place place place place people here who are involved with the original design from a community hub can be garden guy and yet we different levels of counsel and counselors that have come and gone and an evidence with soil conditions at the old site which was you know the most part you know I wasn 't he wants one responsibility in here but yet it being this huge community initiative to try and get that volunteerism to try you know attend meetings and progressively and yet i 'm personally exhausted trying to get get it off the ground and and finally this year actually i just have to see something happen there with a small and my budget play space design still want to go so I look at something like this and all these other new initiatives at like I just document they 're going to be another 10 years away are they going to be 15 away and here i thought this was a really good place that we could actually if we if we have this hardly built by now almost four years ago I mean like it when worn with first are they reaching run with rich in close to 10 now look they 'll be 20 years ago in the in the bigger bed so I just you know sometimes having black blue notes over my head and I bet it it really does frustrate people out there who are wanting to progress these things in yet you know a level of energy can start whining over a period of time how do we know to come that he 'll be appreciative you Trevor is gone with it happen even to your lobster then jumping wall of ice I just do it you know there 's some computer work with within counselor because I stimulus them together but you know at times we have how about regarding so um you know but I think there 's also some bite-sized things you can do what the various sub areas that they because of testing has to be done for the gas and all that sort of thing but there are areas around that presume that there was no tea and I think they need to be identified very quickly and make sure they are and do something on those on that on those particular areas so as things are be this is that you can hit up the council but one thing you know the slowness government is just so dry that was a whole plan was a boy approached anyway yeah I share a story by someone in a council in Melbourne decided that they wanted to get to car parks closed so they could actually create a space where people could sit and enjoy screen so they went through the normal processes and up for three months so I told I 've never allowed to do it so then I found out that none of you wanted to put a skip in the street because you were demolishing a building you could get a permit for twenty dollars and you could get it in 48 hours so a bus permit for a skip put it in the car parking space and converted to skip in the seats I did start with storage took 15 years to get street lights changed over so i did forget to mention that these turn ecological cards are skating around that will promote so if you wanted to use one of these patience I would disagree that if we can Saigon politicians and let them off if you look at what 's happened in Victoria since we 've been together and we came here we had vegetation regulations that meant you could actually and council would actually work with things like pays people like same line of people and save trees don 't really have that now because politicians of dismantle those knowing regulations there are some things sara is still true in the core of counseling and I was just wondering the other day with open space regulations of new developments such as we propose around station goes what is our land on an open space and is that something can counsel from their date I just want to tell story short with our finger tech boy he 's quite as I know a couple of years ago on to hiding in partially built a statement what product supports matter i told him he had debated developer but i still look beautiful jovi his side dog leash swamp and you put a board he said that 's because the council here and I wondered is this more than possible it is possible but there is a mango a requirement five percent of the land area or what needs to be equipped with in cash or what that isn 't that money cool but you might you know look around some of the nura states around vinegar some of these developers are actually providing direct I mean might know the percentage that the imagined estate at strat bill say it must be close to twenty five percent you know the leadership changed serve with progressive and programs are around the 20 or nearly twenty percent of the month and that 's in bathroom locks on a plane still will be coming true in there spiders it is after the development they say that was something i have eaten I think that idea is working that way we are just in the process of starting a public open space strategy I was going to but that would be one of the issues we have to address sorry yeah be right there you 're too yeah just a couple of things and the comment 're doing become whatever dealing with foods and actually working you know in the school or through industry and through work experience so this is quite a bit of a gap or we 're not watching privacy Oh couple other things administrative in terms of the panel each of you in terms of what you would see is your ideal because I suppose we 'll all that you come here tonight probably got a bit of an idea or what our what we said what would be one of the things would really like to see happen so interested he admits and power what you would see why in relation to the strategy so the second thing is in terms of obviously councils commitment and given the Peters here and other councillors just in regards to the commitment the council will make clogs when we go through this sort of process and I suppose picking up on Adrienne 's sort of exhaustion and cynicism around things that community gets relatively involved but to what extent then does the community have confidence that councils going to commit to it and obviously some commitment in terms of probably things that are like little pilots for example the council going to put some money and commitment behind to then get the community to respond so it 's kind of like council needs to do a bit of behavior change as well as the community to respond and see it as an example of that sore all modern war I minister to hear probably the paramedic there or council wants to learn some comic because I suppose you know we can have lots of objectives that 's what strategy that they wanted objectives that 's being implemented in on the ground to send things really change clothes one thing that prevents at the beginning said about you organic food collection it 's kind of like it 's I wanna come in one sense and we 're sending a truck round to get it collected white people having a conference been you know in their backyard so you get rid of having a tow truck to do that or I suppose my little everyone is why don 't we recycle every site collection one what two trucks running your group possibly so these things like that but anyway have a go first two things if we design a city so that works but eight year old 80 year olds the rest of all be right and the second thing is that if every child mendigo feels comfortable putting their hand into three young kids and I guess really appreciating the program that we have and and the way that might bring kids into engaging me eicher and i really like to see the council support some of those sorts of being somewhat more as well as i know the council does so for some parts of it but there 's a lot you know unfortunate my kids going into that has access to push kingdom but and spring over but not everyone does and so it must be parcels of land area one of the things i thought the future event going and is concerned me is that we know you threw bottles and that at some point we will run out fossil fuels and our food supply system is underpinned by fossil fuel you don 't have access to really available fossil fuels we don 't have food so i 'd like to see some some future thinking on how to address those issues when the land that we do have in our city that super would grow food has now got estates all over i used to grow tomatoes now they grow and I guess that 's my my sure that 's coming from both as a food retailer and community garden looking at capacity building around justifying your own 30 minutes 50 years ago every backyard and vinegar and loop road now half thousand bit ago have some of us assassin it because they 've all been subdivided we 've lost that capacity to prepare oh that 's that 's a big concern for xdd that 's growing 100,000 plus I 'm really I suppose thinking about our change and the reduction in water but we have to use and almost of urban emerald so you know I think we need to be thinking about sand water management and what we can do as part of this strategy and pains think and about it as a starter but for example kind of subdivisions on kind of lifestyle blocks not just in the city grow going to go go all through the corridor right right develop why don 't you want to subdivide these box real ones down so it really the smartest way to use that water why don 't think so impacts will have waterways and excellent a lot of things and reliable or so and you 're going too far less water spill up in NZ get smarter about how we how we think about that not just about now about what 's going to happen in 30 50 years talk and what release day attempted and I your brains far less I 'm like it and pulling else will so I just feel like we just need to be will be smarter if we can deal with those issues a particular without planning and we may be others produced might as well my one comment about what 's been said six years ago I went to a restaurant in Portland Oregon and either restaurant we eighty percent how everything world we just need to think how we have run not only out of time but over time so I apologize to those of you didn 't get your opportunity to avoid short

high calibre events and initiatives to you to enhance the success of the local business community and please contact the team at the City of Greater Bendigo to discuss all available options a local small business on five four three four six thousand now I 'd like to introduce your presenter Paul henschel who 's the CEO for the australasian region for action coach international with over 20 years experience I 'm sure he 's got some great information to share so now it 's over you thanks Paul thanks Peter very much for that and welcome aboard everybody for our ninth webinar in the in the series of growth of a small business growth accelerator series and of course this particular webinar is is called the right person in the right job and it 's all about doing exactly that you might have noticed that our our visual for that is is is in fact round pegs round holes square pegs square holes etc so I guess the the real theme of this obviously and that and the thrust of this is is that getting the right person in the right job and that means it 's all about getting the right pig in the right not necessarily what what and what everybody tends to do when they 're recruiting and even in terms of restructuring it 's also appropriate for restructuring people within the existing organisation existing people within the existing organization to to make sure again that you know the right jobs are being assigned to the right people and that will be part of what we talked about today but the main the main part will be working through what I have found to be a very effective recruiting system a very efficient one a very effective one and one that that and I say primarily gets the right people in the right hole because I think it 's dangerous to say that something 's failsafe but it 's certainly over my dozen or so years of coaching and utilizing this system with vote from both myself and clients then the hit rate has been extremely high so let 's let 's have a look and see what that what that system is so the right pig in the right hole has to start with that has to start with the right hole is appreciate what is the role what is the good job that we 're looking that we 're looking to film so we start not with the person but with in fact the job again does that seem obvious I probably now that I say it but it gives us it gives a real solid starting point so let 's talk about what that that means one of the first thing to appreciate about the job is not what it 's called runs title or anything else but what are the honest a four to six it 's a guide I think that if you start to talk about more than that you 're probably talking about duties and responsibilities rather than objectives so what are the what are the four to six and again might not eat na p3 but the smaller number of key objectives of the position so if the positions all about sales then it will be the key objective is to generate generate connections that that generate so many sort of connections in sales that might be fundamentally to convert or to sell X amount what 's the outcomes of the position not what are the inputs but one of the outcomes what are you what is the job there to produce and if we can catch that in only a few key objectives then it 's very clear what role that the the position plays within the company and how it 's how it will contribute to the success of the business the second part about that I alluded to some numbers in that key objective for instance how many X amount of sales let 's say if we 're in the car industry and it would be to at the end of the day it would be to to to sell 15 cars a month so that sounds easy in car sales but in your position your in business and around your objectives what we need to do next is actually look at each of those clear objectives and understand how they will be measured not what the number is just yet but how will those key objectives be measured because now we 're starting to put some accountability on the role right and and eventually undertake this role and you know a year later or six months later or even three months later that they 'll appreciate whether they 're actually achieving their objectives or not so it won 't be a case of how do you think I 'm doing it will be very clear to them good upon me and to yourself how well they 're actually doing so understand how well if how it will be measured so then we 're talking about the tasks required what are the tasks the key tasks that were being required to achieve each objective so take each objective at a time where there 's three or four or five and understand so fundamentally what are the key tasks that will need to be performed in your opinion to achieve each of those objectives and and will lay well you know I 'm assuming that you understand the role that you 're putting somebody into well enough to be able to actually do those things and create this list so what are the tasks how are they performed now the now we 're so now we 're talking about how to fulfill those tasks so the tasks are related to the objectives and now we 're actually saying okay this is how you do each of these tasks so this is that the how-to manual appreciating that what you 're forming here is in fact this how-to manual that you will train the end comment or the incoming put a person in this role this is how they will actually be trained this is how they will learn the job that will be learned because it 'll be it 'll be it 'll be already documented on how to do what what comes up what are the tasks that need to be undertaken around those objectives and how are each of those tasks performed now if that sounds a labor intensive task well you 're probably right but if you want success in this role then these are the requirements you might find that there are actually a lot of simpler than you think that or it might seem straight away so and then finally how long do they take so how long an indicator of how long of how much time you need to employ somebody for you know you don 't always need to employ people full-time and if it 's part time you want to know how many hours now it 's not it 's pointless employing somebody for insufficient number of hours to do a job and also it 's pointless to employ somebody for more hours than what actually need to be done they 'll just get bored or they will in fact follow Parkinson 's wall which says that they 'll expand the job to fill that time so you 've got a pretty much have a pretty good idea how long the tasks actually how long this job takes to perform and you 've also then got the ability to give that to the person coming in as a guideline so that they actually know how long the job is supposed to take otherwise you know what is the indicator so hopefully that makes sense the key objectives how they measured what the tasks are that lead to those objectives how those tasks to perform and 've got a really really great profile now of what the job actually actually is and so therefore now you can write that you can now write a job description you 'll say you 'll include the objective you 'll include a summary of the business what it 's what it does what its objectives are what the key objectives of this positioner what the key tasks are you won 't include how they 're performed in the job description that 's that that comes in a you know in a manual once the persons in point but now you 've got and of course you 've got also how long it takes so now you 've got a a really solid job description to start this start this off so now now we look for now that we 've appreciated what they what the hole looks like or the role looks like we can now start to identify much more clearly what sort of person we 're looking for for the job so here we go in terms of appreciate or how we identify the pig or the person we 're doing is appreciating and identifying their values because the the real issue is most of the challenges come down the track when the values are not shared in that means yours and therefore the businesses and there 's so what do I mean by that well we 'll talk about values as we go along but understand that the values of the first thing so i 'm looking about with people who who who have got if it 's to do with you know if you like if customer service and and learning and commitment are your values then that 's what we 're starting to look for the second thing they 're looking for is a match in terms of behavioral profile so what 's the behavior behavioral profile of the job and therefore what 's the put in it and we 're looking for a match with with a with a prospector prospects behaviors the thing we 're looking for is attitude what attitude is appropriate now you can generalize and sort of say a good one but that 's unfortunately too general so what is your business and then finally of course what 's the skill set so if you can if you can look at that list and see the order and appreciate that skills are at the bottom of the list too often I see people in point on skills but of course they generally don 't fire on skills they hire a higher on skills and they fire on the other three on one two or all three of the other other things so what we really need to do is start with those other things because I mean let 's face it if if you 're if you connect with someone with the matching values with the right behaviors and the right attitude then the skills can be can be learned or taught it 's more important to get the first three right than it is to get the fourth one right and ignore the first three so let 's talk about each of those those areas of values so so here I 've put up an example of what what is what our values how well do the candidates values well we 've got to know what your values are first so your values if you 're the business owner are in fact the values of the business so generally it 's not very hard to sort of ask the question or what are their values of my business and you need to ask the question what do you value as the business owner what are your top dozen or so at the most values because and and if you want values are your guide your guiding light your overall rules if you like it 's important really important to actually sit down and list what your top dozen or so values actually are and they become your your overarching guide for the for the behaviors that will be accepted encouraged and those that obviously want so the first thing you 've got to do is is determine what your values are then you can start to where you can use those in you if you are can you if you like in your recruitment whatever you know methodology that looks like in terms of advertising or whatever you can place I 've always found that you know giving people access to the values of the organization tends to be an attraction when they look at the values of the organization and they say that sounds very much like me well now you 're on the right on the right path that you 've got to set yours and then look to establish what there 's are and how do you do that we 'll talk about the interview a little bit further but you know getting people or finding out how well they matches is is simply a part of the process so there 's the values part most been a bit of time on on behaviour how we identify behaviors in this case and one thing that I have used for a long time and a lot of people have used years now in recruiting is is profiling if you 're not using any sort of profiling then you really hit miss you 're really not not doing much of a job in terms of recruitment how do you us because the this is one of that this to getting the right person you see what what we 've found is that certain behaviors that are that are inherent in a person ingrained in a person contribute very much to how well they do certain jobs and a tour or or you know how poorly they might do certain jobs will go through this and I 'll explain it as I go I use behavioral profile called disk di SC and will explain what that stands for but the rationale for this is it 's quite a simple behavioral profile but it 's extremely powerful and quite easy to understand and I 'll take you through that for those people who they were familiar with disk this will be a reminder for those that are it 'll be something quite new education so so we have four fundamental stars now each person in the world is a combination of all of all four so there if you like their thumbprint is the comp is how the combination of how much D how much I how much s and how much see and you know it 's no rights with certain types of jobs that almost are prerequisites almost all leaders to the successes and certain job so let 's put these four letters up di s and C and they stand for a dominant influencer stable and compliant now these are the primary behavioral style and to be able to define them fairly simply we find that the top two DS and eyes dominant influences are outgoing people whereas compliant and stable are more reserved type people so you can so to say to yourself right now are you a new an outgoing person or are you a reserved person you 've automatically have the possibilities you 're either do or i or c and s now on this left-hand side you 'll see DD and see their task focused people on the right hand side of the screen we 're looking at eyes and s 's there people are into so if you 're an outgoing people are people oriented person your primary profile or primary characteristic will be I if you 're an outgoing task oriented person your primary characteristic will be D a reserved a an S and a task focused person is reserved will be a see so let 's look at each of those as we go independently so the D the D stands for dominant now I 've I 've made these into so that you can remember them and so that it 's a little bit more I suppose easy to to explain I 've turned them all into if they were birds the deal would be an eagle okay so what 's the characteristics of a d well the d stands for dominant they love problems to solve problems to dominate their characterized by being quite fast paced clearly their decision makers and they love to lead so you 'll find a lot of heidi 's let 's say in positions of the ownership and positions of management because they like to call the shots if you like now if you 're looking for a position that is that requires those characteristics then you 're looking for somebody who is primarily a d they 're competitive and directing they focus on what needs to be done and how quickly so very structured around outcomes and goals and results so you might think well that 's a great profile for any for everybody every job that I 've got in my business but not really think about it is it really is it really ideal to have a business full of chiefs and no Indians if you 're looking for an Indian then you 're not looking for a D and in fact if you put addy in that position of course what they 'll start to do is create a bit of chaos by fundamentally taking could troll and you know what wanting to I suppose do more in decision making them perhaps what you 're looking for so that 's that that 's a that 's a d-type characteristic now I 'm talking about each of these characteristics in isolation remembering that everybody 's a combination of all four of these but I 'm looking at each of these ones in it 's sort of its fullest sense to give you an idea about what a day actually looks like so again so I if the position requires those a lot of d is what you 're looking for let 's look at the I remember this is outgoing people oriented so what are they bird peacock they like to be noticed you know they like attention it 's very much a case of look at me hence the peacock now what the greater their greater influencing people they can get people to do things so the good leaders they 're characterized they 're quite talkative they love interaction and they love me and I love social so where 's the application for this will imagine sales for instance without those characteristics you know building rapport establishing connection with people high levels of communication all of those nurturing nurturing characteristics in sales perfect so you know the high i love is those sorts of situations and those situations situations love those people so they 're talkative and interacting they focus on who because they 're big the big deal is that these people and other people so you know where you 're looking for with a role that 's got a lot of interaction requires a lot of monitoring of issue say influencing rather than dominating and directing then this is the type of a behavioral profile that you 're looking for so their challenges they 're always looking necessarily for approval themselves so of course they need to be acknowledged if the one that went highs work for you you have you have to make sure that you know they 're getting lots of recognition and acknowledgement for what they 're actually doing okay so that 's the high ideal what 's the S this is stable yes the S loves sameness yes the bird is the Dove you know who doesn 't love doves right it 's like there 's heaps of them in the world they don 't usually upset anybody there all of those sorts of things they 're quieter unassuming they go about their business that 's the S so very stable I like to work at a steady pace they stay around for a long time because what why because they don 't like change and therefore they 're loyal now oil because they don 't like to change and so they stick if they 've got a negative is that they have a grudges you know you never want to do the wrong thing bonus they may not get you quickly but they will get you somewhere down the track so but but that aside you can appreciate that if the job is one that requires relative sameness you know just work along nothing much changes come in do the job go again tomorrow 's pretty much the same it can mean because the people interaction is perfectly fine because they like to interact with people they just don 't like to be the highlight of those people 's life if you 've got a job if this job is one that that is relatively that is quite consistent that is quite repetitive then you 're looking for a nest in those in those positions they accept and they 're accepting and doing they focus on how things will be done so remember the deal was about what needs to be done the I was very much around who the S is very much about how how things are done so if they don 't want to rock the boat and stability again so you 'll say well that 's a great characteristic that 's what I 'm looking for in this in this role terrific that 's why you use a profile to find out whether they 're that 's their key their primary trait and certainly in Australia you 'll generally find that around fifty percent of the population are in fact esas so you 're pretty fair shot at actually attracting a few of those and isn 't this quite a quite a lot around okay so that just leaves the sea so what 's the season see is compliant what would the bird be there factual their statistical the bird is of course the owl so best characterized otherwise I 'll now and here 's the characteristics of the sea they love procedures they love detail they finish jobs they like rules to find the the term compliant doesn 't come from nowhere they are they are rule followers so you know if you 've got systems and procedures and a lot of and workflows and it has profile for that sort of work if it 's factual or so if it 's figures based if you if you if you look at what sort of jobs do compliant people fall into well they fall into engineering bookkeeping accounting mechanics surgeons even the people that were routine or if you like process rules the rules the roost so family enough with birds there I guess if you 're going to fly on a plane you 'll certainly want it to be the confidence would be that has been built by a high C every night in every bolt every tick everything 's been analyzed and everything 's been qualified great in those jobs and of course I put put that in the wrong job and that can be that can that mean it could slow down it could be you know over analysed and all of those sorts of things so of course the cities there they assess and they 're thinking Thai people they really focus on the why they ask lots of why questions because they love the detail of every of every job quality and does your job require you can say what it requires all of these things okay well then that would be the mix but what is that what is the right mix for this job for the job that you 're that you 've outlined in your job description so go by being able to analyze the job we can actually start to connect the right people with the right job and it 's it 's just more of the right peg in the right in the right hole so if we think about the the DI yes and see we 're talking about the DS primarily going to be in more management leadership and decision-making type roles the I is going to be lend itself more to people and the interaction with people the S is looking for a job that 's actually quite unchanging and long-term and repetitive and the sea is looking for a lot lots of process-oriented sightings quality qualitative analysis numbers that 's that sort of thing okay so just as a profile summary you 'll see here that the D they like the problems they love control the influencer is a lot of people influence in order to avoid loss of affinity which is you know people loving them as it were a stable pace pace steady pace they have security in that steadiness in that safety I said they 're not big they 're not high risk takers and the compliance love procedures to comply to in order to avoid the loss of quality so they 're all there about quality control so I hope that gives you a pretty good understanding very quickly if this guy can do this disc days days I could do it I could do disc for a week but that 's just very much an overview and that 's the reason why I always loved using disk because it 's relatively easy to understand it 's it 's it 's definitely a lot takes quite a while to master but it doesn 't take very long to understand and to connect and just sort of get it if that makes sense so now how do you know what a person is or you can you can tell from get them to do a profiler within an interview and you know for sure what the actual mix is I talked before about understanding the role now there is such a thing as a reverse disc assessment which means that once you 've established what that role is which we did earlier in the in a webinar we can we can do a reverse disc on it which means that we can disk we can do a behavioral profile on the roll itself not on the person but on the role so we appreciate so we build a DI SC profile how much do you how much I hammer tests and how much c is ideal for the role based on the roll itself hope that makes it so reverse engineering we 're disk profiling the job and then we 're dis profiling the people that apply for it and look to see how well that matches so that 's called a reverse disc assessment you know that that those are available you can do that they 're available online they 're available manually I have the tool to do 's determined by the person personal people who know that role best okay so based on what we now know around the job the values that we 're looking for the behavior that we 're looking for the skill set obviously that you 're also looking for you can now start to design an ad yeah you know whether it be online or newspaper or where or tie the lampposts whatever it might be however you go going to promote or put this out linkedin for instance is a really good social media platform now for recruitment we built with now building a profile of the job and so we 're starting to put together what does the person who best fits this job going to look like what are their values what 's their disc profile now we don 't put in an ad we were looking for a person with eight seventy five percent D sixty percent I but what what I 've what we 're able to do is from the reverse disc profile the reverse proof this profile also tends to will also allow us a and we use those words in the recruitment advert or process so that so that the attraction is to people of that disc type they don 't know it but you 've used the right combination of words that that disc profile wants to see you 've used values that fit their values and of course you have you have made it clear what is what are some of the fundamental skills that that the person would have and qualifications of course so there 's your brief in terms of your advert start with the values the words that actually connect with that disc style the skills that you 're looking for and if there are qualifications the qualifications they 're looking for so now you 've got a really solid recruitment profile and you 've put it out there I said if you like okay so what happens after this okay what we what we want next is now we 're going to talk about the recruitment process and this is a process of deselection not selections it 's not about you having 50 candidates you know in front this is and having to pick you know the right ones this is very much from here on in it 's it 's it 's what I call a process of deselection the hbu you provide enough you provide the right barriers and and in this case you 'll see the hoops and the candidates need to be able to jump through a tube they need to continue on the process they deselect themselves the best example of this and I know it 's an extreme one but whether you 've ever read much about the the process of qualification for the SAS I remember reading somebody 's profile it was in the SAS and they and they explain what the process was to get in and the process to get in is not selection it 's deselection there is there are so they just keep putting a series of tests and tasks in front of everybody and the people who don 't pass deselect themselves so they literally drop out they they come up to the instructors and say you know I 'm out basically and so those people don 't do select themselves are still in your process needs to be something like that you 're not probably going to make everybody go through mud and ice water and barbed wire but something akin to those things that that are in your that the connect in terms of your business is it 's the same sort of thing so just understand that now we 're actually putting up a purposely putting up a series of hurdles that people need to jump through and the first one is their initial response so what do they do first up what 's the very first thing that they actually need to do and this is important so once you put your ad out there it 's about what they do next in the ad we need to put instructions on what to do and if that means call this number at a certain time personally I always make those things at a certain time I make them very clear I 'll make them you know call on tuesday or wednesday between twelve o 'clock and two o 'clock and ask for want to fire some instructions that you 've already built then this is the first test on whether they can follow instructions if they email you then they haven 't read the notice if they 've failed that bit then they 're gonna fail at following any other instructions that you have in your business so these are part of the advertisement is tell them what to do to respond in the first instance find this number and and be prepared to tell us etc ok so somebody turns up in person with their resume clearly they haven 't followed the instruction ok shall we tell them what to do when to do it how to do it ok so it 'll be calling this number at this time and tell us at ABC it might be you put your it could be put your resume together deliver it in but in person by next when you know on between nine o 'clock and twelve o 'clock on Monday Tuesday or Wednesday it 's whatever you want to make it and put it make it something that works for you in the paper and then spend the rest of their week being interrupted by random phone calls don 't you know set some parameters right from the start about what you what your expectations are about how people will apply and ask three questions so so I 'll give you an example of my methodology would be in the first instance respond by ringing this button this number at certain times and be prepared to answer three key questions okay so what are the three questions well I asked you know what is it what was the biggest why did you respond what was the what was the one thing that that attracted you to this position how do you think you can add value to our business and you know what is your front what is your 1 major objective right now in your personal life for instance so the three questions themselves are they aren 't important what 's important is that people actually communicate that you get a feel for number one how what is there what is their thinking like what is their expression like what context is more important than the content so um do i do that on the personally not usually I would do it the number that i will get people to call would have that honor on a unlimited answering machine as in no time limit so it doesn 't cut off in 30 seconds for instance so you know if they if they spend 5 minutes telling you the answer to those three questions then that 's that 's perfectly fine then you can in your time review those responses and just see well how well did they respond did they respond in the right time did they restore on the right method and what was the what how well did they answer those questions so straightaway you haven 't had to do really anything but you start you 've got you 've got a certain amount of data on those people right from the start so there 's the very initial response now did they pass you know in reviewing that did they find the instructions what was what is my opinion of their responses how well do they a job description out to them so what i would do is i would i would email them all would call and say look thanks for your application thanks for your thanks for your response to our advertising i 'm going to send you a job description with some instructions on what to do next and i would simply send that out now what I would ask next is if this job this job looks appealing to you if you 'd still like to be considered for this job then you need to send me your CV you profile your bio whatever you want to call it by a certain date and in a certain format and in a certain form I then looked through those sea v so I 've never got a lot of information about that person already I would notify I would filter those based on what I 'm looking for and that would be more likely maybe skill set maybe experience maybe some of the things that they do outside of the business that gives me an indicator of what sort of person they 're notify them next to do the next step the next step would be I would invite them to a group interview so again give the details of the group interview that sort of says congratulations you know basically is still in the running for this job we 'd like to invite you to a group interview which will be held at four o 'clock on tuesday the such and such a thing please come dressed appropriately and bring whatever you want them to bring if there 's anything that might be just and bring your best attitude it could be simply that okay so many we were asking them to do something again what happens if they you know if they if they don 't respond they 're deselected make sense that 's the point they 're deselecting themselves you 're not having to do the work okay now we talked about the group interview well what 's here 's the first few things punctuality you can judge judge you know how did they present themselves when they turned up were they were they flustered were they were they late probably didn 't get in in the first place but that 's going to test their punctuality their appearance and their first your first impression were they appropriate as in you know did they dress appropriately did they present themselves well now it 's over to you you 're going to then lead this group interview and it 's it 's relatively short so again very efficient and you 're going to tell people about what your vision is for your company if this scares you and you don 't know what your vision is for your company do you think you might have some work to do before you actually start importing other people into your business if you don 't know what your company vision is don 't expect them to actually go down the right roads so you 're going to have to say okay here 's is this is my company here 's who we are here 's where we 're going why brightness of future we 're talking about people who want to get excited about where your company 's going and want to help to get on your bus and to get on your bus they have to know where your bus is going ok so you 're going to explain your company vision you going to explain your company values what matters in this company one of the what are the rules as it were what 's the overarching rules of the game these are the values of our company this is again this is also a cement and attract the right people you gotta actually just very quickly run through the position description again I know they received it but you 're going to give it some you 're going to verbalize that job description and by the way by the way from the more current employees you 've got at this process to better why you 've just reinvigorated there or reminded them about your company vision and your company values as well but you 're also going to use them to actually judge become judges also so it won 't be just your decision so you 're going to go through the job description position description then you 're going a 5-10 minute break if this doesn 't sound like that company that you 're that you 're you want to work for if this doesn 't sound like the job that you thought it was then then I would invite you at this point in time while we take the break to take that opportunity to discontinue I thank you for your time I thank you for coming and I wish you all the best now at that point in time some people may leave what you 'll say then is if you come back after the break I 'll assume that those that the vision the values and the job or match what you want to do and the company matches with where you want to go great so is that make sense so now I 've got so okay now I 'm going to take a quick break maybe a bit of a walk a bit of a walk around a bit you can have a cup of tea you available they can grab a quick drink or whatever and when they come back you know that qualified for the next part and the next part says okay I 'm going to get you to do a personal presentation just five minutes tell us me a little bit about yourself and selling me tell me why you should get this job tell me why you think you 're the right person that I 'm looking for if they can 't sell themselves particularly sniffing the sales role by the way then they 're never going to sell too much else and did how much do they need to prepare not much you can tell them before the break that this is what they 'll be on that they 'll need to do and so they can use the break to do it a little bit of a preparation the next thing I do is some form a skills assessment if your job the job that you 're walking your field has a particular set of skills and that might be well you know they fundamentally need to be good with numbers all I need to be good with the hands or they need to be you know quickly then come up with a test that will actually test that skill not to the nth degree you know if they pay for a job as a builder you hunted obviously to build a house but get think about what would be something that I could get them to do that would be skills assessment if it 's if it 's some particular software that lives you 've said in your original that they need that skip they need to have experience in think about how will I test that what will I get them to do that will actually test that and then finally I do a disc assessment obviously get them to fill out a disc assessment and and then you know I take that away and assessing later but and determine what their profile is and see how well that matches so hopefully that gives you a pretty good rundown of what the group interview starts to look like and appreciate how much information now I 've got about these people and in the end to be honest how little work I 've had to do to stay in the process you can appreciate that the inappropriate people are dropping out along the way and only the only the right people are actually sticking with this with this process the next thing I would do the next thing I will do is check references I don 't check references at the end of this process the next the next stage is to check references so they 've given you a CV they 've brought it with them or this remember they send it back in so you 've now got the opportunity to use reference checking as a filter not as a final selection tool you know too many people that come down to the last person and then they do the reference checks what you 're going to do here now is based on what you 've already heard I 'll go back to here based on the presentation the skills assessment and the disc assessment you 'll probably knocked a few people out with olive obviously knock themselves out the ones that are left will now do a reference check that will probably eliminate now we re-interview them one on one now we talk about final selection based on that interview it 's just my openly this make sense is that the precursor to what most people would see as their one and only process shortlist from a CV interview make a selection not enough information in that process clearly no D selections make-or-break fundamentally by how well they present in a 20-minute interview so it 's not comprehensive enough that methodology this is much more comprehensive so re-interview now where I 'm going to re-interview is I 'm going really refined I 'm going to talk more about some of the things that came up at the group interview you 're going to explore a few more avenues in terms of that I 'm going to take some notice about how they present and what they presented and it 's clearly going to going to trigger some questions that I will be raised of me and they will of course have some more defined questions as well that they will that the this interview this personal interview will enable them to to ask made a final selection before you sign any agreements that you undertake some sort of paid a trial that you might employ them for two days employ them for a day important for a week pay them and and and well how appropriate will they be to the actual job well not really but how well do they apply themselves can they follow instructions simple things to do you know if you really want to know somebody well they say you employ them will go on holidays with them one of the two but how well do you get to know your friends differently when you go on holidays with them than just you know the interactions that you that you might have you 've got to have some way to actually go the next step and find out a little bit more about their their nuances if you like and see whether they work for you or not then what do we do next now we 're talking about an employment agreement you should everybody should have an employment agreement that the details all of the details if you can go to the government website and download an employment agreement that is current for your steak very simple cost you nothing modifier don 't modify the fundamental legal requirements of it but certainly you can you can add some detail to it around the specific job or you attach the job description to the employment we should have a training program an induction an initial training program an ongoing training program so think about what how what you will train them in what will be their first day what will be their first week what is the training program over the first three months or six months what will I do I need them to learn how will I how will that be taught okay and then we 're talking about reviews so here 's my suggestion in terms of timeliness or frequency of those reviews the first thing you should review is after one day so after their first day at the end of that so tell me you know what are your thoughts of the first day what are your observations here are mine of you what you 're fit I appreciate you don 't you know you 're probably it 's a little bit 's pretty confusing at the moment but you know how well you did fit with what we what with what we said in the first place so after the end of the first day after the end of the first week after the end of the first month and then after the end of it after the end of the first quarter after that my suggestion is six monthly they 're not a review is not a pee review a review as a performance review it 's a it 's a it 's so how well does this how well you know where you where you fight where you 're finding difficulty what areas are you enjoying what areas aren 't you enjoying what sort of things do we might we need to do to help you along what support do you need those sorts of questions hi reviews too many people put it all the emphasis are we have to review somebody because of because of their pain no you have and and what do i need to to help them become better not well how much we just have to have a review so as I know whether I 'll give you CPR CPI or or or a bit more there it 's a completely separate process okay so oh okay so hopefully that 's giving you a whole different dimension to recruitment and you can appreciate I believe that getting the right people in our business is the single most important activity in the growth of any business if you get the right people your business will succeed if you don 't get the right people it will be stuck or in fact go backwards you 'll be going back and forwards or backwards forever they 're more important than further than than customers we spend you know time reviewing targeting appreciating profiling our best our best customers and then just employ people who walk in the door so you know this is is it a major exercise absolutely it is but how important is it to get the right people if you 're not getting the right people the right things to get those people you know you get the people you deserve if you don 't put the effort into getting the right people then you will get the people that is appropriate to the process that you 're applying you know if your entire process is well if they walk in the door and they hand over a resume all I employ them then don 't complain if at the end of it you 're seeing lots of wrong people in your in your in your business and you know so often it 's it 's it 's the owner that sort of says are you know the problem is my people well at the end of the day you employed them and and and they 're your responsibility so don 't hand that back to them take responsibility make sure you put the right people and in the first place and make sure that then once you put them in that you do the right things to ensure that they continue to help your business grow I hope you 've gotten a lot of out available of course as is always our webinars are available in a website within a few days I want to just as we finish up making aware of a few more opportunities that exist the first one of course is I talked about discrete disc profiles the disc report that I 've got that I utilizes an online disc program it 's a 44-page disc report so you can you can undertake a 44-page disc report for you yourself for your team and for your team members and you know you could you are also able to use these for obviously for your recruitment process so individually they 're 44 you can buy a group of five or set of 5 4 198 dollars you know my email address potential at actioncoach com just shoot me an email and say you 'd like to undertake or undergo or grab that opportunity the next webinar we have is called if only everyone on the team did it like me it 's about consistency and it 's about if you aren 't reproducing yourself within the business so that so that everybody they 're actually performing the tasks and procedures and processes the way that you want them done ok so that 's our next webinar it 's number 10 in the series it 's on the tenth of November a Tuesday attentive November from eight o 'clock till nine o 'clock and the other opportunity and

've enjoyed this hope you got a lot of learning out of it hope you apply the process and just appreciate how comprehensive and how well this process works and in fact probably in the end takes you less time then potentially the process that you using at the moment wish you all the best with your business and hope you and bye for now _"

    "text": "I hello and welcome to the Visitor Information Center on pell mell in central Bendigo the center is hosting a beautiful exhibition Flamingo Park and beyond which celebrates the iconic fashion of Jenny key and Linda Jackson and today I have the great pleasure of joining both the artists here ladies how do you feel to see your work displayed like this and to stand together and appreciate it well it looks just amazing i mean it 's it 's a it 's little bits and pieces from the beginning going right through to now and it just shows our range of work in this beautiful space and it 's it 's very alive and energetic i really love this show it 's very special so colorful but it 's it 's it 's the general feel of a starting out in 1973 to 2016 and it looks beautiful in this space and it just works really well with people coming in and getting enveloped in the color hmm it 's just such a beautiful journey as you say of your time together what 's it like when Jenny and happens magic happened back in 1973 we just were able to you know share you know like 43 years of being together and you know going on different paths but really actually I 'm paralleling yes that 's what 's amazing about Linda and I is that we 've we 've we 've had this extraordinary design career but somehow well I guess it 's because our inspiration comes from Australia we love we 're passionate about nature and that is reflected in all our work constantly and that doesn 't go away you know that connection and that end the friendship but it 's the nature and you know I mean I 'm just looking around at the work i mean you know linda and i can consistently inspired by you know look at Waratahs you know there 's so many different versions of a sort of Waratahs my knees were my sort of Waratahs and then we vendors opals Jenny 's over but then I 'm looking at the desert and I 'm looking at one of Linda 's appliqués and then I 'm looking at my scarf that 's got some uh larue right through it you know all these parallel inspirations that just come out in this most divine creative way I mean it 's it 's you know I 'm I heard you all to come down if you haven 't already I mean there 's another beautiful version of waratahs and then you know in my black and white there 's all these peace signs and and symbols of unity it 's it 's an earth first written on jumpers you know it 's it 's it 's such a testament to our love of them environment yes and as a small space how it fits into the space and what it looks like is remarkable and really thrilling to see when it 's beautiful isn 't it is and it really works yeah sort of it envelops you in all in all your designs were you did you were you making statements on purpose about what you 're putting on your designs about treasuring error oh definitely sorts of things absolutely always all done and loving it and wanting to work out ways or knitting hand knitting all of it really trying to emulate the country inspire us and other people about how beautiful it is and to treasure enter treasure it exactly but using it in in completely beautiful ways like like the sewing of a garment like the knitting of the garment everything was made incredibly beautifully and you know when I think about what 's happening now there 's a beautiful exhibition of Viktor and Rolf and then they call themselves fashion artists but in fact when Linda and I started we were we were artists in fashion but it the garment always had to be wearable and and that you know that 's personified in something as simple as that knitted outfit I mean it 's it 's completely wearable you know we put it completely we immerse ourselves in every you know turbines and the lock but you can just take that scarf off it 's a piece of art but it 's yes you don 't have to every single piece of it all the time that you can collect the pieces and you treasure them all them on to other you know someone else in the family which is what lots of people tell us that all that dress now my niece has got it or she 's wearing it out and she loves it you know it 's all the treasures and and people should think more about clothes like that now it 's really important because I 'm I should invest in them like that shouldn 't they are not this fast fashion but making it Nova investment that you keep and share yes but they thing is that that 's what we did we always worked with limited editions and you know every piece is is special with us but that 's not so with commercial fashion so you can 't go out and just you know I don 't know get something from country road or you know young designers that are doing disposable type of fashion and think that you 're going to keep it forever but with Linda and I it was always art pieces to be worn so it 's great to to see your age group loving them twin souls how did your souls find each other how did you create flamingo path rocks along well I 'd come back from London and I knew that I had to when I decided to open shop I just knew that I had to do something that had never been sort of seen before because I 've been in the the hub of what was absolutely amazing in the 60s in London and so I decided to set up flamingo park with a painting the Flamingo Park painting that was done by my husband Michael ramsden that had to be the centerpiece of the shop I met Linda in June in 1973 I opened the shop in August as soon as I met Linda you know she had this lovely exhibition of clothes that she was selling in the manathil galleries in all the Queen Street galleries I think in Sydney and she just had all the things that I was influenced by in London they were they were her clothes that you know because I was madly into the 50s and he met we were madly in two fifties that i found in a shop in melbourne apart from jobs warehouse which everyone knows but finding those things and then finding a like-minded person because people when i took them up for this exhibition in sydney people said you 've got to meet Jenny key and we could have met in London because I was there but we weren 't destined to meet then and when we met it 's like now we just were like this just click just click like it 's like click that the glass of lies yeah it 'll happen yes the magic it just it just happened and then then this amazing symbiotic relationship developed creatively where we we just did the most extraordinary fashion shows and how do people respond to your designs when they saw your store what was it like and to see famous people then go on to wear them like princess died wearing your koala jumper and that sort of thing well there were lots of really famous people and lots of not famous people at all and all of that was all a treasure as well to get something beautiful to wear as well as somebody of course really famous is amazing as well but I loved it when David Bowie came in and M princess died wore the nits and and Olivia newton-john and you know that there was just a swag of everyone who came to Sydney okay and me and lauren bacall and Sophia Loren I mean we we had the cream of entertainers coming to Australia and they would you know the Opera House and flamingo park that 's where they went had to do both yes that is just that is truly wonderful thank you for a little walk down memory lane yeah and it 's lovely to see both enjoying your exhibition and the magic that you 've created I hope you continue to create magic thank you both very much thank you _"

    "text": "the bendigo visitors center living art space is hosting a new exhibition Flamingo Park and Beyond which celebrates the exuberant fashion of Jenny key and Linda Jackson created at their Sidney Flamingo Park frog salon and also some more recent designs key and Jackson 's iconic fashion was inspired by the Australian landscape flora and fauna and indigenous culture I caught up with local resident Linda Jackson to ask her about her remarkable career Linda you 've been described as a pioneer of australian fashion how does it feel to be described in such a way well I agree with being a pioneer because it 's like opening the door to a whole new way of looking at things and I think Jenni and I just did that in those early days breaking boundaries not being afraid to be really different and just having the courage just to be a pioneer and I 'm adventurous with a sense of curiosity so it fits you were rather adventurous adventurous he traveled for quite an extensive period of time with Happy New Guinea to Paris how did those troubles then influence you and was the end of nineteen sixty-nine and went to live in New Guinea for a year with two really close artist friends actually and we had an amazing time there and it really informed me about cultural places amazing ways that people can dress for festivals or special you know ceremonial occasions and things like that and just getting to be around people like that and then traveling there to the from there to the Philippines down to Singapore down to on a cargo ship going down to Samarkand traveling across to Bali and all those travels really informed me of amazing ways that women and and men and women mostly for me at the time dress with beautiful textiles and things like that then so dashing over to Istanbul for a little bit and of course that was amazing and then Amsterdam and living in Paris for a couple of months but my diary at the time which i still have said the list of things I had to do was of course the art galleries but the list was courage and Nell Dior balenciaga Paco Rabanne all and then also living in London for a couple of months where I could have actually met Jenny because of course she was it where she was working at the Chelsea antique market and of course I went there but as history says we 're only destined to meet people when we meant to so when did you meet her then well coming back to Australia I came back to Melbourne and then with friends who had paraphernalia in Melbourne would having an exhibition in Sydney and so I was included in that with a little collection of cute little clothes that I 'd made out of mostly 50s prints actually and I was up there I wanted to live in sydney i was really inspired by just being in sydney at the time and everyone said I you must meet Jenny key and people had said to jenni yo you must meet Linda so she came to the exhibition and we met and we were just instant comrades it was fantastic because both with glasses I traveled to the east and he had travelled to the west and we passion for art the 50s and it was an unspoken amazing friendship that still continues its that is incredibly special it would be very special for both of you yeah how did you know then that your styles were going to complement each other because they are just so incredibly unique well that was the unknown thing that we knew actually is that the exciting plant was the exciting part that how can you explain the creativity that develops between people you just have a passion for it and and also inspire each other like dressing each other are inspiring each other in that way collaborating on being inspired by Australia we just never stop talking so then during your travels where you have gone overseas to the asian countries and then also to Europe where they have such a distinct style of dress your partnership with Jenny a key i guess was an opportunity to create a I style of dress for Australia why not a Waratah I mean the rest of the world has a rose and how I have all the Chinese have a cos anthem amor 's probably more spectacular so this is our flower and we love it and it 's the same with opal why not be inspired by what 's around us because that 's the way of the world and just because people hadn 't seen the inspiration from Australia in the way that we put it out it just was a whole new way of looking at it and why not be an I didn 't want to go and live overseas anymore I wanted to be here and be proud of where you can be proud of where we are and it 's endless inspiration and it continues still on and you know even after Jenny and I went working together in the same way we 're still inspired by the same things that it comes out you can see in this exhibition the inspirations that we 've explore in our own way with our own signature in our own handwriting and that 's why it was so complimentary to each other as well how did you go about putting this exhibition together them because obviously such a long career pieces in this exhibition actually come from our own collection so that 's really important and there 's just choosing the ones going back to the beginning of Flamingo Park where we 've still have a couple of works from there and then you know coming into the beyond part it 's the future so it just shows yes a very long collaboration of actually working together and then still separately but still following our same inspirations like being true to oneself and true to one 's own passion and creativity you 've talked about pride for where you live you are a Bendigo resident how proud are you to live here and especially if this wonderful arts and culture reputation that the town 's establishing well I 'm actually a sort of a part-time permanent resident of Bendigo just because of my my family are here and they moved here 30 years ago so that started my Bendigo connection but I didn 't really know a lot about the cultural part of the city until more recently a few years ago I was in residence at latrobe University in much more about the art scene then and so this is why I 've watched things happen it 's been amazing and to see the Bendigo art gallery and the amazing collections that they 've put on and also just there 's more things happening and I guess I 've been in a lot of regional like living in Port Douglas or being in our screens or Darwin just watching communities get much more creative because more people get inspired by other people 's work I 've been inspired by many people I can help inspire others as well to be creatively positive so and watching what happens in video is fantastic wonderful well thank you so much Linda you _"
